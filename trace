line 1=>In this reprint several minor inaccuracies, most of them noted by readers, have been corrected. For example, the rune text now corresponds exactly with the runes on  Thror's  Map.  More  important  is  the  matter  of  Chapter  Five.  There  the  true  story  of  the  ending  of  the  Riddle  Game,  as  it  was  eventually  revealed  (under  pressure)  by Bilbo  to Gandalf,  is  now  given  according  to  the Red Book,  in  place  of  the  version  Bilbo  first  gave  to  his  friends,  and  actually  set  down  in  his  diary. This  departure  from  truth  on  the  part  of  a  most  honest  hobbit  was  a  portent  of great  significance.  It  does  not,  however,  concern  the  present  story,  and  those who in this edition make their first acquaintance with hobbit-lore need not troupe about it.  Its  explanation  lies in the history of the Ring, as it was set out in the chronicles of the Red Book of Westmarch, and is now told in The Lord of the Rings. <

line 3=>A final note may be added, on a point raised by several students of  the  lore of <
line 4=>the  period.  On  Thror's  Map  is  written  Here  of  old  was  Thrain  King  under  the <
line 5=>Mountain;  yet  Thrain  was  the  son  of  Thror,  the  last  King  under  the  Mountain <
line 6=>before  the  coming  of  the  dragon.  The  Map,  however,  is  not  in  error.  Names  are <
line 7=>often  repeated  in  dynasties,  and  the  genealogies  show  that  a  distant  ancestor  of <

line 13=>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with <
line 14=>nd an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing <
line 15=>in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. <
line 16=>0ctly  round  door  like  a  porthole,  painted  green,  with  a  shiny <

line 18=>omfortable  tunnel without  smoke, with  panelled walls,  and <
line 19=>floors  tiled  and  carpeted,  provided with  polished  chairs,  and  lots  and  lots of pegs <
line 20=>for  hats  and  coats - the hobbit was  fond of visitors. The  tunnel wound on  and on, <
line 21=>going  fairly  but  not  quite  straight  into  the  side  of  the  hill  -  The  Hill,  as  all  the <
line 22=>people for many miles round called  it - and many little round doors opened out of <
line 23=>it,  first  on  one  side  and  then  on  another.  No  going  upstairs  for  the  hobbit: <
line 24=>ms,  cellars,  pantries  (lots  of  these),  wardrobes  (he  had  whole <
line 25=>s), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and <
line 26=>indeed  on  the  same  passage. The  best  rooms were  all  on  the  left-hand side (going <
line 27=>in),  for  these  were  the  only  ones  to  have  windows,  deep-set  round  windows <
line 28=> garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.  <
line 29=>This  hobbit  was  a  very  well-to-do  hobbit,  and  his  name  was  Baggins.  The <

line 31=>m very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, <
line 32=>but  also  because  they  never had  any  adventures or did  anything unexpected: you <
line 33=>could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking <
line 34=>0how a Baggins had an adventure,  found himself doing and <
line 35=>saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but <

line 37=>The  mother  of  our  particular  hobbit  â€¦  what  is  a  hobbit?  I  suppose  hobbits <
line 38=>on nowadays,  since  they have become  rare  and  shy of the Big <
line 39=>They  are  (or  were)  a  little  people,  about  half  our  height, <
line 40=>earded Dwarves. Hobbits  have  no  beards. There  is  little  or <
line 41=>t  the  ordinary  everyday  sort  which  helps  them  to <
line 42=>disappear  quietly  and  quickly  when  large  stupid  folk  like  you  and  me  come <
line 43=>ng,  making  a  noise  like  elephants  which  they  can  hear  a  mile  off. <
line 44=>0ed  to  be    at  in  the  stomach;  they  dress  in  bright  colours  (chiefly <
line 45=>d  yellow);  wear  no  shoes,  because  their  feet  grow  natural  leathery  soles <
line 46=>and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long <
line 47=>good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially <
line 48=>after  dinner,  which  they  have  twice  a  day when  they  can  get  it). Now  you  know <
line 49=>enough  to  go  on  with.  As  I  was  saying,  the  mother  of  this  hobbit  -  of  Bilbo <
line 50=>Baggins, that is  - was  the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of  the  three remarkable <
line 51=> Old  Took,  head  of  the  hobbits  who  lived  across  The Water,  the <
line 52=>t the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that <
line 53=>k  ancestors  must  have  taken  a  fairy  wife.  That  was,  of <
line 54=>ly  there  was  still  something  not  entirely  hobbit-like <
line 55=>about  them,  -  and  once  in  a while members  of  the  Took-clan would go and have <
line 56=>adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and  the  family hushed  it up; but  the  fact <
line 57=>e  Tooks  were  not  as  respectable  as  the  Bagginses,  though  they <
line 58=>. Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after <
line 59=>she  became  Mrs.  Bungo  Baggins.  Bungo,  that  was  Bilbo's  father,  built  the  most <
line 60=>luxurious  hobbit-hole  for  her  (and  partly  with  her  money)  that  was  to  be  found <
line 61=>either  under  The  Hill  or  over  The  Hill  or  across  The  Water,  and  there  they <
line 62=>nd  of  their  days.  Still  it  is  probable  that  Bilbo,  her  only  son, <
line 63=>ed  and  behaved  exactly  like  a  second  edition  of  his  solid  and <
line 64=>got  something  a  bit  queer  in  his makeup  from  the Took  side, <
line 65=>ted  for  a  chance  to  come  out.  The  chance  never  arrived, <
line 66=> up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in <
line 67=>the  beautiful  hobbit-hole  built  by  his  father,  which  I  have  just described  for you, <
line 68=>until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.  <
line 69=> chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when <
line 70=>there  was  less  noise  and  more  green,  and  the  hobbits  were  still  numerous  and <
line 71=>prosperous,  and  Bilbo  Baggins  was  standing  at  his  door  after  breakfast  smoking <
line 72=>an  enormous  long  wooden  pipe  that  reached  nearly  down  to  his  woolly  toes <
line 73=>ndalf  came  by. Gandalf!  If  you  had  heard  only  a  quarter  of <
line 74=>t  him,  and  I  have  only  heard  very  little  of  all  there  is  to <
line 75=> prepared  for  any  sort  I  of  remarkable  tale.  Tales  and <
line 76=>over  the  place  wherever  he  went,  in  the  most <
line 77=>extraordinary  fashion.  He  had  not  been  down  that  way  under  The  Hill  for  ages <
line 78=>  since  his  friend  the  Old  Took  died,  in  fact,  and  the  hobbits  had <
line 79=> what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across <
line 80=>is  own  since  they  were  all  small  hobbit-boys  and <
line 81=>hobbit-girls. <
line 82=>specting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. <
line 83=>He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white <
line 84=>beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots. <
line 85=>0 said  Bilbo,  and  he  meant  it.  The  sun  was  shining,  and  the <
line 86=>0 Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows <
line 87=>that  stuck  out  further  than  the  brim  of  his  shady  hat.  "What  do  you  mean?"  be <
line 88=>said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether <
line 89=>ou  feel  good  this  morning;  or  that  it  is  morning  to  be  good <
line 90=>t  once,"  said  Bilbo.  "And  a  very  fine  morning  for  a  pipe  of <
line 91=>nto the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down  and <
line 92=>have  a  fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have  all  the day before us!" Then Bilbo <
line 93=>sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring <
line 94=>ed  up  into  the  air without  breaking  and  floated  away  over  The <
line 95=> said  Gandalf.  "But  I  have  no  time  to  blow  smoke-rings  this <
line 96=>0 for  someone  to  share  in  an  adventure  that  I  am  arranging, <
line 97=> find anyone." <
line 98=>ë so  - in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for <
line 99=>ing  uncomfortable  things! Make  you  late  for  dinner!  I <
line 100=>canâ€™t  think  what  anybody  sees  in  them,Â»  said  our  Mr.  Baggins,  and  stuck  one <
line 101=>thumb  behind  his  braces,  and  blew  out  another  even  bigger  smoke-ring. Then he <
line 102=>took out his morning  letters, and begin  to  read, pretending  to  take no more notice <
line 103=> had decided  that he was not quite his  sort,  and wanted him  to <
line 104=>d not move. He stood  leaning on his stick and gazing <
line 105=>at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even <
line 106=>d  morning!"  he  said  at  last.  "We  don't  want  any  adventures  here,  thank <

line 118=>d  gracious  me!  Not  the  wandering  wizard  that  gave <

line 147=>pantry. He had only  just had break  fast, but he  thought a cake or  two and a drink <
line 148=>would  do  him  good  after  his  fright.  Gandalf  in  the  meantime  was <
line 149=>side  the  door,  and  laughing  long  but  quietly.  After  a  while  he <
line 150=>th  the  spike  of  his  staff  scratched  a  queer  sign  on  the  hobbit's <
line 151=>front-door.  Then  he  strode  away,  just  about  the  time  when  Bilbo <

line 156=>ere came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and <
line 157=>then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and <
line 158=>ke or two, and ran to the door.  <
line 159=> or two, and ran to the door.  iting!" he was going  to say, when he saw  that  it <
line 160=>was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, <
line 161=>s  under  his  dark-green hood.  As  soon a  the door was opened, <
line 162=>he had been expected. <
line 163=>He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and "Dwalin at your service!" he <
line 164=>lbo  Baggins  at  yours!"  said  the  hobbit,  too  surprised  to  ask  any  questions <
line 165=>for  the  moment.  When  the  silence  that  followed  had  become  uncomfortable,  he <
line 166=>just  about  to  take  tea;  pray  come  and  have  some with me." A  little <
line 167=>ut  he  meant  it  kindly.  And  what  would  you  do,  if  an  uninvited <
line 168=>is things up in your hall without a word of explanation? <
line 169=>They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, <
line 170=>her even louder ring at the bell. <
line 171=> even louder ring at the bell.  and off he went to the door.  <
line 172=>"So  you  have  got  here  at  last!" was what  he was  going  to  say  to Gandalf  this <
line 173=>time.  But  it  was  not  Gandalf.  Instead  there  was  a  very  old-looking  dwarf  on  the <
line 174=>step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the <
line 175=>t as if he had been invited. <
line 176=>"I  see  they  have  begun  to  arrive  already,"  he  said  when  he  caught  sight  of <
line 177=>Dwalin's  green  hood  hanging  up.  He  hung  his  red  one  next  to  it,  and  "Balin  at <
line 178=>your service!" he said with his hand on his breast. <
line 179=>Bilbo with  a  gasp.  It was  not  the  correct  thing  to  say,  but <
line 180=>0ve had  flustered him badly. He  liked visitors, but he  liked <
line 181=>to know  them before  they arrived, and he preferred  to ask  them himself. He had a <
line 182=>horrible  thought  that  the  cakes might  run  short,  and  then  he-as  the host: he knew <
line 183=>his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without. <
line 184=>"Come  along  in,  and  have  some  tea!"  he  managed  to  say  after  taking  a  deep <
line 185=>breath. <
line 186=><

line 196=>rves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow <
line 197=>beards;  and  each  of  them  carried  a  bag  of  tools  and  a  spade.  In  they  hopped,  as <
line 198=>soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. <
line 199=>"What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your service!" said the <
line 200=>ded  the  other;  and  they  both  swept  off  their  blue  hoods  and <
line 201=> your  family's!"  replied  Bilbo,  remembering  his  manners  this <
line 202=>re already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!" <
line 203=>"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit <
line 204=>nd collect my wits, and have a drink." He had only just had a <
line 205=>sip-in  the  corner,  while  the  four  dwarves  sat  around  the  table,  and  talked  about <
line 206=>mines  and  gold  and  troubles  with  the  goblins,  and  the  depredations  of  dragons, <
line 207=>and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they <
line 208=>0adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, <
line 209=>t-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at <
line 210=>the  door!"  he  said,  blinking.  "Some  four,  I  should  say  by  the  sound,"  said  Fili. <
line 211=>"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance." <
line 212=>The  poor  little  hobbit  sat  down  in  the  hall  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and <
line 213=>wondered  what  had  happened,  and  what  was  going  to  happen,  and  whether  they <
line 214=>0o supper. Then  the bell rang again  louder  than ever, and he had  to <
line 215=> was  not  four  after  all,  t  was  FIVE.  Another  dwarf  had  come <
line 216=>ring in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re <
line 217=>they were all  inside, bowing and  saying  "at your  service" one after another. Dori, <
line 218=>Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  their  names;  and  very  soon  two  purple  hoods,  a <
line 219=>0a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they <
line 220=>0ad  hands  stuck  in  their  gold  and  silver  belts  to  join  the <
line 221=>most become a  throng. Some called  for ale, and some  for <
line 222=>porter,  and  one  for  coffee,  and  all  of  them  for  cakes;  so  the hobbit was kept very <
line 223=>busy for a while. <
line 224=>0coffee  bad  just  been  set  in  the  hearth,  the  seed-cakes were gone, <
line 225=>ere  starting  on  a  round  of  buttered  scones,  when  there  came-a <
line 226=>ing,  but  a  hard  rat-tat  on  the  hobbit's  beautiful  green  door. <
line 227=>th a stick! <
line 228=>g  the  passage,  very  angry,  and  altogether  bewildered  and <
line 229=>t  awkward  Wednesday  he  ever  remembered.  He <
line 230=>pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More <
line 231=>And  there  was  Gandalf  behind,  leaning  on  his  staff  and <
line 232=>ent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, <
line 233=>knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. <
line 234=>"Carefully!  Carefully!"  he  said.  "It  is  not  like  you,  Bilbo,  to  keep  friends <
line 235=>waiting  on  the  mat,  and  then  open  the  door  like  a  pop-gun!  Let  me  introduce <
line 236=>ombur, and especially Thorin!" <
line 237=>"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they <

line 239=>This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in <
line 240=>at  Thorin  Oakenshield  himself,  who  was  not  at  all <
line 241=>pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. <
line 242=> Bombur  was  immensely  fat  and  heavy.  Thorin  indeed  was  very <
line 243=>ng  about  service;  but  poor Mr. Baggins  said  he was  sorry <
line 244=>t  he  grunted  "pray  don't  mention  it,"  and  stopped <
line 245=>frowning. <
line 246=>said Gandalf,  looking  at  the  row of  thirteen hoods-the <
line 247=>best  detachable  party  hoods-and his own hat hanging on  the pegs. "Quite a merry <
line 248=>gathering! <
line 249=>I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? <
line 250=>ou! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said Thorin. <
line 251=>e-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and cheese," said <
line 252=>Bofur.  "And  pork-pie  and  salad,"  said  Bombur.  "And  more  cakes-and  ale-and <
line 253=>t mind," called the other dwarves through the door.  <
line 254=><
line 255=>####-"Put  on  a  few  eggs,  there's  a  good  fellow!"  Gandalf  called  after  him,  as  the <
line 256=>hobbit  stumped  off  to  the  pantries.  "And  just  bring  out  the  cold  chicken  and <
line 257=>pickles!" <
line 258=>"Seems  to  know  as  much  about  the  inside  of  my  larders  as  I  do  myself!" <

line 261=>By  the  time he had got all  the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses <
line 262=>and  plates  and  spoons  and  things  piled  up  on  big  trays,  he  was  getting  very  hot, <
line 263=>and red in the face, and annoyed. <

line 279=>s, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on <
line 280=>the  top,  with  one  hand,  while  the  hobbit  ran  after  them  almost  squeaking  with <
line 281=>fright:  "please  be  careful!"  and  "please,  don't  trouble!  I  can  manage."  But  the <

line 301=>Then  they  went  back,  and  found  Thorin  with  his  feet  on  the  fender  smoking  a <

line 307=>green  and  come  back  to  hover  over  the  wizard's  head.  He  had  quite  a  cloud  of <
line 308=>them  about  him  already,  and  in  the  dim  light  it  made  him  look  strange  and <

line 406=>To  the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps  to one or  two of <

line 413=>to feel a shriek coming up  inside, and very soon  it burst out  like  the whistle of an <
line 414=>t of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang Bp knocking over the table. <
line 415=>on  the end of his magic staff, and  in  its firework glare <
line 416=>the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly <
line 417=>that was melting. Then he fell flat on  the floor, and kept on calling out  "struck by <
line 418=>by  lightning!"  over  and  over  again;  and  that  was  all  they  could <
line 419=>or  a  long  time.  So  they  took  him  and  laid  him  out  of  the way  on <
line 420=>0sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark <
line 421=> fellow,"  said  Gandalf,  as  they  sat  down  again.  "Gets  funny <

line 424=>poetical  exaggeration  applied  to  any  hobbit,  even  to Old Took's  great-granduncle <
line 425=>so huge (for a hobbit)  that he could ride a horse. He charged <
line 426=>the  ranks  of  the  goblins  of  Mount  Gram  in  the  Battle  of  the  Green  Fields,  and <

line 434=>fierce, but one  shriek  like  that  in a moment of excitement <
line 435=>would be enough  to wake  the dragon and all his  relatives, and kill  the  lot of us.  I <
line 436=>think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the <
line 437=>sign  on  the  door,  I  should  have  been  sure  we  had  come  to  the  wrong  house.  As <

line 441=>suddenly  felt  he would  go without  bed  and  breakfast  to  be  thought  fierce. As  for <
line 442=>little  fellow  bobbing  on  the  mat  it  almost  made  him  really  fierce.  Many  a  time <
line 443=>afterwards  the  Baggins  part  regretted  what  he  did  now,  and  he  said  to  himself: <
line 444=>e a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it." <
line 445=>"Pardon me," he said, "if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don't <

line 745=>good  roads,  an  inn  or  two,  and  now  and  then  a  dwarf  or  a  farmer  ambling  by  on <
line 746=>business.  Then  they  came  to  lands where people  spoke  strangely,  and  sang  songs <
line 747=>r  heard  before.  Now  they  had  gone  on  far  into  the  Lone-lands, <
line 748=> people  left,  no  inns,  and  the  roads  grew  steadily worse. Not <

line 750=>  an  evil  look,  as  if  they  had  been  built  by  wicked <
line 751=>people.  Everything  seemed  gloomy,  for  the  weather  that  day  had  taken  a  nasty <
line 752=>turn. Mostly  it  had  been  as  good  as May  can  be,  even  in  merry  tales, but now  it <
line 753=>was  cold  and  wet.  In  the  Lone-lands  they  had  to  camp  when  they  could,  but  at <
line 754=>least  it  had  been  dry.  "To  think  it  will  soon  be  June,"  grumbled  Bilbo  as  he <
line 755=>  behind  the  others  in  a  very  muddy  track.  It  was  after  tea-time;  it <
line 756=>was  pouring with  rain, and had been all day; his hood was dripping  into his eyes, <
line 757=>ter;  the pony was  tired and stumbled on stones;  the others <
line 758=>were  too  grumpy  to  talk.  "And  I'm  sure  the  rain  has  got  into  the  dry  clothes  and <
line 759=>Bilbo. "Bother burgling and everything to do with it! <
line 760=>I wish  I was at home  in my nice hole by  the  fire, with  the kettle  just beginning  to <

line 765=>sighed. I don't know what river it was, a rushing red one, swollen with the rains of <
line 766=>the  last  few  days,  that  came  down  from  the  hills  and mountains  in  front  of  them. <
line 767=>Soon it was nearly dark. The winds broke up the grey clouds, and a waning moon <
line 768=>etween  the  flying  rags.  Then  they  stopped,  and  Thorin <
line 769=><
line 770=>####-muttered  something  about  supper,  "and  where  shall  we  get  a  dry  patch  to  sleep <

line 776=>bbit's views about  regular meals, plenty and often). They <
line 777=>decided in  the end that they would have to camp where they were. So far they had <
line 778=>0re  on  this  journey,  and  though  they  knew  that  they  soon  would <
line 779=>, when they were among the Misty Mountains and far from <
line 780=>the  lands  of  respectable  people,  it  seemed  a  bad  wet  evening  to  begin,  on.  They <
line 781=>moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the <
line 782=>s,  and  the  drip,  drip,  was  most  annoying.  Also  the  mischief <
line 783=>0he fire. Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of <
line 784=>almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not even Oin <
line 785=>e specially good at it. <
line 786=>Then one of  the ponies  took  fright at nothing and bolted. He got  into  the  river <
line 787=>d catch him; and before they could get him out again, Fili and Kili <
line 788=>  all  the  baggage  that  he  carried  was  washed  away  off <
line 789=>him. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty little left for supper, and <
line 790=>less  for  breakfast.  There  they  all  sat  glum  and wet  and muttering, while Oin  and <
line 791=>  trying  to  light  the  fire,  and  quarrelling  about  it.  Bilbo  was  sadly <
line 792=>reflecting  that  adventures  are  not  all  pony-rides  in  May-sunshine,  when  Balin, <
line 793=>ir  look-out man, said:  "There's a light over there!" There was <
line 794=>es on  it, pretty  thick  in parts. Out of  the dark mass of <
line 795=>the  trees  they  could  now  see  a  light  shining,  a  reddish  comfortable-looking light, <
line 796=>as  it  might  be  a  fire  or  torches  twinkling.  When  they  had  looked  at  it  for  some <
line 797=>while,  they  fell  to  arguing.  Some  said  "no"  and  some  said  "yes."  Some  said  they <
line 798=>could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and <
line 799=>wet  clothes  all  the  night. Others  said:  "These  parts  are  none  too well known, and <
line 800=> the mountains. Travellers  seldom  come  this way  now. The  old maps <
line 801=>ave  changed  for  the  worse  and  the  road  is  unguarded.    They <

line 803=>you  go  along,  the  less  trouble  you  are  likely  to  find."  Some  said:  "After  all  there <
line 804=>are  fourteen  of  us."  Others  said:  "Where  has  Gandalf  got  to?"  This  remark  was <
line 805=>repeated  by  everybody.  Then  the  rain  began  to  pour  down  worse  than  ever,  and <
line 806=>Oin and Gloin began to fight. That settled it. "After all we have got a burglar with <

line 811=>ling  and  creaking  (and  a good deal of grumbling  and drafting), <

line 813=>Suddenly  the  red  light  shone  out  very  bright  through  the  tree-trunks  not  far <

line 815=>0ll  about  that  light,  and what  it  is  for,  and  if  all  is  perfectly  safe and <

line 824=>0the  whole  cavalcade  had  passed  two  feet  off.  As  for  Bilbo  walking <
line 825=>he  red  light,  I  don't  suppose  even  a  weasel  would  have  stirred  a <
line 826=>So,  naturally,  he  got  right  up  to  the  fire-for  fire  it  was  without <
line 827=>e. And this is what he saw. Three very large persons sitting round <
line 828=>ech-logs. They were  toasting mutton  on  long  spits of wood, <
line 829=>and  licking  the  gravy  off  their  fingers.  There  was  a  fine  toothsome  smell.  Also <
line 830=>there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and  they were drinking out of  jugs. But <
line 831=>they were  trolls. Obviously  trolls.  Even Bilbo,  in  spite  of  his  sheltered  life,  could <
line 832=>see  that:  from  the great heavy  faces of  them, and  their size, and  the shape of  their <
line 833=>legs, not to mention their language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at <
line 834=>utton today, and blimey, if it don't look like mutton again <
line 835=>tomorrer," said one of the trolls. <
line 836=>omorrer," said one of the trolls. anflesh  have  we  had  for  long  enough,"  said  a <
line 837=>second.  "What  the  'ell William was  a-thinkin' of to bring us into these parts at all, <
line 838=>  the drink  runnin'  short, what's more," he  said  jogging the elbow of <
line 839=>ng a pull at his jug. <
line 840=>William  choked.  "Shut  yer  mouth!"  he  said  as  soon  as  he  could.  "Yer  can't <
line 841=>0stop here  for ever  just  to be et by you and Bert. You've et a village <
line 842=>, since we come down from the mountains. How much more <

line 844=>####-d'yer want? And time's been up our way, when yer'd have said 'thank yer Bill' for a <
line 845=>nice bit o'  fat valley mutton  like what  this  is." He  took a big bite off a  sheep's  leg <
line 846=>he was toasting, and wiped his lips on his sleeve. <
line 847=> behave like that, even those with only one head each. <
line 848=>After  hearing  all  this  Bilbo  ought  to  have  done  something  at  once.  Either  he <
line 849=>should  have  gone  back  quietly  and  warned  his  friends  that  there  were  three  fair-<
line 850=>at  hand  in  a  nasty  mood,  quite  likely  to  try  toasted  dwarf,  or  even <
line 851=>pony,  for  a  change;  or  else  he  should  have  done  a  bit  of  good  quick  burgling.  A <
line 852=>really  first-class  and  legendary  burglar would  at  this  point  have  picked  the  trolls' <
line 853=>pockets-it  is  nearly  always  worthwhile  if  you  can  manage  it-,  pinched  the  very <
line 854=>pite, purloined the beer, and walked off without their noticing him. <
line 855=>with less professional pride would perhaps have stuck a <
line 856=>dagger  into  each  of  them  before  they observed  it. Then  the night could have been <
line 857=>spent cheerily.  <
line 858=>d of a good many  things he had never seen or done. <
line 859=>He  was  very  much  alarmed,  as  well  as  disgusted;  he  wished  himself  a  hundred <
line 860=>0et-and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and <
line 861=>Company empty-handed. So he stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the various <
line 862=>ceedings  he  had  heard  of  picking  the  trolls'  pockets  seemed  the <
line 863=>t last he crept behind a tree just behind William. <
line 864=>Bert and Tom went off  to  the barrel. William was having another drink. Then <
line 865=>and  put  his  little  hand  in William's  enormous  pocket. <
line 866=>There was a purse in it, as big as a bag to Bilbo. "Ha!" thought he warming to his <
line 867=>new work as he lifted it carefully out, "this is a beginning!" <
line 868=>It was! Trolls' purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. " 'Ere, 'oo are <

line 877=>mighty suspicious about anything new to them. <
line 878=>icious about anything new to them.  got to do with my pocket, anyways?" said William. <
line 879=>"And can yer cook 'em?" said Tom. <
line 880=> said Tom. try," said Bert, picking up a skewer.  <

line 882=>fine supper, "not when he was skinned and boned." <

line 884=>  there  any  more  of  your  sort  a-sneakin'  in  these  here woods, <

line 895=> had had lots of beer. "Poor little blighter! Let him go!" <
line 896=>"Not  till  he  says  what  he  means  by  lots  and  none  at  all,"  said  Bert.  "I  don't <
line 897=>want to have me throat cut in me sleep. Hold his toes in the fire, till he talks!" <

line 899=> William. "I caught him anyway." iam," said Bert, "as I've said afore this evening." <
line 900=>"And you're a lout!" <

line 903=>  ground,  to  scramble  out  of  the way  of  their  feet,  before  they <
line 904=> dogs,  and  calling  one  another  all  sorts  of  perfectly  true  and <
line 905=> very  loud  voices.  Soon  they  were  locked  in  one  another's <
line 906=> into  the  fire  kicking  and  thumping, while Tom whacked <
line 907=>at  then  both  with  a  branch  to  bring  them  to  their  senses-and  that  of  course  only <
line 908=>made  them  madder  than  ever.  That  would  have  been  the  time  for  Bilbo  to  have <
line 909=>left. But his poor  little  feet had been very  squashed  in Bert's big paw,  and he had <
line 910=>no  breath  in  his  body,  and  his  head was  going  round;  so  there  he  lay  for  a while <
line 911=>panting, just outside the circle of firelight. <
line 912=>ing, just outside the circle of firelight. e  fight up  came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises <
line 913=>from  a  distance,  and  after  wait-ing  for  some  time  for  Bilbo  to  come  back,  or  to <
line 914=>hoot  like  an  owl,  they  started  off  one  by  one  to  creep  towards  the  light  as  quietly <
line 915=>as  they  could.  No  sooner  did  Tom  see  Balin  come  into  the  light  than he gave an <
line 916=><
line 917=>####-awful  howl.  Trolls  simply  detest  the  very  sight  of  dwarves  (uncooked).  Bert  and <
line 918=>Bill  stopped  fighting  immediately,  and  "a  sack,  Tom,  quick!"  they  said,  before <
line 919=>Balin,  who  was  wondering  where  in  all  this  commotion  Bilbo  was,  knew  what <
line 920=>ack was over his head, and he was down. <
line 921=>ver his head, and he was down. yet," said Tom, "or I'm mighty mistook. Lots and none <
line 922=>at  all,  it  is,"  said  he.  "No  burra-  hobbits,  but  lots  of  these  here  dwarves.  That's <
line 923=>about the shape of it!" <
line 924=>"I reckon you 're right," said Bert, "and we'd best get out of the light." <
line 925=>And  so  they  did.  With  sacks  in  their  hands,  that  they  used  for  carrying  off <
line 926=>mutton and other plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf came up and <
line 927=>e,  and  the  spilled  jugs,  and  the  gnawed mutton,  in  surprise,  pop! <
line 928=>lly  sack  over  his  head,  and  he  was  down.  Soon  Dwalin  lay  by <
line 929=>i together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap, and Oin <
line 930=>and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire. <
line 931=>said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of trouble, <
line 932=>and fought like mad, as dwarves will when cornered. <
line 933=>ast-and  he  was  not  caught  unawares.  He  came  expecting <
line 934=>mischief,  and  didn't  need  to  see  his  friends'  legs  sticking  out  of  sacks  to  tell  him <
line 935=>well. He  stood  outside  in  the  shadows  some way  off,  and <
line 936=> Who has been knocking my people about?" <
line 937=>een knocking my people about?"  Bilbo  from  behind  a  tree.  They  had  forgotten  all  about him. <
line 938=>0shes with sacks," said he. <
line 939=>"O!  are  they?"  said  Thorin,  and  he  jumped  forward  to  the  fire,  before  they <
line 940=>could  leap on him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and Bert got <
line 941=> before he could step aside. That put him out of  the battle  for a <
line 942=>.  He  caught  hold  of  Tom's  leg-as  well  as  he  could,  it  was <
line 943=>0-trunk  -but  he  was  sent  spinning  up  into  the  top  of  some <
line 944=> sparks up in Thorin's face. <
line 945=>Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made <
line 946=>can  tell  you.  But  just  at  that  moment  William  came  up  behind  and <
line 947=>ight  over  Thorin's  head  and  down  to  his  toes.  And  so  the  fight <
line 948=>le  they were  all  in  now:  all  neatly  tied  up  in  sacks, with  three <

line 950=>whether  they  should  roast  them  slowly,  or mince  them  fine  and  boil  them,  or  just <
line 951=>sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly: and Bilbo up in a bush, with his <
line 952=>clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for fear they should hear him. <
line 953=>at Gandalf  came  back. But  no  one  saw  him. The  trolls  had <
line 954=>dwarves now and eat  them  later-that was Bert's idea, and <
line 955=>after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it. <
line 956=>ing  'em  now,  itâ€™d  take  all  night,"  said  a  voice.  Bert  thought  it <
line 957=>"Don't  start  the  argument  all  over-again.  Bill,"  he  said,  "or  it  will  take  all <

line 963=>No  good  boiling  'em! We  ain't  got  no  water,  and  it's  a  long  way  to  the  well <
line 964=>and all," said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom's. <

line 966=>yerself, if yer say any more." <

line 993=>tooped;  and  Bert  and  Tom  were  stuck  like  rocks  as  they <

line 1004=>listening  to  the  trolls  making  plans  for  roasting  them  and  squashing  them  and <
line 1005=>mincing  them.  They  had  to  hear  Bilbo's  account  of  what  had  happened  to  him <

line 1024=>  in  the  air;  but  there  was  a  good  deal  of  food  jumbled <
line 1025=>  on  the  ground,  among  an  untidy  litter  of  plunder,  of  all <

line 1027=>lots  of  clothes,  too,  hanging  on  the  walls-too  small  for  trolls,  I  am  afraid  they <
line 1028=>belonged  to  victims-and  among  them  were  several  swords  of  various  makes, <
line 1029=>izes.  Two  caught  their  eyes  particularly,  because  of  their  beautiful <
line 1030=>0ewelled  hilts.  Gandalf  and  Thorin  each  took  one  of  these;  and <
line 1031=> leather sheath. It would have made only a tiny pocket-knife <
line 1032=>for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the hobbit. <
line 1033=>"These look like good blades," said the wizard, half drawing them and looking <

line 1110=>unexpected valleys, narrow with deep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet, and <
line 1111=>  surprised  to  see  trees  below  them  and  running  water  at  the <
line 1112=>llies  that  they  could  almost  leap  over;  but  very  deep  with <
line 1113=>were dark ravines that one could neither jump nor climb <

line 1133=>down  the  steep  zig-zag  path  into  the  secret  valley  of <
line 1134=>Rivendell. The air grew warmer as  they got  lower, and  the  smell of  the pine-trees <

line 1168=>think  it. Not  that  they would  care  they would only  laugh  all  the more  if you  told <
line 1169=>them  so.  They  were  elves  of  course.  Soon  Bilbo  caught  glimpses  of  them  as  the <
line 1170=>darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a little <
line 1171=>. Dwarves don't get on well with  them. Even decent enough <
line 1172=>dwarves  like  Thorin  and  his  friends  think  them  foolish  (which  is  a  very  foolish <
line 1173=>thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and laugh at <

line 1175=>"Well,  well!"  said  a  voice.  "Just  look!  Bilbo  the  hobbit  on  a  pony,  my  dear! <

line 1194=>ws, and know what  is going on among the peoples of the <
line 1195=>land,  as  quick  as water  flows,  or  quicker. But  the  dwarves were  all  for  supper  as <
line 1196=>soon  'as  possible  just  then,  and  would  not  stay.  On  they  all  went,  leading  their <

line 1228=>liked  food,  or  sleep,  or  work,  or  story-telling,  or  singing,  or  just  sitting  and <
line 1229=>or a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil things did not come into that <

line 1231=> that  house. All  of  them,  the  ponies  as well,  grew  refreshed and <

line 1233=> hopes. Their bags were filled with food and provisions light <
line 1234=>to  carry  but  strong  to  bring  them  over  the  mountain  passes.  Their  plans  were <
line 1235=>improved  with  the  best  advice.  So  the  time  came  to  mid-  summer  eve,  and  they <

line 1257=>shook  his  head;  for  if  he  did  not  altogether  approve  of  dwarves  and  their  love  of <
line 1258=>gold, he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the <
line 1259=>town  of  Dale  and  its  merry  bells,  and  the  burned  banks  of  the  bright <
line 1260=>River Running. The moon was  shining  in  a  broad  silver  crescent. He  held  up  the <

line 1301=>The  dwarves  and  the  hobbit,  helped  by  the  wise  advice  of  Elrond  and  the <

line 1303=>Long  days  after  they  had  climbed  out  of  the  valley  and  left  the  Last  Homely <
line 1304=>House  miles  behind,  they  were  still  going  up  and  up  and  up.  It  was  a  hard  path <
line 1305=>and  a  dangerous  path,  a  crooked  way  and  a  lonely  and  a  long.  Now  they  could <
line 1306=>look  back  over  the  lands  they  had  left,  laid  out  behind  them  far  below.  Far,  far <
line 1307=>away in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his own <
line 1308=>comfortable  things,  and  his  little  hobbit-hole. He shivered.  It <
line 1309=>0d  up  here,  and  the  wind  came  shrill  among  the  rocks. <
line 1310=>Boulders,  too,  at  times  came  galloping  down  the  mountain-sides,  let  loose  by <
line 1311=>midday  sun  upon  the  snow,  and  passed  among  them  (which  was  lucky),  or  over <
line 1312=>their heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill, and they <
line 1313=>alk  too  loud,  for  the echoes were uncanny, and  the silence <
line 1314=>ken-except by  the noise of water and  the wail of wind <
line 1315=>and the crack of stone. <
line 1316=>"The  summer  is  getting  on  down  below,"  thought  Bilbo,  "and  haymaking  is <
line 1317=>hey will  be  harvesting  and  blackberrying,  before we  even <
line 1318=>begin to go down the other side at this rate." And the others were thinking equally <
line 1319=>gloomy  thoughts,  although  when  they  had  said  good-bye  to  Elrond  in  the  high <
line 1320=>mmer  morning,  they'  had  spoken  gaily  of  the  passage  of  the <
line 1321=>g  swift  across  the  lands  beyond.  They  had  thought  of <
line 1322=>coming  to  the  secret  door  in  the  Lonely  Mountain,  perhaps  that  very  next  first <
line 1323=>moon  of  Autumnâ€”"  and  perhaps  it  will  be  Durin's  Day"  they  had  said.  Only <
line 1324=>Gandalf had  shaken his head  and  said nothing. Dwarves had not passed  that way <
line 1325=>Gandalf  had,  and  he  knew  how  evil  and  danger  had  grown <
line 1326=>nce  the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the <
line 1327=>goblins had spread  in secret after  the battle of  the Mines of Moria. Even  the good <

line 1335=>was  well,  until  one  day  they  met  a  thunderstorm  -  more  than  a  thunderstorm,  a <
line 1336=>thunder-battle.  You  know  how  terrific  a  really  big  thunderstorm  can  be  down  in <
line 1337=>the  land  and  in  a  river-valley;  especially  at  times  when  two  great  thunderstorms <
line 1338=>meet  and  clash. More  terrible  still  are  thunder  and  lightning  in  the  mountains  at <
line 1339=>night,  when  storms  come  up  from  East  and  West  and  make  war.  The  lightning <
line 1340=> peaks,  and  rocks  shiver,  and  great  crashes  split  the  air  and  go <
line 1341=>ing  into  every  cave  and  hollow;  and  the  darkness  is  filled  with <
line 1342=>nd sudden light. <
line 1343=>Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a <
line 1344=>all into a dim valley at one side of them. There they <
line 1345=>were  sheltering  under  a  hanging  rock  for  the  night,  and  he  lay  beneath  a  blanket <
line 1346=>and  shook  from  head  to  toe. When  he  peeped  out  in  the  lightning-flashes, he saw <
line 1347=>that  across  the  valley  the  stone-giants  were  out  and  were  hurling  rocks  at  one <
line 1348=>game, and catching  them, and  tossing  them down  into  the darkness <
line 1349=>0g  the  trees  far below, or  splintered  into  little bits with a <
line 1350=>and  a  rain,  and  the  wind  whipped  the  rain  and  the  hail <
line 1351=> so  that  an  overhanging  rock  was  no  protection  at  all. <
line 1352=>hed  and  their  ponies were  standing with  their  heads <
line 1353=>down  and  their  tails  between  their  legs,  and  some  of  them  were  whinnying  with <
line 1354=>fright.  They  could  hear  the  giants  guffawing  and  shouting  all  over  the <
line 1355=>won't  do  at  all!"  said Thorin.  "If we  don't  get  blown  off  or  drowned,  or <
line 1356=>struck by lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a <
line 1357=>  you  know  of  anywhere  better, take us there!" said Gandalf, who was <
line 1358=>nd was far from happy about the giants himself. <
line 1359=>eir  argument was  that  they  sent Fill  and Kili  to  look  for  a better <
line 1360=>ery sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some <
line 1361=>fifty  years  they  usually  got  these  sort  of  jobs  (when  everybody  could  see  that  it <
line 1362=>was  absolutely  no  use  sending Bilbo). There  is  nothing  like  looking,  if  you want <
line 1363=>to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly usually <
line 1364=>0 if  you  look,  but  it  is  not  always  quite  the  something  you  were <
line 1365=> on this occasion. <
line 1366=><
line 1367=>####-Soon  Fili  and  Kili  came  crawling  back,  holding  on  to  the  rocks  in  the  wind. <
line 1368=>"We have  found a dry cave,"  they said, "not  far  round  the next corner; and ponies <
line 1369=>nside." <

line 1371=>in the mountains were seldom unoccupied. <
line 1372=>untains were seldom unoccupied. d,  though  everybody  knew  they  could  not  have  been  long <

line 1376=>they  go  back,  sometimes,  or  where  a  passage  behind  may  lead  to,  or  what  is <
line 1377=>waiting for you inside. But now Fili and Kill's news seemed good enough. So they <
line 1378=>red  to  move.  The  wind  was  howling  and  the  thunder  still <

line 1395=>dancing  up  by  the  roof  to  amuse  them.  They  talked  and  talked,  and  forgot  about <
line 1396=>the  storm, and discussed what each would  do with his share of the treasure (when <
line 1397=> the moment did not seem so impossible); and so they dropped <
line 1398=>off  to  sleep  one  by  one.  And  that  was  the  last  time  that  they  used  the  ponies, <

line 1402=>he did sleep, he had very nasty dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the wall at the <
line 1403=>back  of  the  cave  got  bigger  and  bigger,  and  opened wider  and wider,  and  he was <
line 1404=>  but  could  not  call  out  or  do  anything  but  lie  and  look.  Then  he <
line 1405=>he floor of  the cave was giving way, and he was slipping-beginning <

line 1407=>At  that he woke up with a horrible start, and found  that part of his dream was <
line 1408=> the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. <
line 1409=>He  was  just  in  time  to  see  the  last  of  the  ponies'  tails  disappearing  into  it.  Of <
line 1410=>course  he  gave  a  very  loud  yell,  as  loud  a  yell  as  a  hobbit  can  give,  which  is <
line 1411=>surprising for their size. <
line 1412=>Out  jumped  the  goblins,  big  goblins,  great  ugly-looking  goblins,  lots  of <

line 1415=>  say  tinder  and  flint.  But  not  Gandalf.  Bilbo's  yell  had <
line 1416=> had  wakened  him  up  wide  in  a  splintered  second,  and <
line 1417=>when  goblins  came  to  grab  him,  there  was  a  terrible  flash  like  lightning  in  the <
line 1418=>cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead. <
line 1419=>The  crack  closed with  a  snap,  and  Bilbo  and  the  dwarves were  on  the wrong <
line 1420=>side  of  it! Where was Gandalf? Of  that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, <
line 1421=>not  wait  to  find  out.  It  was  deep,  deep,  dark,  such  as  only <

line 1522=>Just  at  that  moment  all  the  lights  in  the  cavern  went  out,  and  the  great  fire <

line 1535=>The  sword  went  back  into  its  sheath.  "Follow  me  quick!"  said  a  voice  fierce <

line 1599=>Quite suddenly Dori, now at the back again carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from <

line 1608=> sign of dwarves. His head was swimming, and he was far from <
line 1609=>certain  even  of  the  direction  they  had  been  going  in  when  he  had  his  fall.  He <
line 1610=>guessed  as well  as  he  could,  and  crawled  along  for  a  good way,  till  suddenly  his <
line 1611=>hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. It <
line 1612=>was  a  turning  point  in  his  career,  but  he  did  not  know  it.  He  put  the  ring  in  his <
line 1613=>pocket  almost without  thinking;  certainly  it  did  not  seem  of  any  particular  use  at <
line 1614=>the moment. He did not go much  further, but sat down on  the cold  floor and gave <
line 1615=>plete  miserableness,  for  a  long  while.  He  thought  of  himself <

line 1619=>he  had  been  left  behind;  or  why,  if  he  had  been  left  behind,  the  goblins  had  not <
line 1620=>caught  him;  or  even  why  his  head  was  so  sore.  The  truth  was  he  had  been  lying <
line 1621=>quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while. <
line 1622=> his pipe. It was not broken, and that was something. <
line 1623=>Then  he  felt  for  his  pouch,  and  there  was  some  tobacco  in  it,  and  that  was <
line 1624=>something more. Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all, and that <
line 1625=>0etely. Just as well for him, as he agreed when he came to <
line 1626=>his senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco <

line 1671=>  things  living  in  the  pools  and  lakes  in  the  hearts  of mountains: <
line 1672=>athers swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never <
line 1673=>yes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to <
line 1674=>see  in  the  blackness;  also  there  are other  things more  slimy  than  fish. Even  in  the <

line 1676=>living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark. <

line 1697=>was  watching  Bilbo  now  from  the  distance  with  his  pale  eyes  like  telescopes. <
line 1698=>Bilbo could not see him, but he was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could see <

line 1700=>and  shot off  from  the  island, while Bilbo was  sitting <
line 1701=>on  the  brink  altogether  flummoxed  and  at  the  end  of  his  way  and  his  wits. <
line 1702=>Suddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed: <

line 1705=>swallowing  noise  in  his  throat.  That  is  how  he  got  his  name,  though  he  always <
line 1706=>called himself 'my precious.' <
line 1707=>The  hobbit  jumped  nearly  out  of  his  skin when  the  hiss  came  in  his  ears,  and <

line 1712=>out,  for  he was  not  really  very  hungry  at  the moment, only  curious; otherwise he <
line 1713=>would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards. <
line 1714=>0  I  have  lost  the  dwarves  and  I  have  lost  the wizard, <
line 1715=>and I don't know where I am; and "I don't want to know, if only I can get ,away." <
line 1716=>"What's  he  got  in  his  handses?"  said Gollum,  looking  at  the  sword, which  he <

line 1718=>e which came out of Gondolin!" Gollum,  and  became  quite  polite.  "Praps  ye  sits  here  and  chats <

line 1720=>friendly,  at  any  rate  for  the  moment,  and  until  he  found  out <
line 1721=>  and  the  hobbit, whether  he was  quite  alone  really, whether <
line 1722=>  whether  Gollum  was  really  hungry.  Riddles were  all  he <
line 1723=>could  think  of.  Asking  them,  and  sometimes  guessing  them,  had  been  the  only <
line 1724=>game  he  had  ever  played  with  other  funny  creatures  sitting  in  their  holes  in  the <
line 1725=>long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept <
line 1726=>0the dark under the mountains. <
line 1727=> Very  well,"  said  Bilbo,  who  was  anxious  to  agree,  until  he  found  out  more <
line 1728=>about  the  creature, whether  he was  quite  alone, whether  he was  fierce  or  hungry, <
line 1729=>and whether he was a friend of the goblins. <

line 1753=>ately  he  had  once  heard  something  rather  like  this  before,  and <
line 1754=>ck  he  thought  of  the  answer.  "Wind,  wind  of  course,"  he  said, <
line 1755=>ed  that  he made  up  one  on  the  spot.  "This'll  puzzle  the  nasty <
line 1756=>ature," he thought: <

line 1764=>id Gollum. He had been underground a long long time, and was <
line 1765=>forgetting  this  sort  of  thing.  But  just  as  Bilbo  was  beginning  to  hope  that  the <
line 1766=>wretch  would  not  be  able  to  answer,  Gollum  brought  up  memories  of  ages  and <
line 1767=>ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a <
line 1768=>eciouss," he said. "Sun on the daisies it means, it does." <
line 1769=>But  these  ordinary  aboveground  everyday  sort  of  riddles  were  tiring  for  him. <
line 1770=>Also  they  reminded  him  of  days  when  he  had  been  less  lonely  and  sneaky  and <
line 1771=>0ut him out of temper. What is more they made him hungry; so this <
line 1772=>more difficult and more unpleasant: <
line 1773=>difficult and more unpleasant: t be felt, <

line 1779=><
line 1780=> <
line 1781=>Unfortunately  for  Gollum  Bilbo  had  heard  that  sort  of  thing  before;  and  the <
line 1782=>answer  was  all  round  him  anyway.  "Dark!"  he  said  without  even  scratching  his <
line 1783=> his thinking cap. <
line 1784=> <
line 1785=><
line 1786=>A box without hinges, key, or lid, <

line 1789=> he could  think of a really hard one. This he  thought a <
line 1790=>dreadfully  easy  chestnut,  though  he  had  not  asked  it  in  the  usual  words.  But  it <
line 1791=>proved a nasty poser for Gollum. He hissed to himself, and still he did not answer; <
line 1792=>0spluttered. <
line 1793=> Bilbo  became  impatient.  "Well,  what  is  it?"  he  said.  "The <
line 1794=>oiling  over,  as  you  seem  to  think  from  the  noise  you  are <
line 1795=>; let it give us a chance, my preciouss-ss-ss." <
line 1796=>lbo, after giving him a long chance, "what about your guess?" <
line 1797=>But  suddenly  Gollum  remembered  thieving  from  nests  long  ago,  and  sitting <
line 1798=>under  the  river bank  teaching his grandmother,  teaching his grandmother  to suck-<
line 1799=>ggses it is!" Then he asked: <
line 1800=> <
line 1801=><
line 1802=> as death; <
line 1803=>drinking, <
line 1804=>nking. <
line 1805=>rn  thought  this  was  a  dreadfully  easy  one,  because  he  was <
line 1806=>answer. But  he  could  not  remember  anything  better  at  the <
line 1807=>  by  the  egg-question. All  the  same  it was  a poser  for <
line 1808=>poor  Bilbo,  who  never  had  anything  to  do  with  the  water  if  he  could  help  it.  I <
line 1809=>imagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking, since <
line 1810=>you  are  sitting  comfortably  at  home  and  have  not  the  danger  of  being  eaten  to <
line 1811=>0inking.  Bilbo  sat  and  cleared  his  throat  once  or  twice,  but  no <
line 1812=>fter  a  while  Gollum  began  to  hiss  with  pleasure  to  himself:  "Is  it  nice,  my <
line 1813=>preciousss? Is it juicy? Is it scrumptiously crunchable?" He began to peer at Bilbo <
line 1814=>ess. <
line 1815=>the  hobbit  shivering.  "I  gave  you  a  good  long  chance <
line 1816=>just now." <
line 1817=>  haste!"  said Gollum,  beginning  to  climb  out  of  his  boat <
line 1818=>bo. But when he put his long webby foot in the water, a <
line 1819=>fish jumped out in a fright and fell on Bilbo's toes. <
line 1820=>,  "it  is  cold  and  clammy!"-and  so  he  guessed.  "Fish!  Fish!"  he <
line 1821=><
line 1822=>inted;  but Bilbo  asked  another  riddle  as  quick <
line 1823=>as ever be could, so that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think. <
line 1824=>egs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some. <

line 1826=>0rouble  guessing  it,  if  he  had  asked  it  at  another time. As it <
line 1827=>  "no-legs" was not so very difficult, and after that the rest was <
line 1828=>ble, man at  table sitting on a stool,  the cat has  the bones"-<
line 1829=>er,  and  Gollum  soon  gave  it.  Then  he  thought  the  time <
line 1830=>and horrible. This is what he said: <
line 1831=>orrible. This is what he said: vours:  <
line 1832=>This is what he said: vours:  lowers;  <

line 1836=><
line 1837=> <
line 1838=>Poor  Bilbo  sat  in  the  dark  thinking  of  all  the  horrible  names  of  all  the  giants <
line 1839=>and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these <
line 1840=>things.  He  had  a  feeling  that  the  answer  was  quite  different  and  that  he  ought  to <
line 1841=>know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get frightened, and that is bad for <
line 1842=>egan  to  get  out  of  his  boat.  He  flapped  into  the  water  and <
line 1843=> Bilbo  could  see  his  eyes  coming  towards  him.  His  tongue <
line 1844=>uth; he wanted  to  shout out:  "Give me more  time! Give <
line 1845=>me time!" But all that came out with a sudden squeal was: <

line 1848=>hat of course was the answer.  ointed  once more;  and  now  he was  getting  angry,  and also <
line 1849=>made  him  very  hungry  indeed.  This  time  he  did  not  go <
line 1850=>back  to  the  boat.  He  sat  down  in  the  dark  by  Bilbo.  That  made  the  hobbit  most <
line 1851=>dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered his wits. <
line 1852=> ask  uss  a  quesstion, my  preciouss, yes, yess, yesss.  Jusst one more <

line 1854=>But  Bilbo  simply  could  not  think  of  any  question  with  that  nasty  wet  cold <
line 1855=> next  to  him,  and  pawing  and  poking  him.  He  scratched  himself,  he <

line 1861=> about. What have I got in my pocket?" he said aloud. He was talking to himself, but <
line 1862=>was a riddle, and he was frightfully upset. <
line 1863=> and he was frightfully upset. !" he hissed. "It isn't fair, my precious, is it, to ask us what it's <
line 1864=>0pocketses?" <
line 1865=>ad happened and having nothing better  to ask stuck  to his <
line 1866=>question. "What have I got in my pocket?" he said louder.  <
line 1867=>"S-s-s-s-s,"  hissed  Gollum.  "It  must  give  us  three  guesseses,  my  preciouss, <

line 1871=>uckily just taken his hand <
line 1872=>out again. "Guess again!" <
line 1873=>"S-s-s-s-s,"  said Gollum more  upset  than  ever. He  thought  of  all  the  things  he <
line 1874=>own  pockets:  fishbones,  goblins'  teeth, wet  shells,  a  bit  of  bat-wing, a <
line 1875=>sharp stone to sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. He tried to think what <
line 1876=>ir pockets. <
line 1877=> last. <
line 1878=> had lost his some time ago. "Last guess!" <
line 1879=>s some time ago. "Last guess!" a much worse  state  than when  Bilbo  had  asked  him  the <
line 1880=>egg-question.  He  hissed  and  spluttered  and  rocked  himself  backwards  and <
line 1881=>0pped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but still he <
line 1882=>ast guess. <
line 1883=>aid  Bilbo.  "I  am waiting!" He  tried  to  sound  bold  and  cheerful, <
line 1884=>l  at  all  sure  how  the  game  was  going  to  end,  whether  Gollum <
line 1885=>"Time's up!" he said. <
line 1886=>"String,  or  nothing!"  shrieked  Gollum,  which  was  not  quite  fair-working  in <
line 1887=>. <
line 1888=> very much  relieved;  and  he  jumped  at  once  to  his <
line 1889=>feet,  put  his  back  to  the  nearest  wall,  and  held  out  his  little  sword.  He  knew,  of <
line 1890=>course,  that  the  riddle-game  was  sacred  and  of  immense  antiquity,  and  even <
line 1891=>wicked creatures were afraid  to cheat when  they played at  it. But he  felt he could <
line 1892=>my thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do for <
line 1893=>ter all that last question had not been a genuine riddle <
line 1894=>according to the ancient laws. <
line 1895=>But at any  rate Gollum did not at once attack him. He could  see  the  sword  in <
line 1896=> sat  still,  shivering  and  whispering.  At  last  Bilbo  could  wait  no <
line 1897=>e said. "What about your  promise? I want to go. You must show me <
line 1898=>ecious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. <
line 1899=>But what has  it got  in  its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but not nothing. Oh <
line 1900=>no! gollum!" <
line 1901=>o. "A promise is a promise." <
line 1902=>"Cross  it  is,  impatient,  precious,"  hissed  Gollum.  "But  it  must  wait,  yes  it <
line 1903=>must. We  can't  go  up  the  tunnels  so  hasty. We must  go  and  get  some  things  first, <
line 1904=>yes, things to help us." <
line 1905=>up!"  said  Bilbo,  relieved  to  think  of  Gollum  going  away.  He <
line 1906=>0g an excuse and did not mean to come back. What was <
line 1907=>Gollum talking about? What useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake? But <
line 1908=>id  mean  to  come  back.  He  was  angry  now  and  hungry.  <
line 1909=>And he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he had a plan. <
line 1910=>and,  of  which  Bilbo  knew  nothing,  and  there  in  his <
line 1911=>hiding-place he kept a few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing, very <
line 1912=>0onderful. He had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring. <
line 1913=>"My  birthday-present!"  he  whispered  to  himself,  as  he  had  often  done  in  the <
line 1914=>endless dark days. "That's what we wants now, yes; we wants it!" <
line 1915=><
line 1916=>####-He  wanted  it  because  it  was  a  ring  of  power,  and  if  you  slipped  that  ring on <
line 1917=>your  finger,  you  were  invisible;  only  in  the  full  sunlight  could  you  be  seen,  and <
line 1918=>then only by your shadow, and that would be shaky and faint. <
line 1919=>"My  birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious," So he had <
line 1920=> But  who  knows  how Gollum  came  by  that  present,  ages <
line 1921=>ago  in  the old days when such rings were still at  large  in  the world? Perhaps even <
line 1922=>the Master who ruled them could not have said. Gollum used to wear it at first, till <
line 1923=>hen he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled him; and now <
line 1924=>e in the rock on his island, and was always going back to <
line 1925=>look  at  it.  And  still  sometimes  he  put  it  on,  when  he  could  not  bear  to  be  parted <
line 1926=>from  it  any  longer,  or when  he was  very,  very,  hungry, and  tired of  fish. Then he <
line 1927=>would creep along dark passages looking for stray goblins. He might even venture <
line 1928=>e  the  torches  were  lit  and made  his  eyes  blink  and  smart;  for  he <
line 1929=>Oh  yes,  quite  safe.  No  one  would  see  him,  no  one  would  notice <
line 1930=>his  fingers  on  their  throat. Only  a  few  hours  ago  he  had worn  it, <
line 1931=> goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to <
line 1932=>softer.  <
line 1933=>he  whispered  to  himself.  "It  won't  see  us,  will  it,  my <
line 1934=> and its nassty little sword will be useless, yes quite." <
line 1935=>That is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from Bilbo's <
line 1936=> back  to  his  boat,  and  went  off  into  the  dark.  Bilbo  thought  he <
line 1937=>st  of  him. Still  he waited  a while;  for  he  had  no  idea  how  to  find <
line 1938=>e. <
line 1939=>ech.  It  sent  a  shiver  down  his  back.  Gollum  was <
line 1940=>cursing and wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. He was <
line 1941=>abbling here and there, searching and seeking in vain. <
line 1942=>"Where is it? Where iss it?" Bilbo heard him crying. "Losst it is, my precious, <
line 1943=>d crush us, my precious is lost!" <
line 1944=>rush us, my precious is lost!" lled. "What have you lost?" <
line 1945=>"It mustn't  ask  us,"  shrieked Gollum.  "Not  its  business,  no,  gollum!  It's  losst, <
line 1946=>gollum, gollum, gollum." <
line 1947=>"Well,  so  am  I,"  cried  Bilbo,  "and  I want  to  get  unlost. And  I won  the  game, <

line 1949=>looking!" <
line 1950=> Gollum  sounded,  Bilbo  could  not  find  much  pity  in  his <

line 1952=>something good. <
line 1953=>d. <
line 1954=> Gollum  answered.  "We  must  search  for  it,  it's  lost, <
line 1955=>gollum." <
line 1956=>y last question, and you promised," said Bilbo. <
line 1957=>"  said Gollum. Then  suddenly out of  the gloom came a  sharp <
line 1958=>hiss. "What has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell first." <
line 1959=> knew,  there  was  no  particular  reason  why  he  should  not  tell. <
line 1960=>d to a guess quicker than his; naturally, for Gollum had <
line 1961=>brooded  for  ages  on  this  one  thing,  and  he  was  always  afraid  of  its  being  stolen. <
line 1962=>But Bilbo was annoyed at  the delay. After all, he had won  the game, pretty fairly, <
line 1963=>at a horrible risk. "Answers were to be guessed not given," he said. <
line 1964=>"But it wasn't a fair question," said Gollum. "Not a riddle, precious, no." <
line 1965=>tter  of  ordinary  questions,"  Bilbo  replied,  "then  I  asked <
line 1966=>? Tell me that!" <
line 1967=>"What has it got in its pocketses?" The sound came hissing louder and sharper, <
line 1968=>,  to his alarm  Bilbo now saw two small points of light <
line 1969=>peering  at  him. As  suspicion  grew  in Gollum's mind,  the  light  of  his  eyes  burned <
line 1970=>with a pale flame. <
line 1971=> Bilbo persisted. But now the light in Gollum's eyes had <
line 1972=>become  a  green  fire,  and  it  was  coming  swiftly  nearer.  Gollum  was  in  his  boat <
line 1973=>again,  paddling  wildly  back  to  the  dark  shore;  and  such  a  rage  of  loss  and <
line 1974=>n his heart that no sword had any more terror for him. <
line 1975=>Bilbo  could  not  guess  what  had maddened  the  wretched  creature,  but  he  saw <
line 1976=>nd that Gollum meant to murder him at any rate. Just in time he <
line 1977=>  up  the  dark  passage  down  which  he  had  come, <
line 1978=>keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand. <
line 1979=>"What  has  it  got  in  its  pocketses?"  he heard  the hiss  loud behind him, and  the <
line 1980=>0leapt from his boat. <
line 1981=>"What have I, I wonder?" he said to himself, as he panted and stumbled along. <
line 1982=> pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly slipped on to <
line 1983=>his groping forefinger.  <
line 1984=>The  hiss  was  close  behind  him.  He  turned  now  and  saw  Gollum's  eyes  like <
line 1985=>s  coming  up  the  slope.  Terrified  he  tried  to  run  faster,  but <
line 1986=>toes on a snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little sword <
line 1987=>Gollum was on him. But before Bilbo could do anything, recover <
line 1988=>his breath, pick himself up, or wave his sword, Gollum passed by, taking no notice <
line 1989=>of him, cursing and whispering as he ran. <
line 1990=>as he ran. hat could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. Bilbo could see the light of <
line 1991=>0  shining  even  from  behind.  Painfully  he  got  up,  and  sheathed  his <
line 1992=> now  glowing  faintly  again,  then  very  cautiously  he  followed. <
line 1993=>0 to do. It was no good crawling back down to Gollum's <
line 1994=>water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might lead him to some way of escape <
line 1995=>0se  it!  curse  it!  curse  it!"  hissed  Gollum.  "Curse  the  Baggins!  It's  gone! <
line 1996=>What has it got in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my precious. He's found <
line 1997=>y birthday-present." <
line 1998=>Bilbo  pricked  up  his  ears.  He  was  at  last  beginning  to  guess  himself.  He <
line 1999=>  getting  as  close  as  he  dared  behind  Gollum,  who  was  still  going <
line 2000=>king  back,  but  turning  his  head  from  side  to  side,  as Bilbo  could <
line 2001=> glimmer on the walls. <
line 2002=>"My birthday-present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that's it. <
line 2003=>  last, when we  twisted  that nassty young squeaker. That's <
line 2004=>it. Curse it! It slipped from us, after all these ages and ages! It's gone, gollum." <
line 2005=>Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound <
line 2006=>horrible  to  listen  to.  Bilbo  halted  and  flattened  himself  against  the  tunnel-wall. <
line 2007=>After a while Gollum stopped weeping and began to talk. He seemed to be having <
line 2008=>0himself. <
line 2009=>  back  there  to  search,  no.  We  doesn't  remember  all  the <

line 2019=>will catch it then. It can't get out that way, precious." <
line 2020=>"Ssss,  sss,  gollum!  Goblinses!  Yes,  but  if  it's  got  the  present,  our  precious <

line 2027=> and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!" <
line 2028=> Go! Not far now. Make haste!" got up  and  started  shambling off  at  a great pace. Bilbo <
line 2029=>hurried  after  him,  still  cautiously,  though  his  chief  fear  now  was  of  tripping  on <
line 2030=>another snag and falling with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope and wonder. <
line 2031=>It  seemed  that  the  ring  he  had  was  a  magic  ring:  it  made  you  invisible!  He  had <
line 2032=>heard  of  such  things,  of  course,  in old old  tales; but  it was hard  to believe  that he <
line 2033=>really  had  found  one,  by  accident.  Still  there  it was: Gollum with  his  bright  eyes <
line 2034=>had passed him by, only a yard to one side. <
line 2035=>to one side. n  they  went,  Gollum  flip-flapping  ahead,  hissing  and  cursing;  Bilbo  behind <
line 2036=>going  as  softly  as  a  hobbit  can.  Soon  they  came  to  places  where,  as  Bilbo  had <
line 2037=>noticed  on  the way  down,  side-passages opened, this way and that. Gollum began <
line 2038=>"One  left,  yes. One  right,  yes. Two  right,  yes,  yes. Two  left,  yes,  yes." And so <
line 2039=>on and on. <
line 2040=>owed down, and he began  to get shaky and weepy; for <
line 2041=>he  was  leaving  the  water  further  and  further  behind,  and  he  was  getting  afraid. <
line 2042=>Goblins  might  be  about,  and  he  had  lost  his  ring.  At  last  he  stopped  by  a  low <
line 2043=>opening, on their left as they went up. <
line 2044=>ey went up. en  right,  yes.  Six  left,  yes!"  he  whispered.  "This  is  it.  This  is  the  way  to <
line 2045=>the back-door, yes. Here's the passage!" <
line 2046=>k-door, yes. Here's the passage!" ank  back.  "But  we  durstn't  go  in,  precious,  no  we <
line 2047=>durstn't. Goblinses down there. Lots of goblinses. We smells them. Ssss!" <
line 2048=>0them and crush them! We must wait here, precious, <
line 2049=>wait a bit and see." <
line 2050=>dead  stop. Gollum  had  brought  Bilbo  to  the way  out  after <
line 2051=>get  in!  There was Gollum  sitting humped up  right  in  the <
line 2052=>opening,  and his  eyes gleamed  cold  in his head,  as he  swayed  it  from  side  to  side <
line 2053=>between his knees. <
line 2054=>way  from  the  wall  more  quietly  than  a  mouse;  but  Gollum <
line 2055=>iffed,  and  his  eyes  went  green.  He  hissed  softly  but <
line 2056=>menacingly. He could not see  the hobbit, but now he was on  the alert, and he had <
line 2057=>other senses  that  the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. He seemed  to be <
line 2058=>th  his  flat  hands  splayed  on  the  floor, and his head  thrust <
line 2059=>he stone. Though he was only a black shadow in the gleam of <
line 2060=>his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered for <
line 2061=>a spring. <
line 2062=>Bilbo  almost  stopped  breathing,  and  went  stiff  himself. He was desperate. He <
line 2063=>must  get  away,  out  of  this  horrible  darkness,  while  he  had  any  strength  left.  He <
line 2064=>must  fight.  He  must  stab  the  foul  thing,  put  its  eyes  out,  kill  it.  It  meant  to  kill <
line 2065=>him.  No,  not  a  fair  fight.  He  was  invisible  now.  Gollum  had  no  sword. Gollum <
line 2066=>had  not  actually  threatened  to  kill  him,  or  tried  to  yet.  And  he  was  miserable, <
line 2067=>alone, lost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled up in Bilbo's <
line 2068=> endless  unmarked  days  without  light  or  hope  of  betterment, <
line 2069=>king and whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash <
line 2070=>of a second. He  trembled. And  then quite suddenly  in another flash, as  if  lifted by <
line 2071=>a new strength and resolve, he leaped. <
line 2072=>e leaped. great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum's head he <
line 2073=>et  forward  and  three  in  the  air;  indeed, had he known  it, he only <
line 2074=>his skull on the low arch of the passage. <
line 2075=>n the low arch of the passage. f  backwards,  and  grabbed  as  the  hobbit  flew  over  him, <
line 2076=>but  too  late:  his  hands  snapped  on  thin  air,  and  Bilbo,  falling  fair  on  his  sturdy <
line 2077=>unnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum was doing. <
line 2078=>There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at  first,  then  it stopped. All at <
line 2079=>e  a  bloodcurdling  shriek,  filled  with  hatred  and  despair.  Gollum <
line 2080=>d go no  further. He had  lost:  lost his prey, and  lost,  too,  the <
line 2081=>0red for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo's heart to his <
line 2082=>mouth,  but  still  he  held  on. Now  faint  as  an  echo,  but menacing,  the  voice  came <
line 2083=>behind: <
line 2084=>s! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it for ever!" <
line 2085=>Then  there was  a  silence. But  that  too  seemed menacing  to Bilbo.  "If  goblins <
line 2086=> he  smelt  them," he  thought, "then  they'll have heard his shrieking <
line 2087=>w, or this way will lead you to worse things." <
line 2088=>ill lead you to worse things." low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the hobbit, <
line 2089=>except when,  in  spite of all care, he  stubbed his poor  toes again, several times, on <
line 2090=>nasty  jagged  stones  in  the  floor.  "A  bit  low  for  goblins,  at  least  for  the  big  ones," <
line 2091=>hat  even  the  big  ones,  the  ores  of  the mountains,  go <

line 2094=>while  it  climbed  steeply.  That  slowed  Bilbo  down.  But  at  last  the  slope  stopped, <
line 2095=>the passage  turned a corner, and dipped down again, and  there, at  the bottom of a <
line 2096=>0ine,  he  saw,  filtering  round  another  corner-a  glimpse  of  light.  Not  red <
line 2097=>light,  as  of  fire  or  lantern,  but  a  pale  out-of-doors  sort of  light. Then Bilbo began <
line 2098=>to run. <
line 2099=>Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and came <
line 2100=>  into  an  open  space, where  the  light,  after  all  that  time  in  the  dark, <
line 2101=>seemed  dazzlingly  bright.  Really  it  was  only  a  leak  of  sunshine  in  through  a <
line 2102=> great door, a stone door, was left standing open. <
line 2103=>Bilbo  blinked,  and  then  suddenly  he  saw  the  goblins:  goblins  in  full  armour <
line 2104=>itting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and <
line 2105=>to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for anything. <
line 2106=>They saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it was .an <
line 2107=>  of  the  ring  before  it  took  a  new master,  it was  not  on  his <
line 2108=>elight the goblins rushed upon him. <
line 2109=>t the goblins rushed upon him. s,  like  an  echo  of  Gollum's  misery,  smote  Bilbo,  and <
line 2110=>forgetting even  to draw his sword he struck his hands  into his pockets. And- there <
line 2111=>was  the  ring  still,  in  his  left  pocket,  and  it  slipped  on  his  finger.  The  goblins <
line 2112=>stopped  short.  They  could  not  see  a  sign  of  him.  He  had  vanished.  They  yelled <
line 2113=>twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.  <

line 2122=>happened and to sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblin-guards, <
line 2123=>and  so  get  out  of  the  way  and  avoid  being  bumped  into,  trampled  to  death,  or <
line 2124=><
line 2125=> must  get  to  the  door!"  he  kept  on  saying  to  himself, <
line 2126=>ore  he ventured  to  try. Then  it was  like a horrible game <
line 2127=>of  blind-man's  buff.  The  place  was  full  of  goblins  running  about,  and  the  poor <
line 2128=>little  hobbit  dodged  this  way  and  that,  was  knocked  over  by  a  goblin  who  could <
line 2129=>not  make  out  what  he  had  bumped  into,  scrambled  away  on  all  fours,  slipped <
line 2130=>between the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door.  <
line 2131=>goblin  had  pushed  it  nearly  to.  Bilbo  struggled  but  he <
line 2132=>d  to  squeeze  through  the  crack.  He  squeezed  and <
line 2133=><
line 2134=>####-squeezed, and he  stuck!  It was awful. His buttons had got wedged on  the edge of <
line 2135=>the  door  and  the  door-post.  He  could  see  outside  into  the  open  air:  there  were  a <
line 2136=>few  steps  running  down  into  a  narrow  valley  between  tall  mountains;  the  sun <
line 2137=>hind  a  cloud  and  shone  bright  on  the  outside  of  the  door-but he <
line 2138=>h. <
line 2139=>ins  inside  shouted:  "There  is  a  shadow  by  the  door. <
line 2140=>Something is outside!" <
line 2141=>Bilbo's  heart  jumped  into  his mouth. He  gave  a  terrific  squirm. Buttons burst <
line 2142=>ns. He was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping down <
line 2143=>bewildered goblins were still picking up his nice brass <
line 2144=>buttons on the doorstep. <
line 2145=>Of course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and hunting <
line 2146=>among  the  trees. But  they  don't  like  the  sun:  it makes  their  legs wobble  and  their <
line 2147=>heads giddy. They could not find Bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and out of the <
line 2148=>shadow of  the  trees,  running quick and quiet, and keeping out of  the sun; so soon <
line 2149=>ling and cursing to guard the door. Bilbo had escaped. <

line 2158=>0to  sink westwards-behind  the mountains. Their shadows fell across <
line 2159=>oked  back.  Then  he  looked  forward  and  could  see  before <

line 2164=>arves  have  got  to?  I  only  hope  to  goodness  they  are  not <
line 2165=>r of the goblins!" <
line 2166=>He  still wandered on, out of  the  little high valley, over  its edge, and down  the <
line 2167=>l the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside <
line 2168=>him.  He  wondered  whether  he  ought  not,  now  he  had  the magic  ring,  to  go  back <
line 2169=>into  the  horrible,  horrible,  tunnels  and  look  for  his  friends.  He  had  just made  up <
line 2170=>his  mind  that  it  was  his  duty,  that  he  must  turn  back-and  very miserable  he  felt <
line 2171=>about it-when he heard voices. <
line 2172=>He  stopped  and  listened.  It  did  not  sound  like  goblins;  so  he  crept  forward <
line 2173=>carefully. He was  on  a  stony  path winding  downwards with  a  rocky wall.  on  the <
line 2174=>her side the ground sloped away and there were dells below the <
line 2175=>level  of  the  path  overhung with  bushes  and  low  trees.  In  one  of  these  dells  under <
line 2176=> <
line 2177=>denly he saw peering between  two big boulders a <
line 2178=>head with a red hood on:  it was Balin doing  look-out. He could have clapped and <
line 2179=>  did  not.  He  had  still  got  the  ring  on,  for  fear  of  meeting <
line 2180=>nd unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was looking straight <
line 2181=>at him without noticing him. <
line 2182=>"I will  give  them  all  a  surprise,"  he  thought,  as  he  crawled  into  the  bushes at <
line 2183=>the edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They were discussing <
line 2184=>d  to  them  in  the  tunnels,  and  wondering  and  debating  what <
line 2185=>  dwarves were  grumbling,  and Gandalf was  saying  that <
line 2186=>they could not possibly go on with their journey leaving Mr. Baggins in the hands <
line 2187=> without  trying  to  find  out  if  he  was  alive  or  dead,  and  without <
line 2188=>im. <
line 2189=>my  friend,"  said  the  wizard,  "and  not  a  bad  little  chap.  I  feel <

line 2197=>look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out of <
line 2198=>the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him again, you will thank <
line 2199=>r. Whatever did you want to go and drop him for, Dori?" <
line 2200=>"You would  have  dropped  him,"  said Dori,  "if a goblin had suddenly grabbed <
line 2201=>d  in  the  dark,  tripped  up  your  feet,  and  kicked  you  in  the <

line 2203=>"Good  heavens!  Can  you  ask!  Goblins  fighting  and  biting  in  the  dark, <

line 2206=>Orcrist.  All  of  a  sudden  you  gave  one  of  your  blinding  flashes,  and  we  saw  the <
line 2207=>goblins running back yelping. You shouted 'follow me everybody!' and everybody <
line 2208=>e  thought  everybody  had. There was  no  time  to  count, <
line 2209=>as  you  know  quite  well,  till  we  had  dashed  through  the  gate-guards,  out  of  the <

line 2212=>glar!"  said  Bilbo  stepping  down  into  the  middle  of  them, <
line 2213=>less  me,  how  they  jumped!  Then  they  shouted  with  surprise  and  delight. <
line 2214=>Gandalf was as astonished as any of  them, but probably more pleased than all the <
line 2215=> and told him what he thought of a look-out man who let <
line 2216=>people  walk  right  into  them  like  that  without  warning.  It  is  a  fact  that  Bilbo's <

line 2340=>able  down  the  gentle  slopes  of  a  pine  forest  in  a  slanting  path  leading  steadily <
line 2341=>southwards. At  times  they were pushing  through a sea of bracken with  tall  fronds <
line 2342=>rising  right  above  the  hobbit's  head;  at  times  they  were  marching  along  quiet  as <
line 2343=>quiet  over  a  floor  of  pine-needles;  and  all  the  while  the  forest-gloom got heavier <

line 2351=>"A bit further," said Gandalf. <
line 2352=>After  what  seemed  ages  further  they  came  suddenly  to  an  opening  where  no <

line 2357=>by  another  not  far  away  to  the  left.  It  was  wolves  howling  at  the  moon,  wolves <
line 2358=>gathering together! <
line 2359=>olves living near Mr. Baggins' hole at home, but he knew that <
line 2360=>noise.  He  had  had  it  described  to  him  often  enough  in  tales.  One  of  his  elder <
line 2361=>cousins  (on  the  Took  side),  who  had  been  a  great  traveller,  used  to  imitate  it  to <
line 2362=>frighten him. To hear  it  out  in  the forest under  the moon was  too much for Bilbo. <
line 2363=>Even  magic  rings  are  not  much  use  against  wolves-especially  against  the  evil <
line 2364=>d under the shadow of the goblin-infested mountains, over the Edge <

line 2370=>he fire' in the same sort of uncomfortable situations. <
line 2371=>"Up the trees quick!" cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the <
line 2372=> those  that  had  branches  fairly  low,  or  were  slender  enough  to <
line 2373=>d  them  as  quick  as  ever  they  could,  you  can  guess;  and  up <

line 2376=>beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. <

line 2378=>Nori,  On,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  more  comfortable  in  a  huge  pine  with  regular <

line 2392=>0ng  nearer  and  nearer.  "Dori!"  he  called,  for  Dori  was <
line 2393=>lowest down in the easiest tree, "be quick, and give Mr. Baggins a hand up!" <
line 2394=>decent fellow in spite of his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could not <
line 2395=>reach  his  hand  even  when  he  climbed  down  to  the  bottom  branch  and  hung  his <
line 2396=>arm down as far as ever he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the tree and let <

line 2398=>Just  at  that  moment  the  wolves  trotted  howling  into  the  clearing.  All  of  a <

line 2401=>the branches himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped- at his <

line 2414=>hundreds  it  seemed) went  and  sat  in  a  great  circle  in  the  glade;  and  in the middle <
line 2415=>of  the circle was a great grey wolf. He  spoke  to  them  in  the dreadful  language of <
line 2416=>the  Wargs.  Gandalf  understood  it.  Bilbo  did  not,  but  it  sounded  terrible  to  him, <
line 2417=>and  as  if  all  their  talk  was  about  cruel  and  wicked  things,  as  it  was.  Every  now <
line 2418=>and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their grey chief all together, and <
line 2419=> almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree. <
line 2420=>I  will  tell  you  what  Gandalf  heard,  though  Bilbo  did  not  understand  it.  The <
line 2421=>oblins  often  helped  one  another  in wicked  deeds. Goblins  do  not <
line 2422=>ar  from  their mountains, unless  they  are driven out  and  are <
line 2423=>  are marching  to  war  (which  I  am  glad  to  say  has  not <

line 2427=>d  that  a  great  goblin-raid  had  been  planned  for  that <

line 2429=>The  reason,  no  doubt,  was  the  death  of  the  Great  Goblin,  and  all  the  excitement <

line 2435=>y of  them, and  they were brave and well-armed, and even <
line 2436=>the Wargs dared not attack  them  if  there were many  together, or  in  the bright day. <
line 2437=>But  now  they  had  planned with  the  goblins'  help  to  come  by  night  upon  some  of <
line 2438=>the  villages nearest  the mountains.  If  their plan had been carried out,  there would <
line 2439=>  there next day;  all would have been killed  except  the  few  the <
line 2440=>es and carried back as prisoners to their caves. <
line 2441=><
line 2442=>####-This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and <
line 2443=>ren,  but  also  because  of  the  danger  which  now  threatened <
line 2444=>e Wargs were  angry  and puzzled  at  finding  them here <
line 2445=>in  their  very meeting-place. They  thought  they were  friends of  the woodmen, and <
line 2446=> spy  on  them,  and  would  take  news  of  their  plans  down  into  the <

line 2449=>no  intention  of  going  away  and  letting  the  people  up  the <
line 2450=>t until morning. And long before that, they said, goblin <
line 2451=>soldiers would be coming down  from  the mountains; and goblins can climb  trees, <
line 2452=>Now you can understand why Gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, <
line 2453=>fully afraid, wizard  though he was, and  to feel  that  they were  in <
line 2454=>d not yet escaped at all. All  the same he was not going to <
line 2455=>let them have it all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a <
line 2456=>h  wolves  all  round  on  the  ground  below.  He  gathered  the  huge <
line 2457=>ranches  of  his  tree.  Then  he  set  one  alight  with  bright  blue <
line 2458=>izzing down among  the circle of  the wolves.  It  struck one on <
line 2459=> shaggy coat caught  fire, and he was  leaping  to and <
line 2460=>fro  yelping  horribly.  Then  another  came  and  another,  one  in  blue  flames,  one  in <
line 2461=>red,  another  in  green.  They  burst  on  the  ground  in  the  middle  of  the  circle  and <
line 2462=>went off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf on <
line 2463=>eaped  in  the  air  ten  feet,  and  then  rushed  round  and  round  the <
line 2464=>apping even at the other wolves in his anger and fright. <
line 2465=>The  dwarves  and  Bilbo  shouted  and  cheered.  The  rage  of  the  wolves  was <
line 2466=> and  the  commotion  they  made  filled  all  the  forest.  Wolves  are  <
line 2467=> times, but this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a spark <
line 2468=>k and burned  into  them, and unless  they  rolled over quick <
line 2469=>they  were  soon  all  in  flames.  Very  soon  all  about  the  glade  wolves  were  rolling <
line 2470=>over  and over  to put out  the  sparks on  their backs, while  those  that  were burning <
line 2471=>were running about howling and setting others alight, till their own friends chased <
line 2472=>hey  fled  off  down  the  slopes  crying  and  yammering  and  looking <
line 2473=> all  this  uproar  in  the  forest  tonight?"  said  the  Lord  of  the  Eagles. He <
line 2474=>was  sitting,  black  in  the moonlight,  on  the  top  of  a  lonely  pinnacle  of  rock  at  the <
line 2475=><
line 2476=>####-eastern edge of  the mountains. "I hear wolves' voices! Are  the goblins at mischief <
line 2477=>in the woods?" <
line 2478=>, and  immediately  two of his guards  from the rocks at <
line 2479=>either hand  leaped up  to  follow him. They circled up  in  the sky and  looked down <
line 2480=>  of  the Wargs,  a  tiny  spot  far  far  below.  But  eagles  have  keen  eyes <
line 2481=>and  can  see  small  things  at  a  great  distance.  The  lord  of  the  eagles  of  the  Misty <
line 2482=>Mountains had eyes  that could  look at  the  sun unblinking, and could  see a  rabbit <
line 2483=>d a mile below even in the moonlight. So though he could not <
line 2484=>see  the  people  in  the  trees,  he  could make  out  the  commotion  among  the wolves <
line 2485=>and  see  the  tiny  flashes  of  fire,  and  hear  the  howling  and  yelping  come  up  faint <

line 2493=>they  swooped on  them and drove  them  shrieking back  to  their caves, and  stopped <

line 2511=>Some  of  them  actually  sat  down  and  laughed.  Others  waved  their  spears  and <
line 2512=><
line 2513=>####-clashed  the  shafts  against  their  shields.  Goblins  are  not  afraid  of  fire,  and  they <

line 2516=>round  the  tree-trunks.  Others  rushed  round  and  stamped  and  beat,  and  beat  and <
line 2517=>stamped,  until  nearly  all  the  flames were  put  out-but  they did not put out  the  fire <
line 2518=>nearest  to  the  trees  where  the  dwarves  were.  That  fire  they  fed  with  leaves  and <

line 2564=> <
line 2565=>There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord <

line 2569=>flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark <
line 2570=>rush of  their beating wings  smote  them  to  the  floor or drove  them  far  away;  their <
line 2571=>talons  tore  at  goblin  faces.  Other  birds  flew  to  the  tree-tops  and  seized  the <

line 2573=>Poor  little Bilbo was  very  nearly  left  behind  again! He  just managed  to  catch <

line 2587=>ite a little cliff; and he had never liked ladders, let alone <
line 2588=>trees  (never  having  had  to  escape  from wolves  before).  So  you  can  imagine  how <
line 2589=>his head swam now, when he  looked down between his dangling  toes and saw  the <
line 2590=>ide underneath him,  touched here and there with the light of <
line 2591=>the moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the plains. <
line 2592=>The  pale  peaks  of  the mountains were  coming  nearer, moonlit  spikes  of  rock <
line 2593=>black  shadows.  Summer  or  not,  it  seemed  very  cold.  He  shut  his <
line 2594=> he could hold on any longer. Then he imagined what would <
line 2595=>happen  if he did not. He  felt  sick. The  flight  ended only  just  in  time  for him,  just <
line 2596=>before  his  arms  gave  way.  He  loosed  Dori's  ankles  with  a  gasp  and  fell  onto  the <
line 2597=>rough  platform  of  an  eagle's  eyrie.  There  he  lay  without  speaking,  and  his <
line 2598=>thoughts were  a mixture  of  surprise  at  being  saved  from  the  fire,  and  fear  lest  he <
line 2599=>fell off that narrow place into the deep shadows on either side. He was feeling very <
line 2600=>ad by this time after the dreadful adventures of the last three <
line 2601=>t, and he found himself saying aloud: "Now I know <
line 2602=>what a piece of bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out of the pan on a fork <
line 2603=>lf!" <
line 2604=>rd  Dori  answering,  "because  the  bacon  knows  that  it <
line 2605=>will get back in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped we shan't. Also eagles <
line 2606=>aren't forks!" <
line 2607=> storks-forks,  I mean,"  said Bilbo  sitting up  and  looking <
line 2608=>anxiously  at  the  eagle  who  was  perched  close  by.  He  wondered  what  other <
line 2609=>nonsense he had been  saying, and  if  the eagle would  think  it  rude. You ought not <
line 2610=>n  eagle, when  you  are  only  the  size  of  a  hobbit,  and  are  up  in  his <

line 2614=>  flew  up.  "The  Lord  of  the  Eagles  bids  you  to  bring  your <
line 2615=>lf," he cried and was off again. The other seized Dori in <
line 2616=>his  claws  and  flew  away  with  him  into  the  night  leaving Bilbo  all  alone. He  had <
line 2617=>just strength  to wonder what  the messenger had meant by  'prisoners,' and  to begin <
line 2618=>eing  torn  up  for  supper  like  a  rabbit,  when  his  own  turn  came.  The <
line 2619=>, seized him in his talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off. <
line 2620=>  a  short  way.  Very  soon  Bilbo  was  laid  down,  trembling <
line 2621=> shelf  of  rock  on  the mountain-side. There was no path down <
line 2622=> path down off it except by jumping over a precipice. <
line 2623=>There  he  found  all  the  others  sitting  with  their  backs  to  the  mountain  wall.  The <
line 2624=>Lord of the Eagles also was there and was speaking to Gandalf. <
line 2625=>It  seemed  that  Bilbo  was  not  going  to  be  eaten  after  all.  The  wizard  and  the <
line 2626=>eagle-lord  appeared  to  know  one  another  slightly,  and  even  to  be  on  friendly <
line 2627=> of fact Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had once <
line 2628=>eagles  and  healed  their  lord  from  an  arrow-wound. So <
line 2629=>you  see  'prisoners'  had  meant  'prisoners  rescued  from  the  goblins'  only,  and  not <
line 2630=>captives  of  the  eagles. As Bilbo  listened  to  the  talk  of Gandalf  he  realized  that  at <
line 2631=>last  they  were  going  to  escape  really  and  truly  from  the  dreadful  mountains.  He <
line 2632=>was  discussing  plans  with  the  Great  Eagle  for  carrying  the  dwarves  and  himself <
line 2633=>and Bilbo far away and setting  them down well on  their  journey across  the plains <

line 2646=>d  all  the  preparations.  Bilbo  was  too  weak  to  help, <
line 2647=>and  anyway  he was  not much  good  at  skinning  rabbits  or  cutting  up meat,  being <
line 2648=>used  to  having  it  delivered  by  the  butcher  all  ready  to  cook.  Gandalf,  too,  was <
line 2649=>lying  down  after  doing  his  part  in  setting  the  fire  going,  since Oin  and Gloin  had <
line 2650=>lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never taken to matches even yet.) <

line 2652=>feeling full and  comfortable  again,  and he  felt he  could  sleep  contentedly,  though <
line 2653=>really  he  would  have  liked  a  loaf  and  butter  better  than  bits  of  meat  toasted  on <
line 2654=>sticks. He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than ever he had done on <

line 2669=>farewells  and  promising  to  repay  the  lord  of  the  eagles  if  ever  they  could,  as  off <
line 2670=>rose  fifteen  great  birds  from  the  mountain's  side.  The  sun  was  still  close  to  the <
line 2671=>eastern  edge  of  things.  The morning was  cool,  and mists were  in  the  valleys  and <

line 2676=>"Don't pinch!" said his eagle. "You need not be frightened like a rabbit, even if <
line 2677=>r  like  one.  It  is  a  fair morning  with  little  wind. What  is  finer  than <
line 2678=>flying?" <
line 2679=>Bilbo  would  have  liked  to  say:  "A  warm  bath  and  late  breakfast  on  the  lawn <
line 2680=>afterwards;"  but  he  thought  it  better  to  say  nothing  at  all,  and  to  let  go  his  clutch <
line 2681=>just a tiny bit. <
line 2682=>ile  the  eagles must have  seen  the point  they were making  for, <
line 2683=>height,  for  they  began  to  go  down  circling  round  in  great <
line 2684=>a long while, and at last the hobbit opened his eyes again. <
line 2685=>The earth was much nearer, and below  them were  trees  that  looked  like oaks and <
line 2686=>elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But cropping out of <
line 2687=>0path of the stream which looped itself about it, was a great <
line 2688=>rock, almost a hill of stone,  like a  last outpost of  the distant mountains, or a huge <
line 2689=>piece cast miles into the plain by some giant among giants. <
line 2690=>Quickly  now  to  the  top  of  this  rock  the  eagles  swooped  one  by  one  and  set <

line 2695=>walks," answered Gandalf, who knew the correct reply.  <
line 2696=>And so they parted. And though the lord of the eagles became in after days the <
line 2697=>d  wore  a  golden  crown,  and  his  fifteen  chieftains  golden <
line 2698=>  that  the  dwarves  gave  them),  Bilbo  never  saw  them <

line 2700=>the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now.  <
line 2701=>There was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with <
line 2702=>0t to the river, across which a ford of huge flat stones led <
line 2703=>to  the  grass-land  beyond  the  stream.  There  was  a  little  cave  (a  wholesome  one <

line 2710=>meanwhile I have some other pressing business to attend to." <
line 2711=>The  dwarves  groaned  and  looked  most  distressed,  and  Bilbo wept.  They  had <

line 2713=>to  help  them  out  of  difficulties.  "I  am  not  going  to  disappear  this  very  instant," <
line 2714=>said  he.  "I  can  give  you  a  day  or  two more.  Probably  I  can  help  you  out of your <

line 2718=>we  had  not  left  the mountain  pass  in  a  hurry.  Very  few people  live  in  these parts, <
line 2719=>unless  they  have  come  here  since  I was  last  down  this way, which  is  some  years <
line 2720=>ago.  But  there  is  somebody  that  I  know  of,  who  lives  not  far  away.  That <

line 2722=>e Carrock I believe he calls it. He does not come here <
line 2723=>often,  certainly  not  in  the  daytime,  and  it  is  no  good  waiting  for  him.  In  fact  it <
line 2724=>would  be  very  dangerous. We  must  go  and  find  him;  and  if  all  goes  well  at  our <
line 2725=>meeting,  I  think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles  'farewell wherever you <
line 2726=>fare!' " <

line 2731=> dragon-gold - when you have got it." topped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed in <

line 2733=>in the sun, which was now strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still sore and a <

line 2984=>Beside  them  a  pony  pushed  two  low-seated  benches  with  wide  rush-bottoms and <

line 2998=>dangerous wood,  that  lay  outstretched  far  to North  and  South  a  day's  ride  before <
line 2999=>them, barring their way to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood. <
line 3000=>The  dwarves  listened  and  shook  their  beards,  for  they  knew  that  they  must <

line 3002=>perils  they  had  to  pass  before  they  came  to  the  dragon's  stronghold. When  dinner <
line 3003=>was  over  they  began  to  tell  tales  of  their  own,  but  Beorn  seemed  to  be  growing <
line 3004=>drowsy  and  paid  little  heed  to  them.  They  spoke  most  of  gold  and  silver  and <

line 3052=>raised  platform  between  the  pillars  and  the  outer  wall.  For  him  there was  a  little <
line 3053=>en  blankets.  He  snuggled  into  them  very  gladly, <
line 3054=>summertime though it was. The fire burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in the night <
line 3055=>d now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf were all <
line 3056=>asleep,  to  judge  by  their  breathing;  a  splash  of  white  on  the  floor  came  from  the <
line 3057=>high moon, which was peering down through the smoke-hole in the roof. <

line 3060=>in enchanted shape, and if he would come in as a bear and kill them. <
line 3061=>He  dived  under  the  blankets  and  hid  his  head,  and  fell  asleep  again  at  last  in <
line 3062=>spite of his fears. <
line 3063=>It was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in <
line 3064=>ad rolled down with a bump from the platform on <
line 3065=>  It was Bofur,  and he was grumbling  about  it, when Bilbo opened his <
line 3066=>s," he said, "or there will be no breakfast left for you." <
line 3067=>Up jumped Bilbo. "Breakfast!" he cried. "Where is breakfast?" <
line 3068=>"Mostly  inside us,"  answered  the other dwarves who were moving  around  the <
line 3069=>ft is out on the veranda. We have been about looking for Beorn <
line 3070=>ever  since  the  sun got up; but  there  is no  sign of him anywhere,  though we  found <

line 3073=>as he could. <
line 3074=>"O!  out  and  about  somewhere,"  they  told  him.  But  he  saw  no  sign  of  the <
line 3075=>wizard  all  that  day  until  the  evening.  Just  before  sunset  he  walked  into  the  hall, <
line 3076=>where  the  hobbit  and  the  dwarves  were  having  supper,  waited  on  by  Beorn's <
line 3077=>0s,  as  they  had  been  all  day.  Of  Beorn  they  had  seen  and  heard <
line 3078=>ght before, and they were getting puzzled. <
line 3079=>and they were getting puzzled. and where have you been all day yourself?" they all cried. <
line 3080=>"One  question  at  a  time-and  none  till  after  supper!  I  haven't  had  a  bite  since <
line 3081=>breakfast." <
line 3082=>0  away  his  plate  and  jug  â€”  he  had  eaten  two  whole <
line 3083=>loaves  (with masses  of  butter  and  honey  and  clotted  cream)  and  drunk  at  least  a <
line 3084=>quart  of mead  and  he  took  out  his  pipe.  "I will  answer  the  second  question  first," <
line 3085=>he said, "-but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke rings!" Indeed for a long <
line 3086=>time they could get nothing more out of him, he was so busy sending smoke-rings <
line 3087=>rs  of  the  hall,  changing  them  into  all  sorts  of  different <
line 3088=>ting  them at  last chasing one another out of the hole in <
line 3089=>the roof. <
line 3090=>0ry queer  from outside, popping out  into  the  air one <
line 3091=>after another, green, blue, red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little ones; little <

line 3097=>there  were  little  bears,  large  bears,  ordinary  bears,  and <
line 3098=>ng outside from dark to nearly dawn. They came from <
line 3099=>almost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the Mountains. In <
line 3100=> one  set  of  footprints  led-none  coming,  only  ones  going  away <
line 3101=>0these  as  far  as  the  Carrock.  There  they  disappeared  into  the  river, <
line 3102=>as  too  deep  and  strong  beyond  the  rock  for me  to  cross.  It  is  easy <
line 3103=>remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the ford, but on <
line 3104=>ff  standing  up  from  a  swirling  channel.  I  had  to  walk miles <
line 3105=>0e  where  the  river  was  wide  and  shallow  enough  for  me  to <
line 3106=> miles  back  again  to  pick  up  the  tracks  again.  By  that <
line 3107=> me  to  follow  them  far.  They  went  straight  off  in  the <
line 3108=>the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we had <
line 3109=>our  pleasant  little  party  with  the  Wargs  the  night  before  last.  And  now  I  think  I <
line 3110=>have  answered  your  first  question,  too,"  ended  Gandalf,  and  he  sat  a  long  while <
line 3111=>silent. <
line 3112=>Bilbo  thought  he  knew what  the wizard meant.  "What  shall we  do,"  he  cried, <
line 3113=>"if  he  leads  all  the Wargs  and  the  goblins  down  here? We  shall  all  be  caught  and <
line 3114=>killed! I thought you said he was not 9 friend of theirs." <
line 3115=>'t be silly! You had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy." <
line 3116=>The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go <

line 3118=>e head about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black <
line 3119=>ances  round  and  round  in  the  moonlight  in  the <
line 3120=>courtyard.  Then  he  woke  up  when  everyone  else  was  asleep,  and  he  heard  the <
line 3121=> scuffling,  snuffling,  and  growling  as  before.  Next  morning  they <

line 3123=>re still!" he said. He picked up the hobbit and laughed: "Not <
line 3124=>eaten  up  by  Wargs  or  goblins  or  wicked  bears  yet  I  see";  and  he  poked  Mr. <
line 3125=>Baggins' waistcoat most disrespectfully. "Little bunny is getting nice and fat again <
line 3126=>0y," he chuckled. "Come and have some more!" <
line 3127=>kled. "Come and have some more!" nt  to  breakfast  with  him.  Beorn  was  most  jolly  for  a  change; <
line 3128=> be  in  a  splendidly  good  humour  and  set  them  all  laughing <
line 3129=>s; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or why <
line 3130=>he  was  so  nice  to  them,  for he  told  them himself. He had been over  the  river  and <
line 3131=>right  back  up  into  the  mountains-from  which  you  can  guess  that  he  could  travel <
line 3132=>quickly,  in bear's  shape  at  any  rate. From  the burnt wolf-glade he had soon found <
line 3133=>  of  their  story  was  true;  but  he  had  found  more  than  that:  he  had <
line 3134=>nd a goblin wandering in the woods. From these he had got news: <
line 3135=>ll  hunting  with  Wargs  for  the  dwarves,  and  they  were <
line 3136=>fiercely  angry  because  of  the  death  of  the  Great  Goblin,  and  also  because  of  the <
line 3137=>burning of the chief wolf's nose and the death from the wizard's fire of many of his <
line 3138=>chief  servants. So much  they  told him when he  forced  them, but he guessed  there <
line 3139=>s  than  this  afoot,  and  that  a  great  raid  of  the  whole  goblin <
line 3140=>allies  into  the  lands  shadowed by  the mountains might  soon <
line 3141=>s,  or  to  take  vengeance  on  the men  and  creatures  that <
line 3142=>lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering them. <
line 3143=>"It was  a  good  story,  that of yours," said Beorn, "but I like it still better now I <
line 3144=>am sure it is true. You must forgive my not taking your word. If you lived near the <
line 3145=>would  take  the word of no one  that you did not know  as <
line 3146=>well  as  your  brother  or  better. As  it is, I can only say that I have hurried home as <
line 3147=>fast  as  I  could  to  see  that  you  were  safe,  and  to  offer  you  any  help  that  I  can.  I <
line 3148=>shall  think more  kindly  of  dwarves  after  this. Killed  the Great Goblin,  killed  the <
line 3149=>Great Goblin!" he chuckled fiercely to himself. <
line 3150=>th the goblin and the Warg?" asked Bilbo suddenly.  <
line 3151=>"Come  and  see!"  said  Beorn,  and  they  followed  round  the  house.  A  goblin's <
line 3152=>side  the  gate  and  a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. <
line 3153=>y.  But  now  he  was  their  friend,  and  Gandalf  thought  it <
line 3154=>ole  story  and  the  reason  of  their  journey,  so  that  they <
line 3155=>uld offer.  <
line 3156=>mised to do for them. He would provide ponies for each of <
line 3157=>them,  and  a  horse  for Gandalf,  for  their  journey  to  the  forest,  and  he would  lade <
line 3158=>them with food to last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as easy as <
line 3159=>0-nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of <
line 3160=>cakes that would keep good a long time, and on a little of <
line 3161=>which they could march far. The making of these was one of his secrets; but honey <
line 3162=>0n most of his foods, and they were good to eat, though they made <
line 3163=>they would not need to carry this side of the forest, for <
line 3164=>there were streams and springs along  the road. "But your way  through Mirkwood <
line 3165=>  and  difficult,"  he  said.  "Water  is  not  easy  to  find  there,  nor <
line 3166=>ime  is  not  yet  come  for  nuts  (though  it may  be  past  and  gone  indeed <
line 3167=>before  you  get  to  the  other  side),  and  nuts  are  about  all  that  grows  there  fit  for <
line 3168=>food;  in  there  the wild  things are dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with <
line 3169=>0ing water,  and  I will give you  some bows  and  arrows. But  I doubt <
line 3170=>ng you find in Mirkwood will be wholesome to eat or to <
line 3171=>drink. There is one stream there, I know, black and strong which crosses the path. <
line 3172=>either  drink  of,  nor  bathe  in;  for  I  have  heard  that  it  carries <
line 3173=>reat drowsiness and forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of <
line 3174=>that  place  I  don't  think  you  will  shoot  anything,  wholesome  or  unwholesome, <
line 3175=>without straying from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any reason. "That is <
line 3176=>give  you.  Beyond  the  edge  of  the  forest  I  cannot  help  you <
line 3177=>n  your  luck  and  your  courage  and  the  food  I  send with <
line 3178=>I must ask you to send back my horse and my ponies. <
line 3179=>But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you come back this <
line 3180=>ed  him,  of  course,  with  many  bows  and  sweepings  of  their  hoods <
line 3181=>your service, O master of the wide wooden halls!" But their <
line 3182=>spirits  sank  at  his  grave  words,  and  they  all  felt  that  the  adventure  was  far more <
line 3183=>dangerous  than  they  had  thought,  while  all  the  time,  even  if  they  passed  all  the <
line 3184=>perils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end. <
line 3185=>All that morning they were busy with preparations. Soon after midday they ate <
line 3186=>t  time,  and  after  the  meal  they  mounted  the  steeds  he  was <
line 3187=> him many  farewells  they  rode off  through his gate at a <
line 3188=>good pace. <
line 3189=> his high hedges at  the east of his  fenced lands they turned <
line 3190=>north  and  then  bore  to  the  north-west. By his  advice  they were no  longer making <
line 3191=>for  the main  forest-road to the south of his land. Had they followed the pass, their <
line 3192=>path  would  have  led  them  down  the  stream  from  the  mountains  that  joined  the <
line 3193=>south  of  the Carrock. At  that  point  there was  a  deep  ford which <
line 3194=>  if  they had  still had  their ponies, and beyond  that a  track <
line 3195=> wood and  to  the entrance of  the old  forest  road. But Beorn <
line 3196=> way  was  now  often  used  by  the  goblins,  while  the <
line 3197=>forest-road itself, he bad heard, was overgrown and disused at the eastern end and <
line 3198=>ble marshes where  the paths had  long been  lost.  Its eastern opening <
line 3199=>r to the south of the Lonely Mountain, and would have left <
line 3200=>them  still  with  a  long  and  difficult  northward  march  when  they  got  to  the  other <
line 3201=>side. <
line 3202=>the  edge  of Mirkwood  drew  closer  to  the  borders  of  the <
line 3203=>e Mountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised <
line 3204=>is way; for at a place a few days' ride due north of the Carrock was <
line 3205=>nown  pathway  through  Mirkwood  that  led  almost  straight <
line 3206=>towards the Lonely Mountain. <
line 3207=>"The  goblins,"  Beorn  had  said,  "will  not  dare  to  cross  the  Great  River  for  a <
line 3208=>hundred  miles  north  of  the  Carrock  nor  to  come  near  my  house  â€“  it  is  well <
line 3209=>protected  at  night!â€“  but  I  should  ride  fast;  for  if  they  make  their  raid  soon  they <
line 3210=>will cross the river to the south  and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you <
line 3211=>off,  and  Wargs  run  swifter  than  ponies.  Still  you  are  safer  going  north,  even <
line 3212=>to be going back nearer to their strongholds; for that is what they <
line 3213=>they  will  have  the  longer  ride  to  catch  you.  Be  off  now  as <
line 3214=>  is  why  they  were  now  riding  in  silence,  galloping  wherever  the  ground <
line 3215=>was grassy and  smooth, with  the mountains dark on  their  left, and  in  the distance <
line 3216=>er with its trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just turned <
line 3217=> and  till  evening  it  lay  golden  on  the  land  about  them.  It <
line 3218=>0  of  pursuing  goblins  behind,  and  when  they  had  put  many <
line 3219=>s house they began to talk and to sing again and to <
line 3220=>forget  the  dark  forest-path  that  lay  in  front.  But  in  the  evening  when  the  dusk <
line 3221=>came on and  the peaks of  the mountains glowered against  the  sunset  they made a <
line 3222=>nd most of them slept uneasily with dreams in which there <
line 3223=>came  the  howl  of  hunting wolves  and  the  cries  of  goblins.  Still  the  next morning <
line 3224=>dawned bright and fair again. <
line 3225=>There  was  an  autumn-like mist  white  upon  the  ground  and  the  air  was  chill, <
line 3226=>sun  rose  red  in  the  East  and  the  mists  vanished,  and  while  the <
line 3227=>ong they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, <
line 3228=>and all  the while  they saw nothing save grass and  flowers and birds and scattered <
line 3229=>trees,  and  occasionally  small  herds  of  red  deer  browsing  or  sitting  at noon  in  the <
line 3230=>shade.  Sometimes  Bilbo  saw  the  horns  of  the  harts  sticking  up  out  of  the  long <
line 3231=>grass,  and  at  first  he  thought  they  were  the  dead  branches  of  trees.  That  third <
line 3232=>ere so eager  to press on,  for Beorn had said  that  they should  reach <
line 3233=>y  on  the  fourth  day,  that  they  rode  still  forward  after  dusk  and <
line 3234=>neath  the moon. As  the  light faded Bilbo  thought he saw away  to <
line 3235=>left,  the  shadowy  form  of  a  great  bear  prowling  along  in  the <
line 3236=>if  he  dared  to  mention  it  to  Gandalf,  the  wizard  only  said: <
line 3237=><
line 3238=>ore dawn, though their night had been short. As soon <
line 3239=>as it was light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or waiting <
line 3240=>ack and  frowning wall before  them. The  land began  to  slope up <
line 3241=>o  the  hobbit  that  a  silence  began  to  draw  in  upon  them. <
line 3242=>.  There  were  no  more  deer;  not  even  rabbits  were  to  be <
line 3243=> had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and were resting <
line 3244=>almost beneath  the great overhanging boughs of  its outer  trees. Their  trunks were <
line 3245=>  their  branches  twisted,  their  leaves  were  dark  and  long.  Ivy <
line 3246=>d along the ground. <
line 3247=>"Well,  here  is  Mirkwood!"  said  Gandalf.  "The  greatest  of  the  forests  of  the <
line 3248=>I  hope  you  like  the  look  of  it.  Now  you  must  send  back  these <

line 3250=>ere  inclined  to  grumble  at  this,  but  the  wizard  told  them  they <
line 3251=>is not as  far off as you seem  to  think, and you had better keep <
line 3252=>he  is  a bad  enemy. Mr. Baggins'  eyes  are  sharper  than <
line 3253=>yours,  if you have not seen each night after dark a great bear going along with us <
line 3254=>or sitting far of in the moon watching our camps. Not only to guard you and guide <
line 3255=> the ponies too. Beorn may be your friend, but he loves <
line 3256=>his animals as his children. You do not guess what kindness he has  shown you  in <
line 3257=> them so far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if you <
line 3258=>tried to take them into the forest." <
line 3259=>to take them into the forest."  then?"  said  Thorin.  "You  don't  mention  sending  that <
line 3260=>back." <
line 3261=>sending it." <
line 3262=>romise then?" <
line 3263=>0r that. I am not sending the horse back, I am riding it!" <
line 3264=>Then  they  knew  that  Gandalf  was  going  to  leave  them  at  the  very  edge  of <
line 3265=>Mirkwood, and they were in despair.  <
line 3266=>in despair.  ing they could say would change his mind. <
line 3267=>out before, when we landed on the Carrock," he said. "It <
line 3268=>is no use arguing. I have, as I  told you, some pressing business away south; and I <
line 3269=>0hrough bothering with you people. We may meet again before all <
line 3270=>is  over,  and  then  again of  course we may not. That depends on your  luck  and on <
line 3271=>0age and  sense; and  I am  sending Mr. Baggins with you.  I have  told you <
line 3272=>before  that  he  has  more  about  him  than  you  guess,  and  you  will  find  that  out <
line 3273=>before  long.  So  cheer  up  Bilbo  and  don't  look  so  glum.  Cheer  up  Thorin  and <
line 3274=>  expedition  after  all. Think  of  the  treasure  at  the  end,  and <
line 3275=>forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow morning!" <
line 3276=>rning came he still said the same. <
line 3277=>ng came he still said the same.   left  to  do  but  to  fill  their  water-skins  at  a  clear <
line 3278=>forest-gate, and unpack the ponies. They distributed <
line 3279=>ges  as  fairly  as  they  could,  though  Bilbo  thought  his  lot  was <
line 3280=> did not at all like  the idea of trudging for miles and miles <
line 3281=>with all that on his back. <
line 3282=>"Don't you worry!" said Thorin. "It will get  lighter all  too soon. Before  long  I <
line 3283=>expect we shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food begins to run short." <
line 3284=>ood-bye  to  their  ponies  and  turned  their  heads  for <
line 3285=>home.  Off  they  trotted  gaily,  seeming  very  glad  to  put  their  tails  towards  the <
line 3286=>shadow of Mirkwood. As they went away Bilbo could have sworn that a thing like <
line 3287=>a bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after them. <
line 3288=>Now Gandalf  too  said  farewell. Bilbo  sat on  the ground  feeling very unhappy <
line 3289=>the wizard on his tall horse. He had gone just inside the <
line 3290=>forest  after  breakfast  (a  very  poor  one),  and  it  had  seemed  as  dark  in  there  in  the <
line 3291=>morning  as  at  night,  and  very  secret:  "a  sort  of watching  and waiting  feeling,"  he <
line 3292=>said to himself. <
line 3293=>"Good-bye!"  said  Gandalf  to  Thorin.  "And  good-bye  to  you  all,  good-bye! <
line 3294=> is your way now. Don't stray off the track!-if you do, it <
line 3295=>is  a  thousand  to one you will never  find  it  again  and never get out of Mirkwood; <
line 3296=>don't suppose I, or any one else, will ever see you again." <
line 3297=>"Do we really have to go through?" groaned the hobbit. <
line 3298=>"Yes, you do!" said the wizard, "if  you want to get to the other side. You must <
line 3299=>0 up your quest. And I am not going to allow you to back <
line 3300=>out  now,  Mr.  Baggins.  I  am  ashamed  of  you  for  thinking  of  it.  You  have  got  to <
line 3301=>er all these dwarves for me," he laughed. <
line 3302=>e dwarves for me," he laughed.  "I didn't mean that. I meant, is there no way round?" <
line 3303=>"There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and <
line 3304=>t  you  wouldn't  get  a  safe  path  even  then.  There  are  no  safe <
line 3305=>paths  in  this part of  the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, <
line 3306=>and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before you could get round Mirkwood <
line 3307=>you  would  be  right  among  the  slopes  of  the  Grey  Mountains,  and <
line 3308=>iff  with  goblins,  hobgoblins,  and  rest  of  the  worst  description. <

line 3313=>tower! Stick  to  the  forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the best, and with a <
line 3314=>endous  slice  of  luck  you  may  come  out  one  day  and  see  the  Long  Marshes <
line 3315=>lying  below  you,  and  beyond  them,  high  in  the East,  the Lonely Mountain where <

line 3317=>"Very  comforting  you  are  to  be  sure,"  growled  Thorin.  "Good-bye!  If  you <
line 3318=>ter get off without any more talk!" <
line 3319=>et off without any more talk!" ly  good-bye!"  said  Gandalf,  and  he  turned  his  horse <
line 3320=>and  rode  down  into  the West.  But  he  could  not  resist  the  temptation  to  have  the <
line 3321=> word. Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to <
line 3322=>his mouth  and  called  to  them. They  heard  his  voice  come  faintly:  "Good-bye! Be <
line 3323=>good, take care of yourselves-and DON'T LEAVE THE PATH!" <
line 3324=>Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. "O good-bye and go away!" <
line 3325=>dwarves,  all  the  more  angry  because  they  were  really  filled  with <
line 3326=>. Now began the most dangerous part of all the journey.  <
line 3327=>each  shouldered  the  heavy  pack  and  the  water-skin  which  was  their <
line 3328=>rom the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the <
line 3329=>8 </h4> <br><
line 3330=><
line 3331=>le.  The  entrance  to  the  path  was  like  a  sort  of  arch <
line 3332=>leading  into  a  gloomy  tunnel made  by  two  great  trees  that  leant  together,  too  old <
line 3333=>and  strangled  with  ivy  and  hung  with  lichen  to  bear  more  than  a  few  blackened <
line 3334=>aves. The  path  itself was  narrow and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon <
line 3335=>the  light  at  the  gate  was  like  a  little  bright  hole  far  behind,  and  the  quiet  was  so <
line 3336=>deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and <
line 3337=>listened. As  theft  eyes  became  used  to  the  dimness  they  could  see  a  little way  to <
line 3338=>  sort  of  darkened  green  glimmer.  Occasionally  a  slender  beam  of <
line 3339=>sun  that had  the  luck  to slip  in  through some opening  in  the  leaves far above, and <
line 3340=>still  more  luck  in  not  being  caught  in  the  tangled  boughs  and  matted  twigs <
line 3341=>and  bright  before  them.  But  this  was  seldom,  and  it <
line 3342=>soon ceased altogether.  <
line 3343=>There were  black  squirrels  in  the wood. As  Bilbo's  sharp  inquisitive  eyes  got <
line 3344=>  things  he  could  catch  glimpses  of  them whisking  off  the  path  and <
line 3345=> tree-trunks.  There  were  queer  noises  too,  grunts,  scufflings,  and <
line 3346=>hurryings  in  the undergrowth, and among  the  leaves  that  lay piled endlessly  thick <
line 3347=>t-floor;  but  what  made  the  noises  he  could  not  see.  The <
line 3348=>nastiest  things  they  saw  were  the  cobwebs:  dark  dense  cobwebs  with  threads <
line 3349=>extraordinarily  thick,  often  stretched  from  tree  to  tree,  or  tangled  in  the  lower <
line 3350=>s  on  either  side  of  them.  There  were  none  stretched  across  the  path,  but <
line 3351=>whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason they could not <
line 3352=>guess. <
line 3353=>It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated <
line 3354=>the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. But <
line 3355=>had to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the <
line 3356=>sky, and  longed for  the feel of wind on  their faces. There was no movement of air <
line 3357=>of, and it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. Even <
line 3358=>the dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles <
line 3359=>light of the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but <
line 3360=>not to spend summer days in, felt he was being slowly suffocated. <
line 3361=> worst. It then became pitch-dark â€“ not what you call pitch-<
line 3362=>dark,  but  really  pitch;  so  black  that  you  really  could  see  nothing.  Bilbo  tried <
line 3363=>flapping his hand in front of his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well, perhaps it <
line 3364=><
line 3365=>####-is  not  true  to  say  that  they  could  see  nothing:  they  could  see  eyes. They  slept  all <
line 3366=>d  took  it  in  turns  to  watch;  and  when  it  was  Bilbo's <
line 3367=>turn  he  would  see  gleams  in  the  darkness  round  them,  and  sometimes  pairs  of <
line 3368=>w  or  red  or  green  eyes  would  stare  at  him  from  a  little  distance,  and  then <
line 3369=>slowly  fade  and  disappear  and  slowly  shine  out  again  in  another  place.  And <
line 3370=>sometimes  they  would  gleam  down  from  the  branches  just  above  him;  and  that <
line 3371=>But the eyes that he liked the least were horrible pale bulbous <
line 3372=>sort  of  eyes.  "Insect  eyes"  he  thought,  "not  animal  eyes,  only  they  are  much  too <
line 3373=>et  very  cold,  they  tried  lighting watch-fires at night, but <
line 3374=>they  soon  gave  that  up.  It  seemed  to  bring  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  eyes  all <
line 3375=>round  them,  though  the  creatures,  whatever  they  were,  were  careful  never  to  let <
line 3376=> bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it brought thousands <
line 3377=>of  dark-grey  and  black  moths,  some  nearly  as  big  as  your  hand,  flapping  and <
line 3378=>whirring  round their ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge bats, black as a <

line 3380=>is  went  on  for  what  seemed  to  the  hobbit  ages  upon  ages;  and  he  was <
line 3381=>y,  for  they were extremely careful with  their provisions. Even  so, as <
line 3382=>days  followed  days,  and  still  the  forest  seemed  just  the  same,  they  began  to  get <
line 3383=>anxious. The  food would not  last  for  ever:  it was  in  fact  already beginning  to get <
line 3384=>low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and they wasted many arrows before they <
line 3385=>managed  to  bring  one  down  on  the  path.  But  when  they  roasted  it,  it  proved <
line 3386=>horrible to taste, and they shot no more squirrels. <
line 3387=>They  were  thirsty  too,  for  they  had  none  too  much  water,  and  in  all  the  time <
line 3388=>  spring  nor  stream.  This  was  their  state  when  one  day  they <
line 3389=>0by a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not very <
line 3390=> right across  the way, and  it was black, or  looked  it  in  the gloom. It was well <
line 3391=>that  Beorn  had  warned  them  against  it,  or  they  would  have  drunk  from  it, <
line 3392=>whatever  its  colour,  and  filled  some  of  their  emptied  skins  at  its  bank. As  it was <
line 3393=>they only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its water. There <
line 3394=>od  across,  but  it  had  rotted  and  fallen  leaving  only  the <
line 3395=>broken posts near the bank. <
line 3396=> peering forward cried: "There is a boat against <
line 3397=>the far bank! Now why couldn't it have been this side!" <
line 3398=>think it is?" asked Thorin, for by now they knew Bilbo <
line 3399=>had the sharpest eyes among them. <
line 3400=> them. -"Not at all far. I shouldn't think above twelve yards." <
line 3401=>"Twelve  yards!  I  should  have  thought  it was  thirty  at  least,  but my  eyes  don't <
line 3402=>see  as  well  as  they  used  a  hundred  years  ago.  Still  twelve  yards  is  as  good  as  a <
line 3403=>mile. We can't jump it, and we daren't try to wade or swim." <
line 3404=>"Can any of you throw a rope?" <
line 3405=>"What's the good of that? The boat is sure to be tied up, even if we could hook <
line 3406=>it, which I doubt." <
line 3407=>"I  don't  believe  it  is  tied,"  said Bilbo,  "though of  course  I  can't be  sure  in  this <
line 3408=>light;  but  it  looks  to me  as  if  it was  just  drawn  up  on  the  bank, which  is  low  just <
line 3409=>there where the path goes down into the water." <
line 3410=>e strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still  has the best sight," said <
line 3411=>Thorin.  "Come  here  Fili,  and  see  if  you  can  see  the  boat  Mr.  Baggins  is  talking <
line 3412=>t he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the <
line 3413=>rought  him  a  rope.  They  had  several with  them, and on  the <
line 3414=>end  of  the  longest  they  fastened  one  of  the  large  iron  hooks  they  had  used  for <
line 3415=>  straps  about  their  shoulders. Fili  took  this  in his hand, <
line 3416=>balanced it for a moment, and then flung it across the stream. <
line 3417=>ter!  "Not  far  enough!"  said  Bilbo  who  was  peering <
line 3418=>forward.  "A  couple  of  feet  and  you  would  have  dropped  it  on  to  the  boat.  Try <
line 3419=>again.  I don't  suppose  the magic  is  strong  enough  to hurt you,  if you  just  touch  a <
line 3420=>bit of wet rope." <
line 3421=>Fili  picked  up  the  hook when  he  had  drawn  it  back,  rather  doubtfully  all  the <
line 3422=> with greater strength. <
line 3423=>"Steady!" said Bilbo, "you have thrown it right into the wood on the other side <
line 3424=>now.  Draw  it  back  gently."  Fili  hauled  the  rope  back  slowly,  and  after  a  while <
line 3425=> It is lying on the boat; let's hope the hook will catch." <
line 3426=>It  did.  The  rope went  taut,  and  Fili  pulled  in  vain. Kili  came  to  his  help,  and <
line 3427=>then  Oin  and  Gloin.  They  tugged  and  tugged,  and  suddenly  they  all  fell  over  on <
line 3428=>their backs. Bilbo was on  the  lockout, however, caught  the rope, and with a piece <
line 3429=>0  off  the  little  black  boat  as  it  came  rushing  across  the  stream. <
line 3430=>"Help!"  he  shouted,  and Balin was  just  in  time  to  seize  the  boat  before  it  floated <
line 3431=>0ent. <
line 3432=>"It  was  tied  after  all,"  said  he,  looking  at  the  snapped  painter  that  was  still <
line 3433=>dangling  from  it.  "That  was  a  good  pull,  my  lads;  and  a  good  job  that  our  rope <
line 3434=>Who'll cross first?" asked Bilbo. <
line 3435=>'ll cross first?" asked Bilbo. nd  you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. That's <
line 3436=>as  many  as  the  boat  will  hold  at  a  time.  After  that  Kili  and  Oin  and  Gloin  and <
line 3437=>Don; next On and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur." <
line 3438=>"I'm  always  last  and  I  don't  like  it,"  said  Bombur.  "It's  somebody  else's  turn <
line 3439=>." <
line 3440=>at. As  you  are,  you must  be with  the  last  and  lightest <
line 3441=>boatload.  Don't  start  grumbling  against  orders,  or  something  bad  will  happen  to <
line 3442=>you." <
line 3443=>ow  are  you  going  to  push  the  boat  back  to  the  far <
line 3444=>bank?" asked the hobbit. <
line 3445=>"Give me  another  length  of  rope  and  another  hook,"  said  Fili,  and when  they <
line 3446=>dy, he cast  into  the darkness ahead and as high as he could  throw  it. <
line 3447=>ll down again,  they saw  that  it must have stuck in the branches. <
line 3448=>and one of you haul on  the rope  that  is stuck  in a  tree on <
line 3449=>the other  side. One of  the others must keep hold of  the hook we used  at  first,  and <
line 3450=>we  are  safe  on  the  other  side  he  can  hook  it  on,  and  you  can draw  the boat <
line 3451=>back." <
line 3452=>l  soon  on  the  far  bank  safe  across  the  enchanted <
line 3453=>stream.  Dwalin  had  just  scrambled  out  with  the  coiled  rope  on  his  arm,  and <
line 3454=>Bombur  (still  grumbling)  was  getting  ready  to  follow,  when  something  bad  did <
line 3455=>happen. There was a  flying  sound of hooves on  the path ahead. Out of  the gloom <
line 3456=>flying deer.  It charged  into  the dwarves and bowled <
line 3457=>them  over,  then  gathered  itself  for  a  leap.  High  it  sprang  and  cleared  the  water <
line 3458=>with  a  mighty  jump.  But  it  did  not  reach  the  other  side  in  safety. Thorin was  the <
line 3459=>only  one  who  had  kept  his  feet  and  his  wits.  As  soon  as  they  had  landed  he  had <
line 3460=>bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat appeared. <
line 3461=>wift  and  sure  shot  into the leaping beast. As it reached the further <
line 3462=>bank  it  stumbled.  The  shadows  swallowed  it  up,  but  they  heard  the  sound  of <
line 3463=>n go still. <
line 3464=>Before  they  could  shout  in  praise  of  the  shot,  however,  a  dreadful  wail  from <
line 3465=>Bilbo  put  all  thoughts  of  venison  out  of  their  minds.  "Bombur  has  fallen  in! <
line 3466=>. It was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on <
line 3467=>the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had stumbled, <
line 3468=>m the bank, and then toppled back into the dark water, <
line 3469=>his  hands  slipping  off  the  slimy  roots  at  the  edge,  while  the  boat  span  slowly  off <
line 3470=>and disappeared. <
line 3471=>still  see  his  hood  above  the  water  when  they  ran  to  the  bank. <
line 3472=>Quickly  they  flung  a  rope with  a  hook towards him. His hand caught it, and they <
line 3473=>He  was  drenched  from  hair  to  boots,  of  course,  but  that <
line 3474=>was  not  the  worst.  When  they  laid  him  on  the  bank  he  was  already  fast  asleep, <
line 3475=>with one hand clutching the rope so tight that they could not get it from his grasp; <
line 3476=>and  fast asleep he  remained  in  spite of all  they could do. They were  still  standing <
line 3477=>over him,  cursing  their  ill  luck,  and Bombur's  clumsiness,  and  lamenting  the  loss <
line 3478=>of  the  boat  which  made  it  impossible  for  them  to  go  back  and  look  for  the  hart, <
line 3479=>me  aware of  the dim blowing of horns  in  the wood  and  the  sound <
line 3480=>0  off.  Then  they  all  fell  silent;  and  as  they  sat  it  seemed  they <
line 3481=>ise of a great hunt going by  to  the north of  the path, though they <
line 3482=>saw no sign of it. There they sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. <
line 3483=>ur  slept  on with  a  smile  on  his  fat  face,  as  if  he  no  longer  cared  for  all  the <
line 3484=>enly  on  the  path  ahead  appeared  some  white  deer,  a  hind  and  fawns  as <
line 3485=> as  the  hart  had  been  dark.  They  glimmered  in  the  shadows.  Before <
line 3486=>  out  three  of  the  dwarves  had  leaped  to  their  feet  and  loosed  off <
line 3487=>arrows  from  their  bows.  None  seemed  to  find  their  mark.  The  deer  turned  and <
line 3488=>es  as  silently  as  they  had  come,  and  in  vain  the  dwarves  shot <
line 3489=>their arrows after them. <
line 3490=>orin;  but  it  was  too  late,  the  excited  dwarves  had <
line 3491=>wasted  their  last  arrows,  and  now  the  bows  that  Beorn  had  given  them  were <
line 3492=>useless. <
line 3493=>They  were  a  gloomy  party  that  night,  and  the  gloom  gathered  still  deeper  on <
line 3494=> the following days. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond it <
line 3495=>the  path  seemed  to  straggle  on  just  as  before,  and  in  the  forest  they  could  see  no <
line 3496=>0 they  had  known  more  about  it  and  considered  the  meaning  of  the <
line 3497=>hunt  and  the  white  deer  that  had  appeared  upon  their  path,  they  would  have <
line 3498=>  last  drawing  towards  the  eastern  edge,  and  would  soon <
line 3499=>ave  kept  up  their  courage  and  their  hope,  to  thinner <
line 3500=>trees and places where the sunlight came again. <
line 3501=>not  know  this,  and  they  were  burdened  with  the  heavy  body  of <
line 3502=>ad  to  carry  along  with  them  as  best  they  could,  taking  the <
line 3503=>0s  of  four  each while  the  others  shared  their  packs.  If  these <
line 3504=>had not become all too light in the last few days, they would never have managed <
line 3505=>ut  a  slumbering  and  smiling  Bombur  was  a  poor  exchange  for  packs  filled <
line 3506=>with  food  however  heavy.  In  a  few  days  a  time  came when  there was  practically <
line 3507=>eft  to  eat  or  to  drink. Nothing wholesome  could  they  see  growing  in  the <
line 3508=>woods, only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant smell. <
line 3509=> four days from the enchanted stream they  came to a part where most of <
line 3510=> They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change, for <
line 3511=>here  there  was  no  undergrowth  and  the  shadow  was  not  so  deep.  There  was  a <
line 3512=>greenish light about them, and in places they could see some distance to either side <
line 3513=>t  the  light  only  showed  them  endless  lines  of  straight  grey  trunks <
line 3514=>like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a breath of air and a noise of <
line 3515=>d  sound.  A  few  leaves  came  rustling  down  to  remind  them <
line 3516=>ming  on.  Their  feet  ruffled  among  the  dead  leaves  of <
line 3517=>countless other  autumns  that drifted over  the banks of  the path  from  the deep  red <
line 3518=>carpets of the forest. <
line 3519=>lept  and  they grew very weary. At  times  they heard disquieting <
line 3520=> was  singing  in  the  distance  too.  The  laughter  was  the <
line 3521=>laughter of fair voices not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but it sounded <
line 3522=>eerie and  strange, and  they were not comforted,  rather  they hurried on  from  those <
line 3523=> strength they had left. <
line 3524=>Two  days  later  they  found  their  path  going  downwards  and  before  long  they <
line 3525=>were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks. <
line 3526=>e no end to this accursed forest?" said Thorin. <
line 3527=>"Somebody must climb a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and <
line 3528=>have  a  look  round.  The  only  way  is  to  choose  the  tallest  tree  that  overhangs  the <
line 3529=>ant Bilbo. They chose him because  to be of any use <
line 3530=>r  must  get  his  head  above  the  topmost  leaves,  and  so  he must  be  light <
line 3531=>enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him. Poor Mr. Baggins had <
line 3532=>never had much practice in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into the lowest <
line 3533=>es of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path, and up he had to go <
line 3534=>as best he could. He pushed his way through the tangled twigs with many a slap in <
line 3535=>the eye; he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs; more <
line 3536=>e  slipped  and  caught  himself  just  in  time; and at  last, after a dreadful <
line 3537=>struggle  in  a  difficult  place  where  there  seemed  to  be  no  convenient  branches  at <
line 3538=>all, he got near the top. All the time he was wondering whether there were spiders <
line 3539=> going to get down again (except by falling). <
line 3540=>own again (except by falling).  poked  his  head  above  the  roof  of  leaves,  and  then  he  found <
line 3541=>spiders  all  right.  But  they  were  only  small  ones  of  ordinary  size,  and  they  were <
line 3542=>after  the  butterflies.  Bilbo's  eyes  were  nearly  blinded  by  the  light.  He  could  hear <
line 3543=>ting up at him from far below, but he could not answer, only hold <
line 3544=>on  and  blink.  The  sun  was  shining  brilliantly,  and  it  was  a  long  while  before  he <
line 3545=>could  bear  it. When  he  could,  he  saw  all  round  him  a  sea  of  dark  green,  ruffled <
line 3546=>eze; and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I <
line 3547=>expect  they were a kind of  'purple emperor,' a butterfly  that  loves  the  tops of oak-<
line 3548=>t  these  were  not  purple  at  all,  they  were  a  dark  dark  velvety  black <
line 3549=>without any markings to be seen. <
line 3550=> to be seen. at  the  'black  emperors'  for  a  long  time,  and  enjoyed  the  feel  of  the <
line 3551=>breeze in his hair and on his face; but at length the cries of the dwarves, who were <
line 3552=>with  impatience  down  below,  reminded  him  of  his  real <
line 3553=>business.  It  was  no  good.  Gaze  as much  as  he might,  he  could  see  no  end  to  the <
line 3554=>es  and  the  leaves  in  any  direction.  His  heart,  that  had  been  lightened  by  the <
line 3555=>sight of the sun and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: there was no food <
line 3556=>to go back to down below.  <
line 3557=>ave told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest; and if <
line 3558=>Bilbo had had the sense to see it, the tree that he had climbed, though it was tall in <
line 3559=>itself, was standing near  the bottom of a wide valley, so  that  from  its  top  the  trees <
line 3560=>  to  swell  up  all  round  like  the  edges  of  a  great  bowl,  and  he  could  not <
line 3561=>expect  to  see  how  far  the  forest  lasted.  Still  he  did  not  see  this,  and  he  climbed <
line 3562=>down  full  of  despair.  He  got  to  the  bottom  again  at  last  scratched,  hot,  and <
line 3563=>miserable,  and  he  could  not  see  anything  in  the  gloom  below  when  he  got  there. <
line 3564=>His report soon made the others as miserable as he was. <
line 3565=> on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! Whatever shall <
line 3566=>f sending a hobbit!"  they cried, as if it was his fault. <
line 3567=>They did not care tuppence about the butterflies, and were only made more angry <
line 3568=> the beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to climb up <
line 3569=>and feel. <
line 3570=>e  their  very  last  scraps  and  crumbs  of  food;  and  next <
line 3571=> first  thing  they  noticed  was  that  they  were  still <
line 3572=>gnawingly  hungry,  and  the  next  thing  was  that  it  was  raining  and  that  here  and <
line 3573=>there  the  drip  of  it  was  dropping  heavily  on  the  forest  floor.  That  only  reminded <
line 3574=>them  that  they  were  also  parchingly  thirsty,  without  doing  anything  to  relieve <
line 3575=>them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting <
line 3576=>to  fall  on  your  tongue.  The  only  scrap  of  comfort  there  was, <
line 3577=>came unexpectedly from Bombur.  <
line 3578=>ectedly from Bombur.  denly  and  sat  up  scratching  his  head. He  could  not make  out <
line 3579=>where  he  was  at  all,  nor  why  he  felt  so  hungry;  for  he  had  forgotten  everything <
line 3580=>  they  started  their  journey  that  May  morning  long  ago. <
line 3581=>The  last  thing  that  he  remembered  was  the  party  at  the  hobbit's  house,  and  they <
line 3582=>had  great  difficulty  in  making  him  believe  their  tale  of  all  the  many  adventures <
line 3583=>0hey had had since. <
line 3584=>When he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt <
line 3585=> the  legs.  "Why  ever  did  I  wake  up!"  he  cried.  "I  was <
line 3586=>I dreamed I was walking in a forest rather like this <
line 3587=>one,  only  lit with  torches  on  the  trees  and  lamps  swinging  from  the  branches  and <
line 3588=>fires  burning  on  the  ground;  and  there  was  a  great  feast  going  on,  going  on  for <
line 3589=>ever.  A  woodland  king  was  there  with  a  crown  of  leaves,  and  there  was  a merry <
line 3590=>singing, and I could not count or describe the things there were to eat and drink." <
line 3591=>"You need not try," said Thorin. "In fact if you can't talk about something else, <
line 3592=>you  had  better  be  silent.  We  are  quite  annoyed  enough  with  you  as  it  is.  If  you <
line 3593=>hadn't waked up, we should have left you to your idiotic dreams in the forest; you <
line 3594=>are no joke to carry even after weeks of short commons." <
line 3595=>There  was  nothing  now  to  be  done  but  to  tighten  the  belts  round  their  empty <
line 3596=>  empty  sacks  and  packs,  and  trudge  along  the  track <
line 3597=>without any great hope of ever getting to the end before they lay down and died of <
line 3598=>starvation.  This  they  did  all  that  day,  going  very  slowly  and  wearily,  while <
line 3599=>Bombur  kept  on wailing  that  his  legs would  not  carry  him  and  that  he wanted  to <
line 3600=>lie down and sleep. <
line 3601=>"No you don't!" they said. "Let your legs take their share, we have carried you <
line 3602=>the same he suddenly refused  to go a step further and flung himself on  the <
line 3603=>ground.  "Go  on,  if  you  must,"  he  said.  "I'm  just  going  to  lie  here  and  sleep  and <
line 3604=>f I can't get it any other way. I hope I never wake up again." <
line 3605=>At that very moment Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: "What was <
line 3606=>saw a twinkle of light in the forest." <
line 3607=>inkle of light in the forest."  a  longish  way  off,  it  seemed,  they  saw  a  red  twinkle  in <
line 3608=>the dark; then another and another sprang out beside it. Even Bombur got up, and <
line 3609=>0ied along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The light was in front <
line 3610=>of them and to the left of the path, and when at last they had drawn level with it, it <
line 3611=>seemed  plain  that  torches  and  fires were  burning  under  the  trees, but a good way <
line 3612=>off their track. <
line 3613=><
line 3614=>####-"It  looks  as  if  my  dreams  were  coming  true,"  gasped  Bombur  puffing  up <
line 3615=>behind. He wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. But the others <
line 3616=>remembered  only  too  well  the  warnings  of  the  wizard  and  of  Beorn.  "A  feast <
line 3617=>uld be no good, if we never got back alive from it," said Thorin. <
line 3618=>"But  without  a  feast  we  shan't  remain  alive  much  longer  anyway,"  said <
line 3619=> Bilbo heartily agreed with him. They argued about it backwards and <
line 3620=>forwards for a long while, until they agreed at length to send out a couple of spies, <
line 3621=>creep  near  the  lights  and  find  out  more  about  them.  But  then  they  could  not <
line 3622=>agree  on  who  was  to  be  sent:  no  one  seemed  anxious  to  run  the  chance  of  being <
line 3623=>lost  and  never  finding  his  friends  again.  In  the  end,  in  spite  of  warnings,  hunger <
line 3624=>decided  them,  because  Bombur  kept  on  describing  all  the  good  things  that  were <
line 3625=>being eaten, according to his dream, in the woodland feast; so they all left the path <
line 3626=>he forest together.  <
line 3627=>After  a  good  deal  of  creeping  and  crawling  they  peered  round  the  trunks  and <
line 3628=>looked  into  a  clearing where  some  trees  had  been  felled  and  the  ground  levelled. <
line 3629=>There were many people there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green and brown <
line 3630=>of  the  felled  trees  in  a  great  circle.  There was  a  fire  in <
line 3631=>their midst  and  there were  torches  fastened  to  some  of  the  trees  round  about;  but <
line 3632=>most splendid sight of all: they were eating and drinking and laughing merrily.  <
line 3633=>The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to consult <
line 3634=>ne  of  them  got  up  and  scrambled  forwards  into  the  ring with <
line 3635=>the  one  idea  of  begging  for  some  food.  No  sooner  had  the  first  stepped  into  the <
line 3636=>0lights went out as  if by magic. Somebody kicked the fire and <
line 3637=>it  went  up  in  rockets  of  glittering  sparks  and  vanished.  They  were  lost  in  a <
line 3638=>completely  lightless dark and  they could not even find one another, not for a  long <
line 3639=>time  at  any  rate.  After  blundering  frantically  in  the  gloom,  falling  over  logs, <
line 3640=>0nto  trees,  and  shouting  and  calling  till  they  must  have  waked <
line 3641=>everything  in  the  forest  for miles,  at  last  they managed  to  gather  themselves  in  a <
line 3642=>mselves  by  touch.  By  that  time  they  had,  of  course,  quite <
line 3643=>forgotten  in what direction  the path  lay,  and  they were  all hopelessly  lost,  at  least <
line 3644=>thing for it but to settle down for the night where they were; they <
line 3645=>did not  even dare  to  search on  the ground  for  scraps of  food  for  fear of becoming <
line 3646=>ot been lying long, and Bilbo was only just getting <
line 3647=>drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch first, said in a loud whisper: <
line 3648=>t  again  over  there,  and  there  are more  than  ever  of <
line 3649=>them." <
line 3650=>There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling <
line 3651=>lights, and  they heard  the voices and  the  laughter quite plainly. They crept slowly <
line 3652=>towards  them,  in  a  single  line,  each  touching  the  back  of  the  one  in  front. When <
line 3653=>they  got  near Thorin  said:  "No  rushing  forward  this  time! No  one  is  to  stir  from <
line 3654=>hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them. They won't be <
line 3655=>frightened  of  him-('What  about me  of  them?'  thought  Bilbo)-and any way  I hope <
line 3656=>o him." <
line 3657=>e  edge  of  the  circle  of  lights  they  pushed  Bilbo  suddenly <
line 3658=> time  to  slip on his  ring, he  stumbled  forward  into  the <
line 3659=>full blaze of the fire and torches. It was no good. Out went all the lights again and <
line 3660=>0darkness fell. If  it had been difficult collecting  themselves before,  it was <
line 3661=>s  time.  And  they  simply  could  not  find  the  hobbit.  Every  time  they <
line 3662=>counted  themselves  it  only  made  thirteen.  They  shouted  and  called:  "Bilbo <
line 3663=>tted  hobbit!  Hi!  hobbit,  confusticate  you,  where  are <
line 3664=>you?" and other things of that sort, but there was no answer.  <
line 3665=>They were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. <
line 3666=>er what he thought was a log, and he found it was the hobbit <
line 3667=>curled  up  fast  asleep.  It  took  a  deal  of  shaking  to  wake  him,  and  when  he  was <
line 3668=>awake he was not pleased at all. <
line 3669=>. I  was  having  such  a  lovely  dream,"  he  grumbled,  "all  about  having  a  most <
line 3670=>0dinner." <
line 3671=>"Good  heavens!  he  has  gone  like  Bombur,"  they  said.  "Don't  tell  us  about <
line 3672=>dreams. Dream-dinners aren't any good, and we can't share them." <
line 3673=>ikely  to get  in  this beastly place," he muttered,  as he <
line 3674=>lay  down  beside  the  dwarves  and  tried  to  go  back  to  sleep  and  find  his  dream <
line 3675=>again.  But  that  was  not  the  last  of  the  lights  in  the  forest.  Later  when  the  night <
line 3676=>must  have  been  getting  old,  Kili  who  was  watching  then,  came  and  roused  them <
line 3677=>all again, saying: <
line 3678=>blaze of light begun not far away â€“ hundreds of torches and <
line 3679=>many fires must have been lit suddenly and by magic. And hark to the singing and <
line 3680=>the harps!" <
line 3681=>After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire <
line 3682=>  and  try  once  more  to  get  help.  Up  they  got  again;  and  this  time  the <
line 3683=>result  was  disastrous.  The  feast  that  they  now  saw  was  greater  and  more <
line 3684=>re;  and  at  the head of  a  long  line of  feasters  sat  a woodland <
line 3685=>king  with  a  crown  of  leaves  upon  his  golden  hair,  very  much  as  Bombur  had <
line 3686=>am. The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand to <
line 3687=><
line 3688=>####-hand  and  across  the  fires,  and  some  were  harping  and many  were  singing.  Their <
line 3689=>hair  was  twined  with  flowers;  green  and  white  gems  glinted  on  their <
line 3690=>collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with mirth. Loud <
line 3691=>and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin into their midst. <
line 3692=>Dead  silence  fell  in  the middle of  a word. Out went  all  light. The  fires  leaped <
line 3693=>mokes.  Ashes  and  cinders  were  in  the  eyes  of  the  dwarves,  and  the <
line 3694=>wood  was  filled  again  with  their  clamour  and  their  cries.  Bilbo  found  himself <
line 3695=>d (as he thought) and calling and calling: "Dori, Nori, Ori, <
line 3696=>Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield," <
line 3697=>while people he could not see or  feel were doing  the same all  round him  (with an <
line 3698=>occasional "Bilbo!" thrown in). But the cries of the others got steadily further and <
line 3699=>fainter,  and  though  after  a while  it  seemed  to  him  they  changed  to  yells and cries <
line 3700=> help  in  the  far distance, all noise at  last died  right away, and he was  left alone <
line 3701=>in complete silence and darkness. <
line 3702=>ss. That was  one  of  his most miserable moments. But  he  soon made  up  his mind <
line 3703=>that  it was no good  trying  to do  anything  till  day came with some  little  light, and <
line 3704=>quite  useless  to  go  blundering  about  tiring  himself  out  with  no  hope  of  any <
line 3705=> So he sat himself down with his back to a tree, and not for <
line 3706=>the  last  time  fell  to  thinking  of  his  far-distant  hobbit-hole  with  its  beautiful <
line 3707=>ries. He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when he <
line 3708=>ch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against his left <
line 3709=>hand,  and when  he  tried  to move  he  found  that  his  legs were  already wrapped  in <
line 3710=>0he same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over.  <
line 3711=>Then  the great  spider, who had been busy  tying him up while he dozed, came <
line 3712=>e  at  him.  He  could  only  see  the  things's  eyes,  but  he <
line 3713=>could  feel  its  hairy  legs  as  it  struggled  to wind  its  abominable  threads  round  and <
line 3714=>he had come to his senses in time. Soon he would not <
line 3715=>have  been  able  to  move  at  all.  As  it  was,  he  had  a  desperate  fight  before  he  got <
line 3716=>He  beat  the  creature  off  with  his  hands-it  was  trying  to  poison  him  to  keep <
line 3717=>quiet,  as  small  spiders  do  to  flies-until he  remembered his  sword  and drew  it <
line 3718=>out. Then the spider jumped back, and he had time to cut his legs loose. After that <
line 3719=> to  attack.  The  spider  evidently was  not  used  to  things  that carried <
line 3720=>such stings at  their sides, or  it would have hurried away quicker. Bilbo came at  it <
line 3721=>0ear  and  struck  it  with  his  sword  right  in  the  eyes.  Then  it <
line 3722=>went mad  and  leaped  and  danced  and  flung  out  its  legs  in  horrible  jerks, until he <
line 3723=>ther stroke; and then he fell down and remembered nothing more <
line 3724=>for a long while. <
line 3725=>There was  the usual dim grey  light of  the  forest-day about him when he came <
line 3726=>to  his  senses.  The  spider  lay  dead  beside  him,  and  his  sword-blade  was  stained <
line 3727=>of  the  giant  spider,  all  alone  by  himself  in  the  dark <
line 3728=>without  the  help  of  the  wizard  or  the  dwarves  or  of  anyone  else,  made  a  great <
line 3729=>difference  to Mr. Baggins. He  felt a different person, and much  fiercer and bolder <
line 3730=> of  an  empty  stomach,  as  he wiped  his  sword  on  the  grass  and  put  it  back <
line 3731=>into its sheath. <
line 3732=>e," he said to it, "and I shall call you Sting." <
line 3733=>After  that he  set out  to  explore. The  forest was grim  and  silent, but obviously <
line 3734=>l  to  look  for  his  friends,  who  were  not  likely  to  be  very  far  off, <
line 3735=>unless they had been made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). <
line 3736=>Bilbo  felt  that  it was unsafe  to  shout,  and he  stood  a  long while wondering  in <
line 3737=>the path lay,  and in what direction he should go first to look for the <
line 3738=>  we  not  remember  Beorn's  advice,  and  Gandalf's!"  he <
line 3739=>lamented.  "What  a mess we  are  in  now! We!  I  only wish  it was we:  it  is  horrible <
line 3740=>being all alone." <
line 3741=>s good a guess as he could at the direction from which the <
line 3742=>s for help had come in the night â€“ and by luck (he was born with a good share <
line 3743=>of  it) be guessed more or  less  right, as you will  see. Having made up his mind he <
line 3744=>crept  along  as  cleverly  as  he  could.  Hobbits  are  clever  at quietness,  especially  in <
line 3745=>lready  told  you;  also  Bilbo  had  slipped  on  his  ring  before  he <
line 3746=>startehe spiders neither saw nor heard him coming. <
line 3747=>way stealthily 'for some distance, when he noticed a place of <
line 3748=>dense  black  shadow  ahead  of  him  black  even  for  that  forest,  like  a  patch  of <
line 3749=>midnight  that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw  that  it was <
line 3750=>made  by  spider-webs one behind  and over  and  tangled with  another. Suddenly he <
line 3751=>e  spiders  huge  and  horrible  sitting  in  the  branches  above <
line 3752=>g  he  trembled  with  fear  lest  they  should  discover  him. <
line 3753=>ed a group of them for some time, and then in the <
line 3754=>silence  and  stillness  of  the  wood  he  realised  that  these  loathsome  creatures  were <
line 3755=>o another. Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing, but <
line 3756=>he could make out many of  the words  that  they said. They were  talking about  the <
line 3757=>dwarves! <
line 3758=>0le, but worth  it,"  said one.  "What nasty  thick  skins  they <
line 3759=> there is good juice inside." <
line 3760=><
line 3761=>####-"Aye, they'll make fine eating, when they've hung a bit," said another.  <
line 3762=>"  too  long,"  said  a  third.  "They're  not  as  fat  as  they might  be. <
line 3763=>Been feeding none too well of late, I should guess." <
line 3764=>"Kill'em, I say," hissed a fourth; "kill 'em now and hang 'em dead for a while." <
line 3765=>ad now, I'll warrant," said the first. <
line 3766=>I'll warrant," said the first. w one a-struggling just now. Just coming round again, I <
line 3767=>should say, after a bee-autiful sleep. I'll show you." <
line 3768=>With that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope, till it came to a dozen bundles <
line 3769=>hanging  ina  high  branch.  Bilbo  was  horrified,  now  that  he  noticed <
line 3770=>ng in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot sticking out <
line 3771=>of  the bottoms of some of  the bundles, or here and  there  the  tip of a nose, or a bit <
line 3772=>f a hood. <
line 3773=>To the fattest of these bundles the spider went--"It is poor old Bombur, I'll bet," <
line 3774=>thought Bilbo  â€“  and  nipped  hard  at  the  nose  that  stuck  out. There was  a muffled <
line 3775=>yelp  inside,  and  a  toe  shot  up  and  kicked  the  spider  straight  and  hard. There was <
line 3776=>life  in  Bombur  still.  There  was  a  noise  like  the  kicking  of  a  flabby  football,  and <
line 3777=>the branch, only catching  itself with  its own  thread  just <
line 3778=>0n time. <
line 3779=>"You  were  quite  right,"  they  said,  "the  meat's  alive  and <
line 3780=>    " <
line 3781=>"I'll  soon  put  an  end  to  that,"  hissed  the  angry  spider  climbing  back  onto  the <
line 3782=>branch. <
line 3783=>Bilbo  saw  that  the moment  had  come  when  he must  do  something.  He  could <
line 3784=>not  get  up  at  the  brutes  and  he  had  nothing  to  shoot  with;  but  looking  about  he <
line 3785=>saw  that  in  this place  there were many  stones  lying  in what appeared  to be  a now <
line 3786=> little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and it did not take <
line 3787=>him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily.  <
line 3788=>As  a  boy  he  used  to  practise  throwing  stones  at  things,  until  rabbits  and <
line 3789=>squirrels,  and even birds, got out of his way as quick as  lightning  if  they saw him <
line 3790=>even  grownup  he  had  still  spent  a  deal  of  his  time  at  quoits,  dart-<
line 3791=>throwing,  shooting  at  the  wand,  bowls,  ninepins  and  other  quiet  games  of  the <
line 3792=>aiming  and  throwing  sort-indeed  he  could  do  lots  of  things,  besides  blowing <
line 3793=>nd cooking, that I haven't had time to tell you about. <
line 3794=>There  is  no  time  now.  While  he  was  picking  up  stones,  the  spider  had  reached <
line 3795=>  soon  he  would  have  been  dead.  At  that  moment  Bilbo  threw.  The <
line 3796=>der plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop <
line 3797=>to the ground, with all its legs curled up. <
line 3798=>th all its legs curled up.   stone  went  whizzing  through  a  big  web,  snapping  its  cords,  and <
line 3799=>r sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. After that there was a <
line 3800=>deal  of  commotion  in  the  spider-colony,  and  they  forgot  the  dwarves  for  a  bit,  I <
line 3801=>  not  see Bilbo,  but  they  could make  a  good  guess  at  the <
line 3802=>stones  were  coming.  As  quick  as  lightning  they  came <
line 3803=>running  and  swinging  towards  the  hobbit,  flinging  out  their  long  threads  in  all <
line 3804=>directions,  till  the  air  seemed  full  of waving  snares. Bilbo,  however,  soon  slipped <
line 3805=> a different place. The idea came to him to lead the furious spiders further <
line 3806=>and further away from the dwarves, if he could; to make them curious, excited and <
line 3807=>ut  fifty  had  gone  off  to  the  place where  he  had  stood <
line 3808=>es at these, and at others that had stopped behind; <
line 3809=>then dancing among  the  trees he began  to  sing a  song  to  infuriate  them and bring <
line 3810=>them all after him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice. <
line 3811=>sang: <
line 3812=>0g in a tree! <
line 3813=>'t see me! <
line 3814=><
line 3815=>ning and look for me! <
line 3816=> <
line 3817=>Old Tomnoddy, all big body,  <
line 3818=>Old Tomnoddy can't spy me! <
line 3819=>Attercop! Attercop! <
line 3820=>ever catch me up your tree! <
line 3821=><
line 3822=> <
line 3823=>Not very good perhaps, but then you must remember that he had to make it up <
line 3824=>himself, on  the  spur of  a very  awkward moment.  It did what he wanted  any way. <
line 3825=>As he  sang he  threw  some more  stones  and  stamped. Practically  all  the  spiders  in <
line 3826=>the  place  came  after  him:  some  dropped  to  the  ground,  others  raced  along  the <

line 3830=>Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody.  <
line 3831=> insulting to anybody.   scuttled  to  a  fresh  place,  but  several  of  the  spiders  had  run  now  to <
line 3832=>different points in the glade where they lived, and were busy spinning webs across <
line 3833=>n  the  tree-stems.  Very  soon  the  hobbit would be  caught  in  a <
line 3834=>all round him-that at least was the spiders' idea. Standing now <
line 3835=>in  the  middle  of  the  hunting  and  spinning  insects  Bilbo  plucked  up  his  courage <
line 3836=>and began a new song: <
line 3837=> <
line 3838=><
line 3839=>####-Lazy Lob and crazy Cob <
line 3840=>are weaving webs to wind me. <
line 3841=>I am far more sweet than other meat, <
line 3842=>other meat, ll they cannot find me! <
line 3843=>t find me! am I, naughty little fly; <
line 3844=>ttle fly; re fat and lazy.  <
line 3845=>You cannot trap me, though you try, <
line 3846=>gh you try, cobwebs crazy.  <
line 3847=>he  turned  and  found  that  the  last  space  between  two  tall  trees  had <
line 3848=> a web-but luckily not a proper web, only great strands of double-<
line 3849=>ily  backwards  and  forwards  from  trunk  to  trunk.  Out <
line 3850=>came his little' sword. He slashed the threads to pieces and went off singing. <
line 3851=> sword, though I don't suppose they knew what it was, and <
line 3852=>at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and <
line 3853=>y legs waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes popping, full <
line 3854=>of froth and red him into the forest until Bilbo had gone as far as <
line 3855=>he dared. <
line 3856=>tole back. He had precious little time, he knew, <
line 3857=>before  the  spiders were disgusted and came back  to  their  trees where  the dwarves <
line 3858=>while he had to rescue them. The worst part of the job was <
line 3859=>getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling. I don't suppose <
line 3860=>0naged  it,  if  a  spider  had  not  luckily  left  a  rope  hanging  down; <
line 3861=>withough  it  stuck  to  his  hand  and  hurt  him,  he  scrambled  up-only  to <
line 3862=> wicked  fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to guard the <
line 3863=>nching them to see which was the juiciest to eat. It <
line 3864=>had  thought of starting  the feast while  the others were away, but Mr. Baggins was <
line 3865=>before  the  spider  knew  what  was  happening  it  felt  his  sting  and <
line 3866=>rollch dead. Bilbo's next  job was  to  loose  a dwarf. What was he  to <
line 3867=>ng  which  hung  him  up,  the  wretched  dwarf  would  tumble <
line 3868=>thump to the ground a good way below. Wriggling along the branch (which made <
line 3869=>es dance and dangle like ripe fruit) he reached the first bundle. <
line 3870=>"Fili  or  Kit  by  the  tip  of  a  blue  hood  sticking  out  at  the  top. <
line 3871=>ht by  the  tip of a  long nose poking out of  the winding <
line 3872=>threads. He managed by  leaning over  to cut most of  the strong sticky  threads  that <
line 3873=>bound  him  round,  and  then,  sure  enough, with  a  kick  and  a  struggle most  of  Fili <
line 3874=>emerged.  I  am  afraid  Bilbo  actually  laughed  at  the  sight  of  him  jerking  his  stiff <
line 3875=><
line 3876=>####-arms and  legs as he danced on  the  spider-string under his armpits, just like one of <
line 3877=>s bobbing on a wire. <
line 3878=>Somehow  or  other  Fili  was  got  on  to  the  branch,  and  then  he  did  his  best  to <
line 3879=>help  the hobbit,  although he was  feeling very  sick  and  ill  from  spider-poison, and <
line 3880=>0st  of  the  night  and  the  next  day  wound  round  and  round  with <
line 3881=>only hie through. It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of his <
line 3882=>is beard, he had to cut most of it off. Well, between <
line 3883=>them  they started  to haul up  first one dwarf and  then another and slash  them  free. <
line 3884=>were  better  off  than  Fili,  and  some  of  them were worse.  Some  had <
line 3885=>hardly  been  able  to breathe  at  all  (long noses  are  sometimes useful you  see),  and <
line 3886=>oned. <
line 3887=>0ued  Kili,  Bifur,  Bofur,  Don  and  Nori.  Poor  old  Bombur <
line 3888=>was  so  exhausted-he was  the  fattest  and  had  been  constantly  pinched  and  poked-<
line 3889=>that  he  just  rolled off  the branch  and  fell plop on  to  the ground,  fortunately on  to <
line 3890=>leaves,  and  lay  there.  But  there were  still  five  dwarves  hanging  at  the  end  of  the <
line 3891=>branch  when  the  spiders  began  to  come  back,  more  full  of  rage  than  ever.  Bilbo <
line 3892=>immediately  went  to  the  end  of  the  branch  nearest  the  tree-trunk  and  kept  back <
line 3893=>those that crawled up. He had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili and forgotten <
line 3894=>so now they all began to splutter and hiss: <
line 3895=>ll began to splutter and hiss:   you  nasty  little  creature!  We  will  eat  you  and  leave  your <
line 3896=>0 a tree. Ugh! he's got a sting has he? Well, we'll get him <
line 3897=>all the same, and then we'll hang him head downwards for a day or two." <
line 3898=>While  this,  the  other  dwarves  were  working  at  the  rest  of  the <
line 3899=>0aptives,  and  cutting  at  the  threads  with  their  knives.  Soon  all  would  be  free, <
line 3900=>though  it  was  not  clear  what  would  happen  after  that.  The  spiders  had  caught <
line 3901=>them  pretty  easily  the  night  before,  but  that  had  been  unawares  and  in  the  dark. <
line 3902=>This time there looked like being a horrible battle. <

line 3909=>killed beforoff and left Bombur to Bilbo. <
line 3910=> to Bilbo. Come  down! Come  down!"  he  shouted  to  the  dwarves  on  the  branch.  "Don't <
line 3911=>stay up  there and be netted!" For he saw spiders swarming up all  the neighboring <
line 3912=>0 the boughs above the heads of the dwarves. <
line 3913=>above the heads of the dwarves. ves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most <
line 3914=>of  them  very  shaky  and  little  use  on  their  legs. There  they were  at  last,  twelve  of <
line 3915=>them counting poor old Bombur, who was being propped up on either  side by his <
line 3916=> and his brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing about and waving his <
line 3917=>Sting;  and  hundreds  of  angry  spiders were  goggling  at  them  all  round  and  about <
line 3918=>and above. It looked pretty hopeless. <
line 3919=>ove. It looked pretty hopeless.  Some  of  the  dwarves  had  knives,  and some had sticks, <
line 3920=>and  all  of  them  could  get  at  stones;  and  Bilbo  had  his  elvish  dagger.  Again  and <
line 3921=>again  the spiders were beaten off, and many of  them were killed. But  it could not <
line 3922=>go  on  for  long. Bilbo was  nearly  tired  out;  only  four  of  the  dwarves were  able to <
line 3923=>stand firmly, and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies. Already the <
line 3924=>weave their webs all round them again from tree to tree. <
line 3925=>In the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the secret of <
line 3926=> rather sorry about it, but it could not be helped. <
line 3927=>"I  am  going  to  disappear,"  he  said.  "I  shall  draw  the  spiders  off,  if  I  can;  and <
line 3928=>you must keep  together  and make  in  the opposite direction. To  the  left  there,  that <
line 3929=>is more or less the way towards the place where we last saw the elf-fires." <
line 3930=>It was difficult to get them to understand, what with their dizzy heads, and the <
line 3931=>shouts, and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at last Bilbo felt <
line 3932=>he  could  delay  no  longer-the  spiders  were  drawing  their  circle  ever  closer.  He <
line 3933=>suddenly  slipped  on  his  ring,  and  to  the  great  astonishment  of  the  dwarves  he <
line 3934=>he  sound  of  "Lazy  Lob"  and  "Attercop"  from  among  the <
line 3935=>trees  away  on  the  right.  That  upset  the  spiders  greatly. They  stopped  advancing, <
line 3936=> some,  went  off  in  the  direction  of  the  voice.  "Attercop" made  them  so  angry <
line 3937=>they  lost  their wits. Then Balin, who had grasped Bilbo's plan better  than  the <
line 3938=>rest, led an attack. The dwarves huddled together in a knot, and sending a shower <
line 3939=>of  stones  they  drove  at  the  spiders  on  the  left,  and  burst  through  the  ring.  Away <
line 3940=>behind uting and singing suddenly stopped. <
line 3941=>d uting and singing suddenly stopped. ilbo  had  not  been  caught  the  dwarves went  on. Not <
line 3942=>nough, though. They were sick and weary, and they could not go much better <
line 3943=>wobble, though many of the spiders were close behind. Every <
line 3944=>now  and  then  they  had  to  turn  and  fight  the  creatures  that were  overtaking  them <
line 3945=>and  already  some  spiders  were  in  the  trees  above  them  and  throwing  down  their <
line 3946=>long clinging threads. <
line 3947=>Things  were  looking  pretty  bad  again,  when  suddenly  Bilbo  appeared  and <
line 3948=>charged into the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the side. <
line 3949=><
line 3950=>####-"Go  on!  Go  on!"  he  shouted.  "I  will  do  the  stinging!"  And  he did. He darted <
line 3951=>backwards  and  forwards,  slashing  at  spider-threads,  hacking  at  their  legs,  and <
line 3952=>ing  at  their  fat  bodies  if  they  came  too  near.  The  spiders  swelled  with  rage, <
line 3953=>and  spluttered  and  frothed,  and  hissed  out  horrible  curses;  but  they  had  become <
line 3954=>ly afraid of Sting, and dared not come very near, now that it had come back. <
line 3955=>would,  their prey moved slowly but steadily away. It was a most <
line 3956=>terrible businto take hours. But at last, just when Bilbo felt that he <
line 3957=>could  not  lift  his  hand  for  a  single  stroke  more,  the  spiders  suddenly  gave  it  up, <
line 3958=>and followed them no more, but went back disappointed to their dark colony.  <
line 3959=>The  dwarves  then  noticed  that  they  had  come  to  the  edge  of  a  ring where  elf-<
line 3960=>fires  had  it  was  one  of  those  they  had  seen  the  night  before,  they <
line 3961=>0  seemed  that  some  good magic  lingered  in  such  spots, which <
line 3962=> any rate here the light was greener, and the boughs less <
line 3963=> and threatening, and they had a chance to rest and draw breath. <
line 3964=>puffing and panting. put very soon they began to <
line 3965=>ask questions. They had to have the whole vanishing business carefully explained, <
line 3966=>and  the  f ring  interested  them  so  much  that  for  a  while  they  forgot <
line 3967=>in particular insisted on having the Gollum story, riddles <
line 3968=>and  all,  told  all  over  again, with  the  ring  in  its  proper  place. But  after  a  time  the <
line 3969=>then  other  questions  were  asked.  Where  were  they,  and <
line 3970=>where was their path, and where was there any food, and what were they going to <
line 3971=>  questions  they  asked  over  and  over  again,  and  it  was  from  little <
line 3972=>0 seemed  to expect  to get  the answers. From which you can see  that <
line 3973=>they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins very much, and had begun to have <
line 3974=>a  great  respect  for  him  (as  Gandalf  had  said  they  would).  Indeed  they  really <
line 3975=>expected  him  to  think  of  some  wonderful  plan  for  helping  them,  and  were  not <
line 3976=>They  knew  only  too  well  that  they  would  soon  all  have  been <
line 3977=>0for the hobbit; and they thanked him many times. Some of <
line 3978=>them even got up and bowed right to the ground before him, though they fell over <
line 3979=>and  could  not  get  on  their  legs  again  for  some  time. Knowing  the <
line 3980=>trunishing did not  lessen  their opinion of Bilbo at all;  for  they saw <
line 3981=>s,  as  well  as  luck  and  a  magic  ring-and  all  three  are  very <
line 3982=>act they praised him so much that Bilbo began to feel there <
line 3983=>really  was  something  of  a  bold  adventurer  about  himself  after  all,  though  he  I <
line 3984=>would have felt a lot bolder still, if there had been anything to eat. <
line 3985=>But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them Were fit to go and look <
line 3986=>,  or  to  search  for  the  lost  path.  The  lost  path!  No  other  idea  would <
line 3987=><
line 3988=>####-come into Bilbo's tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at the endless trees; <
line 3989=>and  after  a while  they  all  fell  silent  again. All  except Balin. Long  after  the others <
line 3990=>had  stopped  talking  and  shut  their  eyes,  he  kept  on  muttering  and  chuckling  to <
line 3991=>himself. <
line 3992=>"Gollum! Well I'm blest! So that's how he sneaked past me is it? Now I know! <
line 3993=>long  did  you,  Mr.  Baggins?  Buttons  all  over  the  doorstep? <
line 3994=>Good  old  B-bo-bo-boâ€“"  And  then  he  fell  asleep,  and  there  was <

line 3997=>Thorin?"  he  asked.  It  was  a  terrible  shock.  Of  course  there  were  only  thirteen of <
line 3998=>them,  twelve dwarves and  the hobbit. Where  indeed was Thorin? They wondered <
line 3999=>befallen  him,  magic  or  dark  monsters;  and  shuddered  as  they <
line 4000=>lay  lost  in  the  forest. There  they dropped off one by one  into uncomfortable  sleep <
line 4001=>full  of  horrible  dreams,  as  evening wore  to  black  night;  and  there we must  leave <
line 4002=>em for the present, too sick and weary to set guards or take turns watching. <
line 4003=> caught  much  faster  than  they  had.  You  remember  Bilbo <
line 4004=>falling  like  a  log  into  sleep,  as  he  stepped  into  a  circle  of  light?  The  next  time  it <
line 4005=>0tepped  forward,  and  as  the  lights  went  out  he  fell  like  a <
line 4006=>e  noise  of  the  dwarves  lost  in  the  night,  their  cries  as  the <
line 4007=>d bound them, and all the sounds of the battle next day, had <
line 4008=>passed over him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come to him, and bound him, <
line 4009=>. The feasting people were Wood-elves, of course. These are <
line 4010=>not wicked folk. If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their magic <
line 4011=>was strong, even in those days they were wary. They differed from the High Elves <
line 4012=>of  the West,  and were more  dangerous  and  less wise.  For most  of  them  (together <
line 4013=>0ith  their  scattered  relations  in  the hills  and mountains) were  descended from the <
line 4014=>ancient  tribes  that never went  to Faerie  in  the West. There  the Light-elves and the <
line 4015=>Deep-elves  and  the  Sea-elves  went  and  lived  for  ages,  and  grew  fairer  and  wiser <
line 4016=>and more learned, and invented their magic and their cunning craft, in the making <
line 4017=>ous  things,  before  some  came  back  into  the Wide World. <
line 4018=>In  the Wide World  the Wood-elves  lingered  in  the  twilight of  our Sun  and Moon <
line 4019=>but  loved  best  the  stars;  and  they  wandered  in  the  great  forests  that  grew  tall  in <
line 4020=>lands  that  are  now  lost.  They  dwelt  most  often  by  the  edges  of  the  woods,  from <
line 4021=>which they could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run over the open lands by <
line 4022=>moonlight or starlight; and after the coming of Men they took ever more and more <
line 4023=>to  the  gloaming  and  the  dusk. Still  elves  they were  and  remain,  and  that  is Good <
line 4024=>People. <
line 4025=>some  miles  within  the  edge  of  Mirkwood  on  its  eastern  side <
line 4026=>there  livme  their  greatest  king. Before  his  huge  doors  of  stone  a  river <
line 4027=>ran  out  of  the  heights  of  the  forest  and  flowed on  and out  into  the marshes  at  the <
line 4028=>feetded lands. This great cave, from which countless smaller ones <
line 4029=>opened  out  on  every  side,  wound  far  underground  and  had  many  passages  and <
line 4030=>wide  halls;  but  it was  lighter  and more wholesome  than  any  goblin-dwelling, and <
line 4031=>0or so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and <
line 4032=>hunted  in  ,  and  had  houses  or  huts  on  the  ground  and  in  the <
line 4033=>branches. The  beeches were  their  favourite  trees. The  king's  cave  was his palace, <
line 4034=>and  the  strong  place  of  his  treasure,  and  the  fortress  of  his  people  against  their <
line 4035=>enemies. <
line 4036=>It was  also  the  dungeon  of  his  prisoners.  So  to  the  cave  they  dragged Thorin-<
line 4037=>not  too  gently,  for  they  did  not  love  dwarves,  and  thought  he  was  an  enemy.  In <
line 4038=>ancient days  they had had wars with some of  the dwarves, whom  they accused of <
line 4039=>stealing  their  treasure.  It  is  only  fair  to  say  that  the  dwarves  gave  a  different <
line 4040=>d that they only took what was their due, for the elf-king had bar- <
line 4041=>e  his  raw  gold  and  silver,  and  had  afterwards  refused  to <
line 4042=> the  elf-king had  a weakness  it was  for  treasure,  especially <
line 4043=>for  silver  and  white  gems;  and  though  his  hoard  was  rich,  he  was  ever  eager  for <
line 4044=>more, since he  had not yet  as great  a  treasure  as other  elf-lords of old. His people <
line 4045=>neither mined nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother much with trade or <
line 4046=>with  tilling  the  earth.  All  this  was  well  known  to  every  dwarf,  though  Thorin's <
line 4047=>family had had nothing  to do with the old quarrel I have spoken of. Consequently <

line 4051=>ternly  on  Thorin,  when  he  was  brought  before  him,  and <
line 4052=>asked him many questions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving. <
line 4053=>your  folk  three  times  try  to  attack  my  people  at  their <
line 4054=>merrymaking?" asked the king. <
line 4055=>"We  did  not  attack  them,"  answered  Thorin;  "we  came  to  beg,  because  we <
line 4056=>were starving." <
line 4057=>w, and what are they doing?" <
line 4058=>"I don't know, but I expect starving in the forest." <
line 4059=>"What were you doing in the forest?" <
line 4060=>e forest?" ng for food and drink, because we were starving." <
line 4061=>"But what brought you into the forest at all?" asked the king angrily.  <
line 4062=><
line 4063=>####-At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word. <
line 4064=> "Take  him  away  and  keep  him  safe,  until  he  feels <
line 4065=>inclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.'" <
line 4066=>n the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves with <
line 4067=>, and left him. They gave him food and drink, plenty of both, <
line 4068=>if  not  very  fine;  for  Wood-elves  were  not  goblins,  and  were  reasonably  well-<
line 4069=>behaved even  to  their worst enemies, when  they captured  them. The giant  spiders <
line 4070=>were the only living things that they had no mercy upon. <
line 4071=>There  in  the  king's  dungeon  poor  Thorin  lay;  and  after  he  had  got  over  his <
line 4072=>eat and water, he began to wonder what had become <
line 4073=>of  his  unfortunate  friends.  It  was  not  very  long  before  he  discovered;  but  that <

line 4096=>  Each  dwarf  was  blindfold,  but  that  did  not  make  much <
line 4097=>difference,  for  even Bilbo with  the  use  of  his  eyes  could  not  see where  they were <
line 4098=>going,  and  neither  he  nor  the  others  knew  where  they  had  started  from  anyway. <
line 4099=>  had  all  he  could  do  to  keep  up with  the  torches,  for  the  elves were making <
line 4100=>the dwarves go  as  fast  as  ever  they  could,  sick  and weary  as  they were. The king <
line 4101=>had ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and the hobbit had <
line 4102=>hem  up  before  they  began  to  cross  the  bridge.  This  was  the <
line 4103=>bridge  that  led  across  the  river  to  the  king's  doors.  The  water  flowed  dark  and <
line 4104=>swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before the mouth of a huge <
line 4105=>that  ran  into  the  side  of  a  steep  slope  covered  with  trees.  There  the  great <
line 4106=>beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were in the stream. Across this <
line 4107=>bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear. He did not at <
line 4108=>of  the  cavern-mouth  and  he  only made  up  his mind  not  to desert <
line 4109=>his friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the fast elves, before the great <
line 4110=>gates of the king closed behind them with a clang. <
line 4111=>the  passages  were  lit  with  red  torch-light,  and  the  elf-guards  sang  as <
line 4112=>they marched along  the  twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not like <
line 4113=><
line 4114=>####-those  of  the  goblin-cities:  they  were  smaller,  less  deep  underground,  and  filled <
line 4115=>with  a  cleaner  air.  In  a  great  hall with  pillars  hewn  out  of  the  living  stone  sat  the <
line 4116=>Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries and red <
line 4117=>s  come  again.  In  the  spring  he  wore  a  crown  of <
line 4118=>woodland flowers. In his hand he held a carven staff of oak. <
line 4119=>The prisoners were brought before him; and though he looked grimly at them, <
line 4120=>ind  them,  for  they  were  ragged  and  weary.  "Besides  they <
line 4121=>need no ropes e. "There is no escape from my magic doors for those <
line 4122=>who are once brought inside." <
line 4123=>Long and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings, and where <
line 4124=> they were coming from; but he got little more news <
line 4125=>out  of  them  than  out  of  Thorin.  They  were  surly  and  angry  and  did  not  even <
line 4126=>lite. <
line 4127=>0  king?"  said  Balin,  who  was  the  eldest  left.  "Is  it  a <
line 4128=>forest,  to  be  hungry  and  thirsty,  to  be  trapped  by  spiders? <
line 4129=>0ame beasts or your pets,  if killing  them makes you  angry?" <
line 4130=>0uch a question of course made the king angrier than ever, and he answered: "It is <
line 4131=>ander  in my  realm without  leave. Do you  forget  that you were  in my <
line 4132=>road  that  my  people  made?  Did  you  not  three  times  pursue <
line 4133=>and  trouble  the  forest  and  '  rouse  the  spiders  with  your  riot  and <
line 4134=>sturbance  you  have  made  I  have  a  right  to  know  what <
line 4135=>brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep you all in prison until <
line 4136=>you have learned sense and manners!" <
line 4137=>anners!"  he ordered  the dwarves  each  to be put  in  a  separate  cell  and  to be given <
line 4138=>food and drink, but not  to be allowed  to pass  the doors of  their  little prisons, until <
line 4139=>f  them was willing  to  tell him all he wanted  to know. But be did not <
line 4140=>tell  them  that  Thorin  was  also  a  prisoner  with  him.  It  was  Bilbo  who  found  that <
line 4141=>out. <
line 4142=> <
line 4143=>Poor  Mr.  Baggins  â€“  it  was  a  weary  long  time  that  he  lived  in  that  place  all <
line 4144=>alone,  and  always  in  hiding,  never  daring  to  take  off  his  ring,  hardly  daring  to <
line 4145=>sleep,  even  tucked  away  in  the  darkest  and  remotest  comers  he  could  find.  For <
line 4146=>something  to  do  he  took  to wandering  about  the  Elven-king's palace. Magic shut <
line 4147=>the  gates,  but  be  could  sometimes  get  out,  if  he  was  quick.  Companies  of  the <
line 4148=>Wood-elves,  sometimes with  the  king  at  their  head, would  from  time  to  time  ride <
line 4149=>out  to hunt, or  to other business  in  the woods and in the lands to the East. Then if <
line 4150=>0s  very  nimble,  he  could  slip  out  just  behind  them;  though  it  was  a <
line 4151=>  thing  to do. More  than once he was nearly caught  in  the doors, as  they <
line 4152=>clashed  together  when  the  last  elf  passed;  yet  he  did  not  dare  to  march  among <
line 4153=>is  shadow  (altogether  thin  and wobbly  as  it was  in  torch-light), <
line 4154=>ng  bumped  into  and  discovered. And when  he  did  go  out, which <
line 4155=>was  not  very  often,  he  did  no  good.  He  did  not  wish  to  desert  the  dwarves, and <
line 4156=>indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He could not keep <
line 4157=>the  hunting  elves  all  the  time  they  were  out,  so  he  never  discovered  the <
line 4158=>ways  out  of  the wood,  and was  left  to wander miserably  in  the  forest,  terrified  of <
line 4159=>losing  himself,  until  a  chance  came  of  returning. He was  hungry  too  outside,  for <
line 4160=>he was  no  hunter;  but  inside  the  caves  he  could  pick  up  a  living  of  some  sort  by <
line 4161=>stealing  food  from  store  or  table  when  no  one  was  at  hand.  "I  am  like  a  burglar <
line 4162=>that  can't  get  away,  but must  go  on miserably  burgling  the  same  house  day  after <
line 4163=>ought.  "This  is  the  dreariest  and  dullest  part  of  all  this  wretched, <
line 4164=>mfortable  adventure!  I  wish  I  was  back  in  my  hobbit-hole  by my <
line 4165=>own warm fireside with the lamp shining!" He often wished, too, that he could get <
line 4166=>essage for help sent to the wizard, but that of course was quite impossible; and <
line 4167=>he soon  realized  that  if anything was  to be done,  it would have  to be done by Mr. <
line 4168=>Baggins, alone and unaided. <
line 4169=>Eventually,  after  a week  or  two  of  this  sneaking  sort  of  life,  by watching  and <
line 4170=>following  the  guards  and  taking  what  chances  he  could,  he  managed  to  find  out <
line 4171=>where each dwarf was kept. He found all their twelve cells in different parts of the <
line 4172=>nd  after  a  time  he  got  to  know  his  way  about  very  well.  What  was  his <
line 4173=>e day to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that there was <
line 4174=>n too, in a specially deep dark place. He guessed at once, of <
line 4175=>course,  that  that was  Thorin;  and  after  a while he  found  that his guess was  right. <
line 4176=>At  last  after  many  difficulties  he  managed  to  find  the  place  when  no  one  was <
line 4177=>about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves. Thorin was too wretched <
line 4178=>nger  at  his  misfortunes,  and  was  even  beginning  to  think  of <
line 4179=>telling the king all about his treasure and his quest (which shows how low-spirited <
line 4180=>he had become), when he heard Bilbo's little voice at his keyhole. He could hardly <
line 4181=>believe  his  ears.  Soon  however  he  made  up  his  mind  that  he  could  not  be <
line 4182=>0  the door and had a  long whispered  talk with  the hobbit <
line 4183=>on the other side. <
line 4184=>t Bilbo was  able  to  take  secretly Thorin's message  to  each of  the <
line 4185=>rves,  telling  them  that  Thorin  their  chief was  also  in prison <
line 4186=>0at  no  one was  to  reveal  their  errand  to  the  long,  not  yet,  not <
line 4187=>  the  word.  For  Thorin  had  taken  heart  again  hearing  how  the <
line 4188=><
line 4189=>####-hoed  his  companions  from  the  spiders,  and  was  determined  once <
line 4190=>more  not self  with  promises  to  the  king  of  a  share  in  the  treasure, <
line 4191=>0aping  in  any  other  way  had  disappeared;  until  in  fact  the <
line 4192=>ggins (of whom he began to have a very high opinion <
line 4193=>indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.  <
line 4194=>The  other  dwarves  quite  agreed when  they  got  the message. They  all  thought <
line 4195=>the  treasure  (which  they  quite  regarded  as  theirs,  in  spite  of <
line 4196=>their   still unconquered dragon) would  suffer  seriously if the Wood-<
line 4197=> and  they  all  trusted  Bilbo.  Just  what  Gandalf  had  said <
line 4198=>haps  that  war  part  of  his  reason  for  going  off  and <
line 4199=>leaving them. <
line 4200=>id  not  feel  nearly  so  hopeful  as  they  did.  He  did  not  like <
line 4201=>ryone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. But that <
line 4202=>was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them. He sat <
line 4203=>ought,  until  his  head  nearly  burst,  but  no  bright  idea  would <
line 4204=>ng was  a  very  fine  thing,  but  it was  not much  good  among <
line 4205=>ou have guessed, he did  rescue his  friends  in  the end, <
line 4206=>and  this  is  how  it  happened.  One  day,  nosing  and  wandering  about.  Bilbo <
line 4207=>very  interesting  thing:  the  great  gates  were  not  the  only  entrance  to <
line 4208=>the  caves.  A  stream  flowed  under  part  of  the  lowest  regions  of  the  palace,  and <
line 4209=>t River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of <
line 4210=>which  the  main  mouth  opened.  Where  this  underground watercourse  came  forth <
line 4211=>from the hillside there was a water-gate. There the rocky roof came down close to <
line 4212=>the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed <
line 4213=> anyone  coming  in  or  out  that way. But  the  portcullis was <
line 4214=>f  traffic went out and  in by  the water-gate. If anyone <
line 4215=>had come in that way, he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading <
line 4216=> of the hill; but at one point where it  passed under the caves the <
line 4217=>roof  had   and  covered  with  great  oaken  trapdoors.  These  opened <
line 4218=>upwards  into  the  king's  cellars.  There  stood  barrels,  and  barrels,  and  barrels;  for <
line 4219=>the Wood-elves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no vines <
line 4220=>grew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from <
line 4221=>their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands. <
line 4222=>Hiding  behind  one  of  the  largest  barrels  Bilbo  discovered  the  trapdoors  and <
line 4223=>ing  there,  listening  to  the  talk of  the king's  servants, he  learned <
line 4224=>her goods came up the rivers, or over land, to the Long Lake. <
line 4225=>It  seemed  a  town of Men  still  throve  there, built out on bridges  far  into  the water <
line 4226=><
line 4227=>####-as  a  protection  against  enemies  of  all  sorts,  and  especially  against  the  dragon  of <
line 4228=>the  Mountain.  From  Lake-town  the  barrels  were  brought  up  the  Forest  River. <
line 4229=> they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the stream; <
line 4230=>ere loaded on to flat boats. <
line 4231=>When  the  barrels  were  empty  the  elves  cast  them  through  the  trapdoors, <
line 4232=>ter-gate,  and  out  the  barrels  floated  on  the  stream,  bobbing  along, <
line 4233=>until they were carried by the current to a place far down the river where the bank <
line 4234=> very  eastern  edge  of Mirkwood. There  they were  collected <
line 4235=>and  tied  together  and  floated  back  to  Lake-town,  which  stood  close  to  the  point <
line 4236=>ere the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake. <
line 4237=>me Bilbo  sat and  thought about  this water-gate, and wondered if it <
line 4238=>could  be  used  for  the  escape  of  his  friends,  and  at  last  he  had  the  desperate <
line 4239=>beginnings of a plan. <
line 4240=>The  evening meal had been  taken  to  the prisoners. The guards were  tramping <
line 4241=>awassages  taking  the  torch-light  with  them  and  leaving  everything <
line 4242=>bo  heard  the  king's  butler  bidding  the  chief  of  the  guards <
line 4243=>h me," he said, "and taste the new wine that has just come in. I <
line 4244=>clearing the cellars of the empty wood, so let us have <
line 4245=>a drink first to help the labour." <
line 4246=>bour." y good," laughed the chief of the guards. "I'll taste with you, and see if it is <
line 4247=>fit for the king's table. There is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up poor <
line 4248=>stuff!" <
line 4249=> <
line 4250=>When  he  heard  this  Bilbo  was  all  in  a  flutter,  for  he  saw  that  luck  was  with <
line 4251=> had  a  chance  at  once  to  try  his  desperate  plan.  He  followed  the  two <
line 4252=>elves, until  they entered a small cellar and sat down at a  table on which  two  large <
line 4253=>on they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an unusual <
line 4254=>kind was with Bilbo  then.  It must be potent wine  to make a wood-elf drowsy; but <
line 4255=>this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, <
line 4256=>not  meant  for  his  soldiers  or  his  servants,  but  for  the  king's  feasts  only,  and  for <
line 4257=>smalle the butler's great flagons. <
line 4258=>ons. ry soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table and fell <
line 4259=> butler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while without <
line 4260=> his head too nodded to the table, and he fell asleep and <
line 4261=>snored  beside  his  friend.  Then  in  crept  the  hobbit.  Very  soon  the chief guard had <
line 4262=><
line 4263=>####-no  keys,  but Bilbo was  trotting  as  fast  as  he  could  along  the  passage  towards  the <
line 4264=>cells. The  great  bunch  seemed  very  heavy  to  his  arms,  and  his  heart was  often  in <
line 4265=>s  mouth,  in  spite  of  his  ring,  for  he  could  not  prevent  the  keys  from  making <
line 4266=>every now and then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in a tremble. <
line 4267=>First  he  unlocked  Balin's  door,  and  locked  it  again  carefully  as  soon  as  the <
line 4268=>s most  surprised,  as  you  can  imagine;  but  glad  as  he <
line 4269=>was  to  get  out  of  his  wearisome  little  stone  room,  he  wanted  to  stop  and  ask <
line 4270=>tions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about it. <
line 4271=>"No  time  now!"  said  the  hobbit.  "You  must  follow  me!  We  must  all  keep <
line 4272=>together  and not  risk getting  separated. All of us must  escape or none,  and  this  is <
line 4273=>our  last  chance.  If  this  is  found out, goodness knows where  the king will put you <
line 4274=>ur hands and feet  too, I expect. Don't argue,  there's a good <
line 4275=>fellow!" <
line 4276=>om  door  to  door,  until  his  following  had  grown  to  twelve-<
line 4277=>mble,  what  with  the  dark,  and  what  with  their  long <
line 4278=>imprisonment. Bilbo's heart thumped every time one of them bumped into another, <
line 4279=>or  grunted  or  whispered  in  the  dark.  "Drat  this  dwarvish  racket!"  he  said  to <
line 4280=>himself. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there was a <
line 4281=>eat  autumn  feast  in  the woods  that night,  and  in  the halls  above. Nearly  all  the <
line 4282=>king's  folks  were  merrymaking.  At  last  after  much  blundering  they  came  to <
line 4283=>Thorin's  dungeon,  far  down  in  a  deep  place  and  fortunately  not  far  from  the <
line 4284=>word!"  said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and <
line 4285=>join his  friends,  "Gandalf  spoke  true,  as usual. A pretty  fine burglar you make,  it <
line 4286=>seems,  when  the  time  comes.  I  am  sure  we  are  all  for  ever  at  your  service, <
line 4287=>whatever happens after this. But what comes next?" <
line 4288=>time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he <
line 4289=>did  not  feel  at  all  sure  bow  the  dwarves  would  take  it.  His  fears  were  quite <
line 4290=>justified, for they did not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of their <
line 4291=>danger.  <
line 4292=>attered  to  pieces,  and  drowned  too,  for  certain!" <
line 4293=>uttered. "We thought you had got some sensible notion, when you managed <
line 4294=>to get hold of the keys. This is a mad idea!" <
line 4295=> This is a mad idea!" ll!" said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. "Come  along <
line 4296=>back  to  s,  and  I  will  lock  you  all  in  again,  and  you  can  sit  there <
line 4297=>comfortably  and  think  of  a  better  plan-but  I don't suppose  I shall ever get hold of <
line 4298=>feel inclined to try." <
line 4299=><
line 4300=>####-"That  was  too  much  for  them,  and  they  calmed  down.  In  the  end,  of  course, <
line 4301=>0to do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously impossible for <
line 4302=>nd  their  way  into  the  upper  halls,  or  to  fight  their  way  out  of <
line 4303=>d  by  magic;  and  it  was  no  good  grumbling  in  the  passages  until <
line 4304=>in. So following the hobbit, down into the lowest cellars they <
line 4305=>crept.  They  passed  a  door  through which  the  chief  guard  and  the  butler  could  be <
line 4306=>seen  still  happily  snoring  with  smiles  upon  their  faces.  The  wine  of Dorwinion <
line 4307=>brings  deep  and  pleasant  dreams.  There  would  be  a  different  expression  on  the <
line 4308=>face of  the  chief guard next day,  even  though Bilbo, before  they went on,  stole  in <
line 4309=>and kindheartedly put the keys back on his belt. <
line 4310=>"That  will  save  him  some  of  the  trouble  he  is  in  for,"  said  Mr.  Baggins  to <
line 4311=>elf.  "He wasn't  a  bad  fellow,  and  quite  decent  to  the  prisoners.  It will  puzzle <
line 4312=>m all too. They will think we had a very strong magic to pass through all those <
line 4313=>d disappear. Disappear! We have got to get busy very quick, if that <
line 4314=>is to happen!" <
line 4315=> <
line 4316=>Balin was  told  off  to watch  the  guard  and  the  butler  and  give warning  if  they <
line 4317=>est went  into  the adjoining cellar with  the  trapdoors. There was  little <
line 4318=>efore  long,  as  Bilbo  knew,  some  elves were  under  orders  to  come <
line 4319=>tler get  the empty barrels  through  the doors  into  the  stream. <
line 4320=>standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be <
line 4321=>pushed off. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they <
line 4322=> opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily <
line 4323=>be  secured  ng  them  were  several  others  which  had  been  used  for <
line 4324=>bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king's palace. <
line 4325=>They  soon  found  thirteen with  room enough  for a dwarf  in each.  In  fact  some <
line 4326=>were  too  roomy,  and  as  they  climbed  in  the  dwarves  thought  anxiously  of  the <
line 4327=>shaking andhey would get  inside,  though Bilbo did his best  to  find <
line 4328=>straw  and  other  stuff  to  pack  them  in  as  cosily  as  could  be  managed  in  a  short <
line 4329=>e. At  last  twelve  dwarves were  stowed. Thorin  had  given  a  lot  of  trouble,  and <
line 4330=>turned  and  twisted  in  his  tub  and  grumbled  like  a  large  dog  in  a  small  kennel; <
line 4331=>while Balin, who came last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was <
line 4332=>stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo had done what he could to close holes in <
line 4333=>the  sides  of  the  barrels,  and  to  fix  on  all  the  lids  as  safely  as  could  be  managed, <
line 4334=> alone  again,  running  round  putting  the  finishing  touches-to <
line 4335=>the packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off. <
line 4336=><
line 4337=>####-It  had  not  been  a-bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin's lid had been <
line 4338=>fitted  on  there  came  the  sound  of  voices  and  the  flicker  of  lights.  A  number  of <
line 4339=>talking  into  the  cellars  and  singing  snatches  of  song. <
line 4340=>They had  left a merry feast  in one of  the halls and were bent on returning as soon <
line 4341=>as  they  could.  "Where's  old  Galion,  the  butler?"  said  one.  "I  haven't  seen  him  at <
line 4342=>the tables tonight. He ought to be here now to show us what is to be done." <
line 4343=>"I shall be angry  if  the old slowcoach  is  late," said another. "I have no wish  to <
line 4344=>waste time down here while the song is up!" <
line 4345=> down here while the song is up!" "Here's  the old villain with his head on a jug! He's been <
line 4346=>ng a little feast all to himself and his friend the captain." <
line 4347=>"Shake him! Wake him!" shouted the others impatiently. Gallon was not at all <
line 4348=>aken or wakened, and still  less at being  laughed at.  "You're all <
line 4349=>late," he gm I waiting and waiting down here, while you fellows <
line 4350=>drink  and  make  merry  and  forget  your  tasks.  Small  wonder  if  I  fall  asleep  from <

line 4354=>rnkey yonder. He has had his share by the looks of it." <
line 4355=>Then  they  drank  once  round  and  became  mighty  merry  all  of  a  sudden.  But <
line 4356=>0e  lose  their wits. "Save us, Galion!" cried some, "you began your <
line 4357=>feasting  eed  your  wits!  You  have  stacked  some  full  casks  here <
line 4358=>instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight." <
line 4359=>"Get on with the work!" growled the butler. "There is nothing in the feeling of <
line 4360=>  toss-pot's  arms. These  are  the ones  to go  and no others. Do  as  I <
line 4361=>say!"very  well,"  they  answered  rolling  the  barrels  to  the  opening.  "On <

line 4368=>So  they  sang as  first one barrel and  then another  rumbled  to  the dark opening <
line 4369=>hed  over  into  the  cold  water  some  feet  below.  Some  were  barrels <
line 4370=>really empty, some were  tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each; but down  they all <
line 4371=>went,  one  after  another, with many  a  clash  and  a  bump,  thudding  on  top  of  ones <
line 4372=><
line 4373=>####-below,  smacking  into  the water,  jostling against  the walls of  the  tunnel, knocking <
line 4374=>into one another, and bobbing away down the current. <
line 4375=>It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his <
line 4376=> it  some  time  ago  and have been  laughing  at him; but I <
line 4377=>don't suppose you would have done half as well yourselves in his place. Of course <
line 4378=>a barrel himself, nor was  there anyone  to pack him  in, even  if  there <
line 4379=>had  been  a  chance!  It  looked  as  if  he  would  certainly  lose  his  friends  this  time <
line 4380=>(nearly  all  of  them  had  already  disappeared  through  the  dark  trap-door), and get <
line 4381=>utterly left behind and have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-caves <
line 4382=>r ever. For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at once, he had <
line 4383=>precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again. He did not know the way <
line 4384=>re  the barrels were collected. He wondered what on earth <
line 4385=>would happen to them without him; for he had not had time to tell the dwarves all <
line 4386=>rned,  or what he had meant  to do, once  they were out of  the wood. <
line 4387=>While  alts  were  passing  through  his  mind,  the  elves  being  very <

line 4389=>on  the  ropes  which  pulled  up  the  portcullis  at  the  water-gate  so  as  to  let  out  the <

line 4419=>knowing what  else  to  do,  poor  little Bilbo  caught hold of  it  and was pushed over <
line 4420=>the edge with it. Down into the water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water with <
line 4421=>the  barrel  on  top  of  him. He  came  up  again  spluttering  and  clinging  to  the wood <
line 4422=>likor all his efforts he could not scramble on top. Every time he tried, <
line 4423=>0d  and  ducked  him  under  again.  It  was  really  empty,  and <
line 4424=>h his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves <
line 4425=>inging  in  the  cellar  above.  Then  suddenly  the  trapdoors  fell  to with a boom <
line 4426=>and  their  voices  faded  away. He was  in  the  dark  tunnel,  floating  in  icy water,  all <
line 4427=>alone-for you cannot count friends that are all packed up in barrels. <
line 4428=>Very  soon a grey patch came up  in  the darkness ahead. He heard  the creak of <
line 4429=>the water-gate being hauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing <
line 4430=> and  tubs  all  pressing  together  to  pass  under  the  arch <
line 4431=>and  get  out  into  the  open  stream.  He  had  as  much  as  he  could  do  to  prevent <
line 4432=>self  from  being  hustled  and  battered  to  bits;  but  at  last  the  jostling  crowd <
line 4433=>began to break up and swing off, one by one, under the stone arch and away. Then <
line 4434=>he saw  that  it would have been no good even  if he had managed  to get astride his <
line 4435=>barrel,  for  there was  no  room  to  spare, not  even  for  a hobbit, between  its  top  and <
line 4436=>ere the gate was. <

line 4442=>ut  the  lids on  tight enough!" he  thought, but before  long he was <
line 4443=>0  himself  to remember  the dwarves. He managed  to keep <
line 4444=>his head  above  the water, but he was  shivering with  the  cold,  and he wondered  if <
line 4445=>he would die of  it before  the  luck  turned, and how much  longer he would be able <
line 4446=>to hang on, and whether he should risk the chance of  letting go and trying to swim <
line 4447=> the bank. <
line 4448=>ned  all  right  before  long:  the  eddying  current  carried  several <
line 4449=> at  one  point  and  there  for  a  while  they  stuck  against  some <
line 4450=>bo  took  the  opportunity  of  scrambling  up  the  side  of  his <
line 4451=>barrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled like a drowned rat, <
line 4452=>and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could. The breeze was <
line 4453=>cold  but  better  than  the water,  and  he  hoped  he would  not  suddenly  roll off again <
line 4454=>ff  once  more.  Before  long  the  barrels  broke  free  again  and <
line 4455=> down  the  stream,  and  out  into  the  main  current  Then  he <
line 4456=>found it quito stick on as he had feared; but he managed it somehow, <
line 4457=>though  it was miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very  light, and  the barrel <
line 4458=> one  and  being  rather  leaky  had  now  shipped  a  small  amount  of <
line 4459=>water. it was  like  trying  to  ride, without  bridle  or  stirrups,  a  round-<

line 4465=>on  itace  there were  dancing  and  broken  reflections  of  clouds  and  of <
line 4466=>ng water of  the Forest River swept all the company of casks <
line 4467=>and tubs away to the north bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. This had a <
line 4468=> under  hanging  banks  and  was  walled  at  the  eastern  end  by  a  little <
line 4469=>jutting  cape  of  hard  rock.  On  the  shallow  shore  most  of  the barrels  ran  aground, <

line 4472=>pushed all the barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted them <
line 4473=>they  roped  them  together and left them till the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo was <
line 4474=>not  so  badly  off  now.  He  slipped  from  his  barrel  and  waded  ashore,  and  then <
line 4475=>sneaked  along  to  some huts  that he  could  see near  the water's  edge. He no  longer <

line 4478=>really  hungry,  not merely  politely  interested  in  the  dainties  of  a well-filled larder. <
line 4479=>Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire  through  the  trees, and that appealed to him <
line 4480=>with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.  <

line 4485=>0t,  but  he was  given  away  in  the  end  by  his wet  footsteps  and  the <
line 4486=> that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he began to snivel, <
line 4487=>o  hide  he  was  found  out  by  the  terrific  explosions  of  his <
line 4488=>  soon  there  was  a  fine  commotion  in  the  village  by  the <
line 4489=> into  the woods carrying a  loaf and a  leather bottle of <
line 4490=>wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of the night he had to pass wet <
line 4491=>ar from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually <
line 4492=>dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was getting late and the air <

line 4495=>there was a merry racket down by the river. They were making up a raft of barrels, <

line 4497=>Bilbo  sneezed  again.  He  was  no  longer  dripping  but  he  felt  cold  all  over.  He <
line 4498=>scrambled down as  fast as his  stiff  legs would  take him and managed  just  in  time <
line 4499=>0o get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle. Luckily <
line 4500=>there was  no  sun  at  the  time  to  cast  an  awkward  shadow,  and  for  a mercy he did <
line 4501=>not sneeze again for a good while. <

line 4507=>ried the raftman. "Shove off!" t, slowly at first, until they had passed the point of rock <
line 4508=>where other elves stood  to fend  them off with poles, and  then quicker and quicker <

line 4521=>Suddenly  the  cliff  fell  away. The  shores  sank. The  trees  ended. Then Bilbo  saw  a <
line 4522=>sight: The  lands opened wide  about him,  filled with  the waters of  the  river which <
line 4523=>wandered  in  a  hundred  winding  courses,  or  halted  in  marshes  and <
line 4524=>pools  dotted  with  isles  on  every  side:  but  still  a  strong  water  flowed  on  steadily <
line 4525=>through  the midst. And  far  away,  its  dark  head  in  a  torn  cloud,  there  loomed  the <
line 4526=>est  neighbours  to  the  North-East  and  the  tumbled  land  that <
line 4527=>joined it to them could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked across the marshes <
line 4528=>to  the  forest.  The  Lonely  Mountain!  Bilbo  had  come  far  and  through  many <
line 4529=>e it, and now he did not like the look of it in the least. <
line 4530=>As  he  listened  to  the  talk  of  the  raftmen  and  pieced  together  the  scraps  of <
line 4531=>information  they  let  fall, he  soon  realized  that he was very  fortunate  ever  to have <
line 4532=>seen  it  at  all,  even  from  this  distance.  Dreary  as  had  been  his  imprisonment and <
line 4533=>unpleasant  as  was  his  position  (to  say  nothing  of  the  poor  dwarves  underneath <
line 4534=>him)  still,  he  had  been  more  lucky  than  he  had  guessed.  The  talk  was  all  of  the <
line 4535=>trade  that  came  and  went  on  the  waterways  and  the  growth  of  the  traffic  on  the <
line 4536=>0oads out of  the East  towards Mirkwood vanished or  fell  into disuse; <
line 4537=>and of the bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood-elves about the upkeep of the <
line 4538=>Forest River and the care of the banks. <
line 4539=>st River and the care of the banks. much  since  the  days  when  dwarves  dwelt  in  the <
line 4540=>0  days  which  most  people  now  remembered  only  as  a  very  shadowy <
line 4541=> changed  even  in  recent  years,  and  since  the  last  news  that <

line 4544=>to attribute to the dragon-alluding to him chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod <
line 4545=>  of  the  Mountain).  The  marshes  and  bogs  had  spread  wider  and <
line 4546=>wider  .  Paths  had  vanished,  and many  a  rider  and wanderer  too,  if <
line 4547=>  the  lost  ways  across.  The  elf-road  through  the wood which <

line 4552=>beyond, and the river was guarded by the Wood-elves' king. <
line 4553=>So  you  see Bilbo  had  come  in  the  end  by  the  only  road  that was  any  good.  It <
line 4554=>  some  comfort  to Mr. Baggins  shivering on  the barrels,  if he had <
line 4555=>his  had  reached  Gandalf  far  away  and  given  him  great <
line 4556=>anxiety, and  that he was  in  fact  finishing his other business  (which does not come <
line 4557=>into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin's company. But Bilbo <
line 4558=>did not know it. <
line 4559=>All he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he <
line 4560=>had  a  nasty  cold  in  the  nose,  and  did  not  like  the  way  the <
line 4561=>Mountain at him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. After a <
line 4562=>while, however,  the  river  took a more southerly course and  the Mountain  receded <
line 4563=>  last,  late  in  the  day  the  shores  grew  rocky,  the  river  gathered  all  its <
line 4564=>wandering  waters  together  into  a  deep  and  rapid  flood,  and  they  swept  along  at <
line 4565=>great speed. <
line 4566=>ng with another  sweep  towards  the East  the  forest-<
line 4567=>ushed  into  the  Long  Lake.  There  it  had  a  wide  mouth  with  stony  clifflike <
line 4568=>gates at either side whose feet were piled with shingles. The Long Lake! Bilbo had <
line 4569=>  any  water  that  was  not  the  sea  could  look  so  big.  It  was  so <
line 4570=>osite  shores  looked  small  and  far,  but  it  was  so  long  that  its <
line 4571=> pointed towards the Mountain, could not be  seen at all. Only <
line 4572=>from the map did Bilbo know that away up there, where the stars of the Wain were <
line 4573=>already  twinkling,  the  Running  River  came  down  into  the  lake  from  Dale  and <
line 4574=>with  the  Forest  River  filled  with  deep  waters  what  must  once  have  been  a  great <
line 4575=>deep  ro the  southern  end  the  doubled waters  poured  out  again  over <
line 4576=>way  hurriedly  to  unknown  lands.  In  the  still  evening  air <

line 4578=>Not  far  from  the mouth  of  the Forest River was the strange town he heard the <
line 4579=>elves speak of in the king's cellars. It was not built on the shore, though there were <
line 4580=>a  few  huts  and  buildings  there,  but  right  out  on  the  surface  of  the  lake,  protected <
line 4581=>0f  the entering river by a promontory of rock which formed a calm <
line 4582=>bay. A great  . bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles made of forest <
line 4583=>trees  was  built  a  busy  wooden  town,  not  a  town  of  elves  but  of  Men,  who  still <
line 4584=>dared  to  dwell  here  under  the  shadow  of  the  distant  dragon-mountain. They  still <
line 4585=>throve  on  the  trade  that  came  up  the  great  river  from  the  South  and  was  carted <
line 4586=>  to  their  town;  but  in  the  great  days  of  old,  when  Dale  in  the  North <
line 4587=>was rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and powerful, and there had been <
line 4588=><
line 4589=>####-fleets  of  boats  on  the  waters,  and  some  were  filled  with  gold  and  some  with <
line 4590=>warriors  in  armour,  and  there  had  been  wars  and  deeds  which  were  now  only  a <
line 4591=>legend.  The  rotting  piles  of  a  greater  town  could  still  be  seen  along  the  shores <
line 4592=>ght. <
line 4593=>But men  remembered  little of  all  that,  though  some  still  sang old  songs of  the <
line 4594=>dwarf-kings  of  the Mountain,  Thror  and  Thrain  of  the  race  of  Durin,  and  of  the <
line 4595=>ing of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale. Some sang too that Thror <
line 4596=>  come  back  one  day  and  gold would  flow  in  rivers  through  the <
line 4597=>mountai that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. <
line 4598=>But this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business. <
line 4599=> <
line 4600=>arrels  came  in  sight boats  rowed out  from  the piles of <
line 4601=>the  town,  and  voices  hailed  the  raft-steerers. Then  ropes were  cast  and oars were <
line 4602=>pulled,  and  soon  the  raft  was  drawn  out  of  the  current  of  the  Forest  River  and <
line 4603=>towed  away  round  the  high  shoulder  of  rock  into  the  little  bay  of  Lake-town. <
line 4604=>There  it  was  moored  not  far  from  the  shoreward  head  of  the  great  bridge.  Soon <

line 4606=>they would fill with goods they had brought to be taken back up the stream to the <

line 4615=>and a savage look like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a kennel for a <
line 4616=>week.  It was Thorin,  but  you  could  only  have  told  it  by his golden chain, and by <
line 4617=>  now  dirty  and  tattered  sky-blue  hood  with  its  tarnished  silver <
line 4618=>ime before he would be even polite to the hobbit. <
line 4619=>"Well,  are  you  alive  or  are  you  dead?"  asked  Bilbo  quite  crossly.  Perhaps  he <

line 4621=>also  the   and  legs, not  to  speak of  a greater  allowance of  air.  "Are <

line 4689=>said  the  captain,  and with  six men  about  them he  led  them <

line 4691=>a  wide  circle  of  quiet  water  surrounded  by  the  tall  piles  on  which  were  built  the <
line 4692=>greater  houses,  and  by  long  wooden  quays  with  many  steps  and  ladders  going <
line 4693=>down  to  the  surface  of  the  lake. From  one  great  hall  shone many  lights  and  there <
line 4694=>came  the  sound  of many  voices.  They  passed  its  doors  and  stood  blinking  in  the <

line 4700=>lower enressing forward before the Master's table they cried: <
line 4701=>"These  are  prisoners  of  our  king  that  have  escaped,  wandering  vagabond <

line 4703=>woods and molesting our people!" <
line 4704=>e!"   this  true?"  asked  the  Master.  As  a  matter  of  fact  he  thought  it  far  more <
line 4705=>likely than the return of the King under the Mountain, if any such person had ever <
line 4706=>existed. <
line 4707=>"It  is  true  that we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elven-king and imprisoned <
line 4708=> journeyed  back  to  our  own  land,"  answered  Thorin.  "But <

line 4710=>Wood-elves' realm. I speak to the Master of the town of the Men of the lake, not to <

line 4712=>Then  the  Master  hesitated  and  looked  from  one  to  the  other.  The  Elvenking <
line 4713=>was  very  powerful  in  those  parts  and  the Master wished  for  no  enmity with  him, <
line 4714=>nor did he  thsongs, giving his mind  to  .trade and tolls, to cargoes <
line 4715=>and  gold,  to  which  habit  he  owed  his  position.  Others  were  of  different  mind, <
line 4716=>however,  and  quickly  the  matter  was  settled  without  him.  The  news  had  spread <
line 4717=>from  the  doors  of  the  hall  like  fire  through  all  the  town.  People  were  shouting <
line 4718=>i  and  outside  it. The  quays were  thronged with  hurrying  feet.  Some <
line 4719=>ches  of  old  songs  concerning  the  return  of  the  King  under  the <
line 4720=>s Thror's grandson not Thror himself  that had come back did <
line 4721=>t bother them at all. Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over the <
line 4722=>lake. <

line 4743=>ell as  the music of harps and of  fiddles mixed up with  it. <
line 4744=>Indeed  such  excitement  had  not  been  known  in  the  town  in  the  memory  of  the <
line 4745=>oldest  grandfather. The Wood-elves  themselves began  to wonder greatly and even <
line 4746=>to  be  afraid.  They  did  not  know  of  course  how  Thorin  had  escaped,  and  they <
line 4747=>began to tmight have made a serious mistake. As for the Master he <
line 4748=>saw  there was nothing else for  it but  to obey  the general clamour, for  the moment <
line 4749=>d to pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said. So he gave up <
line 4750=>to  him  his  own  great  chair  and  set  Fili  and  Kili  beside  him  in  places  of  honour.  <
line 4751=>Even  Bilbo  was  given  a  seat  at  the  high  table,  and  no  explanation  of  where  he <
line 4752=>came  in-no  songs  had  alluded  to  him  even  in  the  obscurest way-was asked  for  in <
line 4753=>the general burwards  the other dwarves were brought  into  the  town amid scenes of <
line 4754=>astonishing enthusiasm. They were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered <
line 4755=>in  the  most  delightful  and  satisfactory  fashion.  A  large  house  was  given  up  to <
line 4756=>Thorin  and  his  company;  boats  and  rowers were  put  at  their  service;  and  crowds <
line 4757=> sang  songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed so much as his <
line 4758=>nose. <
line 4759=>Some of the songs were old ones; but some of them were quite new and spoke <
line 4760=>confidently  of  the  sudden  death  of  the  dragon  and  of  cargoes  of  rich  presents <
line 4761=>coming  down  the  river  to  Lake-town.  These were  inspired  largely  by  the Master <
line 4762=>and  they  did  not  particularly  please  the  dwarves,  but  in  the  meantime  they  were <
line 4763=>well  they  quickly  grew  fat  and  strong  again.  Indeed within  a week <
line 4764=>0red,  fitted  out  in  fine  cloth  of  their  proper  colours,  with <

line 4766=>0as already regained and Smaug chopped up into little pieces. <
line 4767=>en,  as he had  said,  the dwarves' good  feeling  towards  the  little hobbit grew <
line 4768=>stronger  every  day.  There  were  no  more  groans  or  grumbles.  They  drank  his <
line 4769=>health, and they patted him on the back, and they made a great fuss of him; which <
line 4770=>0as just as well, for he was not feeling particularly cheerful. He had not forgotten <
line 4771=>the  look  of  the  Mountain,  nor  the  thought  of  the  dragon,  and  he  had  besides  a <
line 4772=><
line 4773=>####-shocking  cold.  For  three  days  he  sneezed  and  coughed,  and  he  could  not  go  out, <
line 4774=>and even after that his speeches at banquets were limited to "Thag you very buch." <
line 4775=>e Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with their <
line 4776=>cargoes,  and  there  was  great  excitement  in  the  king's  palace.  I  have  never  heard <
line 4777=>what  happened  to  the  chief  of  the  guards  and  the  butler.  Nothing  of  course  was <
line 4778=>ever said about keys or barrels while  the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and Bilbo <
line 4779=>become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was <
line 4780=>0nown, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In any case the <
line 4781=>he dwarves' errand, or thought he did, and he said to himself: <
line 4782=>"Very well! We'll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood without <
line 4783=>to say in the matter. But I expect they will all come to a bad <
line 4784=>end, and serve them right!" He at any rate did not believe in dwarves fighting and <
line 4785=>killing  dragons  like  Smaug,  and  he  strongly  suspected  attempted  burglary  or <
line 4786=>something  like  it  which  shows  he  was  a  wise  elf  and  wiser  than  the  men  of  the <
line 4787=>town,  right, as we shall see in the end. He sent out his spies about <
line 4788=>  as  far northward  towards  the Mountains  as  they would <
line 4789=>go, and waited. <
line 4790=>a  fortnight  Thorin  began  to  think  of  departure.  While  the <
line 4791=>enthusiasm  still  lasted  in  the  town was  the  time  to get help.  It would not do  to  let <
line 4792=>everything  cool  down  with  delay.  So  he  spoke  to  the  Master  and  his  councillors <
line 4793=>and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the Mountain. <
line 4794=>ime  the Master was surprised and a  little frightened; and he <
line 4795=>wondered  if  Thorin  was  after  all  really  a  descendant  of  the  old  kings.  He  had <
line 4796=>never  thought  that  the  dwarves  would  actually  dare  to  approach  Smaug,  but <
line 4797=>believed  they were  frauds who would sooner or  later be discovered and be  turned <
line 4798=>n, of  course, was  really  the grandson of  the King under <
line 4799=>  Mountain,  and  there  is  no  knowing  what  a  dwarf  will  not  dare  and  do  for <
line 4800=>revenge or the recovery of his own. But the Master was not sorry at all to let them <
line 4801=>xpensive  to  keep,  and  their  arrival  had  turned  things  into  a  long <
line 4802=>usiness was at a standstill. <
line 4803=>"Let them go and bother Smaug, and see how he welcomes them!" he thought. <
line 4804=> Thrain's  son  Thror's  son!"  was  what  he  said.  "You  must <
line 4805=>t hand, spoken of old. What help we can offer shall <
line 4806=>be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is regained." <
line 4807=>So  one  day,  although  autumn  was  now  getting  far  on,  and  winds  were  cold, <
line 4808=>and  leaves  were  falling  fast,  three  large  boats  left  Lake-town,  laden with  rowers, <
line 4809=><
line 4810=>####-dwarves,  Mr.  Baggins,  and  many  provisions.  Horses  and  ponies  had  been  sent <
line 4811=>cuitous  paths  to  meet  them  at  their  appointed  landing-place.  The <
line 4812=>ncillors  bade  them  farewell  from  the  great  steps  of  the  town-<
line 4813=>to  the  lake.  People  sang  on  the  quays  and  out  of  windows. <
line 4814=>and  splashed,  and  off  they  went  north  up  the  lake  on  the <
line 4815=>urney. The only person thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo. <

line 4822=>River  Running,  and  now  they  could  all  see  the  Lonely  Mountain  towering  grim <
line 4823=> tall  before  them.  The  stream was  strong  and  their  going  slow. At  the;  end  of <
line 4824=>the third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or western bank and <
line 4825=>disembarked.  Here  they  were  joined  by  the  horses  with  other  provisions  and <
line 4826=>es for their own use that had been sent to meet them. They <
line 4827=>ed what  they  could  on  the  ponies  and  the  rest was made  into  a  store under  a <
line 4828=>tent,  but  none  of  the men  of  the  town would  stay with  them  even  for  the  night  so <
line 4829=>near the shadow of the Mountain. <

line 4831=>believe in the Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild parts. Indeed <
line 4832=>0no need of any guard, for all  the  land was desolate and empty. So <
line 4833=>their escort  left  them, making off  swiftly down  the  river and  the  shoreward paths, <
line 4834=>although the night was already drawing on. <
line 4835=> night was already drawing on. d  lonely night and  their spirits  fell. The next day  they set <
line 4836=>out  again. Balin  and Bilbo  rode  behind,  each  leading  another  pony  heavily  laden <
line 4837=>beside  him;  the  others  were  some  way  ahead  picking  out  a  slow  road,  for  there <
line 4838=>were no paths. They made north-west, slanting away from the River Running, and <
line 4839=>drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Mountain that was flung out <
line 4840=>thwards towards them. <

line 4860=>Balin  and Fili  and Kili,  and with  them went Bilbo. They marched under  the grey <
line 4861=> feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a wide loop <
line 4862=>over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the Lake, flowing <

line 4892=>without  hope  of  further  help. They were  at  the  end  of  their  journey,  but  as  far  as <
line 4893=>the end of their quest. None of them had much spirit left. <
line 4894=>Now  strange  to  say  Mr.  Baggins  had  more  than  the  others.  He  would  often <
line 4895=>borrow Thorin's map  and  gaze  at  it,  pondering over  the  runes and  the message of <
line 4896=>the  moon-letters  Elrond  had  read.  It  was  he  that  made  the  dwarves  begin  the <
line 4897=>dangerous   western  slopes  for  the  secret  door.  They  moved  their <

line 4910=>stood  alone  like  a  pillar,  Bilbo  came  on  what  looked  like  rough  steps  going <
line 4911=>upwards.  Following  these  excitedly  he  and  the dwarves  found  traces of  a narrow <
line 4912=>often  rediscovered,  that  wandered  on  to  the  top  of  the  southern <
line 4913=>ridge and brought them at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across <
line 4914=>the  face of  the Mountain. Looking down  they  saw  that they were at the top of the <
line 4915=>cliff  at  the  valley's  head  and  were  gazing  down  on  to  their  own  camp  below. <
line 4916=>ging to the rocky wall on their right, they went in single file along the <
line 4917=>ll  opened  and  they  turned  into  a  little  steep-walled  bay,  grassy-<
line 4918=>floo quiet.  Its  entrance which  they had  found  could not be  seen  from <
line 4919=>verhang of  the  cliff, nor  from  further off because  it was  so <
line 4920=>dark crack and no more. It was not a cave and was open <
line 4921=>to  the  sky  above;  but  at  its  inner  end  a  flat  wall  rose  up  that  in  the  lower  I  part, <

line 4954=>without  resting  to  discover where  exactly  in  the  smooth  face  of  the  rock  the  door <

line 4956=> they  tried  to  use  these.  But  when  they  struck  the  stone  the  handles <

line 4961=>of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space between the <
line 4962=>wall  and  the  opening  the  "doorstep"  in  fun,  remembering Bilbo's words  long  ago <
line 4963=>d  party  in  his  hobbit-hole,  when  he  said  they  could  sit  on  the <
line 4964=>  thought  of  something.  And  sit  and  think  they  did,  or  wandered <
line 4965=>aimlessly about, and glummer and glummer they became. <
line 4966=>Their  spirits  had  risen  a  little  at  the  discovery  of  the path, but now  they  sank <
line 4967=>into their boots; and yet they would not give it up and go away. The hobbit was no <
line 4968=>brighter than the dwarves. He would do nothing but sit with his back <
line 4969=>tare  away west  through  the opening, over  the cliff, over  the <
line 4970=>wide  lands  ll of Mirkwood,  and  to  the distances beyond,  in which <
line 4971=>he  sometimes  thought  he  could  catch  glimpses  of  the Misty Mountains  small  and <
line 4972=>far. If the dwarves asked him what he was doing he answered: <
line 4973=>"You  said  sitting  on  the  doorstep  and  thinking  would  be  my  job,  not  to <
line 4974=>0  so  I  am  sitting  and  thinking." But  I  am  afraid  he was  not <
line 4975=>thinking job,  but  of  what  lay  beyond  the  blue  distance,  the  quiet <
line 4976=> and  his  hobbit-hole under  it. A  large grey  stone  lay  in <
line 4977=>stared moodily at it or watched the great snails. They <
line 4978=>seemed  to  love  the  little  shut-in  bay  with  its  walls  of  cool  rock,  and  there  were <
line 4979=>many of them of huge size crawling slowly and stickily along its sides. <

line 4998=><
line 4999=>####-had  a  queer  feeling  that  he  was  waiting  for  something.  "Perhaps  the  wizard  will <
line 5000=>suddenly come back today," he thought. <

line 5002=>gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light caught the <
line 5003=>last pale  leaves. Soon he  saw  the orange ball of  the  sun  sinking  towards  the  level <
line 5004=>of his eyes. He went  to  the opening and  there pale and faint was a  thin new moon <
line 5005=>above  the  rim  of Earth. At  that  very moment  he  heard  a  sharp crack behind him. <
line 5006=>There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its <
line 5007=>pale  yellow  breast  freckled  dark  spots.  Crack!  It  had  caught  a  snail  and  was <
line 5008=>ing it on the stone. Crack! Crack! <
line 5009=>it on the stone. Crack! Crack!   Forgetting  all  danger  he  stood  on  the  ledge  and <
line 5010=>hailed  the  dwarves,  shouting  and  paying. Those  that were  nearest  came  tumbling <
line 5011=>over the rocks and as fast as they could along the ledge to him, wondering what on <
line 5012=>earth  was  the  matter;  the  others  shouted  to  be  hauled  up  the  ropes  (except <
line 5013=>p). <
line 5014=> They  all  fell  silent:  the  hobbit  standing  by  the  grey <
line 5015=>wagging  beards watching  impatiently.  The  sun  sank <
line 5016=>lower  and  lower,  and  their  hopes  fell.  It  sank  into  a  belt  of  reddened  cloud  and <
line 5017=>ared.  The  dwarves  groaned,  but  still  Bilbo  stood  almost  without  moving. <
line 5018=>The  little  moon  was  dipping  to  the  horizon.  Evening  was  coming  on.  Then <
line 5019=>suddenly  when  their  hope  was  lowest  a  red  ray  of  the  sun  escaped  like  a  finger <
line 5020=>through    cloud.  A  gleam  of  light  came  straight  through  the  opening <
line 5021=> on  the  smooth  rock-face.  The  old  thrush,  who  had  been <
line 5022=> beady eyes and head cocked on one side, gave a <

line 5024=> suddenly  about  three  feet  from  the  ground.  Quickly,  trembling <

line 5034=>Long straight cracks appeared and widened. A door five feet high and three broad <

line 5047=>good  companion  on  our  long  road,  and  a  hobbit  full  of  courage and  resource  far <

line 5049=>usual  allowance-now  is  the  time  for  him  to  perform  the  service  for which  he was <
line 5050=>included in our Company; now is the time for him to earn his Reward." <
line 5051=>You are  familiar with Thorin's style on  important occasions, so  I will not give <
line 5052=> of  it,  though  he  went  on  a  good  deal  longer  than  this.  It  certainly <
line 5053=>was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar <
line 5054=>ew what be was driving at. <
line 5055=>"If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O Thorin <
line 5056=>Thrain's son Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer," he said crossly, "say <

line 5087=>on  his  ring,  and warned  by  the  echoes  to  take more  than hobbit's care to make no <
line 5088=>oiselessly  down,  down,  down  into  the  dark.  He  was  trembling <
line 5089=>with  fear,  but  his  little  face  was  set  and  grim.  Already  he  was  a  very  different <
line 5090=>hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief from Bag-End <
line 5091=>long  ago. He had not had  a pocket-handkerchief for ages. He loosened his dagger <

line 5093=> <
line 5094=>"Now  you  are  in  for  it  at  last, Bilbo Baggins,"  he  said  to  himself.  "You went <

line 5102=>that a kind of a glow I seem to see coming right ahead <
line 5103=>down  there?"  he  thought.  It was. As  he went  forward  it  grew  and  grew,  till  there <
line 5104=>was no doubt about it. It was a red light steadily getting redder and redder. Also it <
line 5105=>was  now  undoubtedly  hot  in  the  tunnel. Wisps of vapour  floated up and past him <
line 5106=>and he begannd, too, began to throb in his ears, a sort of bubbling <
line 5107=>like  the  noise  of  a  large  pot  galloping  on  the  fire,  mixed  with  a  rumble  as  of  a <
line 5108=>ntic  tom-cat  purring.  This  grew  to  the  unmistakable  gurgling  noise  of  some <
line 5109=>vast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him. <
line 5110=>  It  was  at  this  point  that  Bilbo  stopped.  Going  on  from  there  was  the  bravest <
line 5111=>thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterward were as nothing <
line 5112=><
line 5113=>####-compared  to  it.  He  fought  the  real  battle  in  the  tunnel  alone,  before  he  ever  saw <
line 5114=>the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you <
line 5115=>can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, an opening of much the same size <
line 5116=>and shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit's little head. Before him <
line 5117=>lies the great bottommost cellar or dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the <
line 5118=>ot.  It  is  almost  dark  so  that  its  vastaess  can  only  be  dimly  guessed, <
line 5119=>but  rising  from  the near side of  the  rocky  floor  there  is a great glow. The glow of <

line 5122=>There  he  lay,  a  vast  red-golden dragon, fast asleep;  thrumming came from his <

line 5125=>  unseen  floors,  lay  countless  piles  of  precious  things, <
line 5126=>s and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy <
line 5127=>light. <

line 5134=>away  is  no  description  at  all.  There  are  no words  left  to express his  staggerment, <
line 5135=>since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the <
line 5136=>world was wonderful.  Bilbo  had  heard  tell  and  sing  of  dragon-hoards before, but <
line 5137=>the spl, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. <
line 5138=>His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; <

line 5145=>one  fearful  eye  upwards. Smaug  stirred  a wing,  opened  a  claw,  the  rumble  of  his <
line 5146=>0ts note. <
line 5147=>t  the  dragon  did  not  wake-not  yet  but  shifted  into  other <
line 5148=>ence,  lying  there  in  his  stolen  hall while  the  little hobbit <

line 5150=>as going down, but still he clutched the cup, and his <
line 5151=>chief  thought was:  "I've  done  it! This will  show  them.  'More  like  a grocer  than  a <
line 5152=>burglar' indeed! Well, we'll hear no more of that." <
line 5153=>Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he <
line 5154=>surprised.  He  picked  Bilbo  up  and  carried  him  out  into  the  open  air.  It  was <
line 5155=>midnight  and  clouds  had  covered  the  stars,  but  Bilbo  lay  with  his  eyes  shut, <
line 5156=>gasping  and  taking pleasure  in  the  feel of  the  fresh  air  again,  and hardly noticing <
line 5157=>the  excitement  of  the  dwarves,  or  how  they  praised  him  and  patted  him  on  the <

line 5166=>in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the <

line 5168=>Then  the  dwarves  forgot  their  joy  and  their  confident  boasts  of  a  moment <

line 5175=>unpleasantly)  to  a  doze,  and  from  a  doze  to wide waking.  There was  a  breath  of <
line 5176=>strange  air  in  his  cave.  Could  there  be  a  draught  from  that  little  hole?  He  had <
line 5177=>0  about  it,  though  was  so  small,  and  now  he  glared  at  it  in <
line 5178=>suspicion an wondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied <
line 5179=>he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above that came down <
line 5180=>  lair.  He  stirred  and  stretched  forth  his  neck  to  sniff.  Then  he <
line 5181=>                                    <
line 5182=>                               ch  a  thing  had  not  happened  since  first  he  came  to <
line 5183=>the Mountain! His rage passes description â€“ the sort of rage that is only seen when <
line 5184=>rich  folk  that  have  more  than  they  can  enjoy  suddenly  lose  something  that  they <
line 5185=>have  long  had  but  have  never  before  used  or  wanted.  His  fire  belched  forth,  the <
line 5186=><
line 5187=>####-hall  smoked,  he  shook  the mountain-roots. He  thrust his head  in vain  at  the  little <
line 5188=>hole,  and  then  coiling  his  length  together,  roaring  like  thunder  underground,  he <
line 5189=>  deep  lair  through  its  great  door,  out  into  the  huge  passages  of  the <

line 5192=>trampled  him  was  his  one  thought.  He  issued  from  the  Gate,  the  waters  rose  in <
line 5193=>fierce  whistling  steam,  and  up  he  soared  blazing  into  the  air  and  settled  on  the <
line 5194=>mountain-top  in  a  spout of green  and  scarlet  flame. The dwarves heard  the  awful <
line 5195=>rumour  of  his  flight,  and  they  crouched  against  the  walls  of  the  grassy  terrace <
line 5196=>0boulders,  hoping  somehow  to  escape  the  frightful  eyes  of  the <

line 5202=>"They will be slain, and all our ponies too, and all out stores lost," moaned the <
line 5203=>others. "We can do nothing." <
line 5204=>"Nonsense!"  said  Thorin,  recovering  his  dignity.  "We  cannot  leave  them.  Get <
line 5205=>inside Mr. Baggins and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili-the dragon shan't have all <

line 5207=>here are the ropes? Be quick!" he  worst  moments  they  had  been  through  yet.  The <
line 5208=>horrible sounds of Smaug's anger were echoing  in  the stony hollows  far above; at <
line 5209=>anight  come  blazing  down  or  fly  whirling  round  and  find  them <
line 5210=>s  cliff's  edge  hauling  madly  on  the  ropes.  Up  came  Bofur, <
line 5211=>and  still  all  was  safe.  Up  came  Bombur,  puffing  and  blowing  while  the  ropes <
line 5212=>creaked, and still all was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and then <
line 5213=>danger was upon them. A whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points <
line 5214=> dragon  came.  They  had  barely  time  to  fly  back  to  the <
line 5215=> their bundles, when Smaug came hurtling from the <
line 5216=>North, licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating his great wings with a noise <
line 5217=>0hot breath shrivelled  the grass before  the door, and drove <
line 5218=>in  through  the  crack  they  had  left  and  scorched  them  as  they  lay  hid.  Flickering <
line 5219=>fires  leaped  up  and  black  rock-shadows  danced.  Then  darkness  fell  as  he  passed <
line 5220=>again. <
line 5221=>The ponies screamed with terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. The <
line 5222=>dragon swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone. <

line 5224=>our poor beasts!" said Thorin. Smaug  once  he  sees  it.  Here  we  are  and  here  we  shall <
line 5225=>ncies tramping the long open miles back to the river <
line 5226=>with Smaug on the watch!" <
line 5227=>It  was  not  a  pleasant  thought!  They  crept  further  down  the  tunnel,  and  there <
line 5228=>ered  though  it  was  warm  and  stuffy,  until  dawn  came  pale <
line 5229=>  door. Every  now  and  again  through  the  night  they  could <
line 5230=>hear the roar agon grow and then pass and fade, as he hunted round <
line 5231=>and round the mountain-sides. <
line 5232=>He  guessed  from  the  ponies,  and  from  the  traces  of  the  camps  he  had <
line 5233=>0  come up  from  the  river  and  the  lake  and had  scaled  the <
line 5234=>ley  where  the  ponies  had  been  standing;  but  the  door <
line 5235=>withstood his searching eye, and the little high-walled bay had kept out his fiercest <
line 5236=>flames.  Long  he  had  hunted  in  vain  till  the  dawn  chilled  his  wrath  and  he  went <
line 5237=>back to his golden couch to sleep â€“ and to gather new strength. <
line 5238=>He would not  forget or  forgive  the  theft, not  if a  thousand years turned him to <
line 5239=>0e,  but  he  could  afford  to  wait.  Slow  and  silent  he  crept  back  to <
line 5240=>his lair and half closed his eyes. <
line 5241=>losed his eyes.   came  the  terror  of  the  dwarves  grew  less.  They  realized  that <
line 5242=>dangers  of  this  kind  were  inevitable  in  dealing  with  such  a  guardian,  and  that  it <
line 5243=>  up  their  quest  yet.  Nor  could  they  get  away  just  now,  as <
line 5244=>Thorin  had  pointed  out. Their  ponies were  lost  or  killed,  and  they would  have  to <
line 5245=>wait  some  time  before  Smaug  relaxed  his  watch  sufficiently  for  them  to dare  the <
line 5246=>long way on  foot. Luckily  they had  saved  enough of  their  stores  to  last  them  still <
line 5247=>for some time. <
line 5248=>@g on what was  to be done, but  they could  think of no way of <
line 5249=>getting  rid  of  Smaug  â€“  which  had  always  been  a  weak  point  in  their  plans,  as <
line 5250=>0ilbo  felt  inclined  to  point  out.  Then  as  is  the  nature  of  folk  that  are  thoroughly <
line 5251=>umble at  the hobbit, blaming him  for what had at  first <
line 5252=>eased them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug's wrath so soon. <
line 5253=>ppose a burglar is to do?" asked Bilbo angrily. "I was not <
line 5254=>engaged  to  kill  dragons,  that  is  warrior's  work,  but  to  steal  treasure.  I  made  the <
line 5255=>best  beginning  I  could.  Did  you  expect  me  to  trot  back  with  the  whole  hoard  of <
line 5256=>Thror  on  my  back?  If  there  is  any  grumbling  to  be  done,  I  think  I  might  have  a <
line 5257=>say. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not one. I am sure it reflects <
line 5258=>great  credit  on  your  grandfather,  but  you  cannot  pretend  that  you  ever  made  the <
line 5259=><
line 5260=>####-vast  extent  of  his  wealth  clear  to me.  I  should want  hundreds  of  years  to  bring  it <
line 5261=>all up, if I was fifty times as big, and Smaug as tame as a rabbit." <
line 5262=>After that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. <
line 5263=>"What  then  do  you  propose  we  should  do,  Mr.  Baggins?"  asked  Thorin <
line 5264=>a  at  the  moment  â€“  if  you  mean  about  removing  the  treasure. <
line 5265=>s  entirely  on  some  new  turn  of  luck  and  the  getting  rid  of <
line 5266=>  dragons  is  not  at  all  in  my  line,  but  I  will  do  my  best  to  think <
line 5267=>about it. Personally I have no hopes at all, and wish I was safe back at home." <
line 5268=>ent! What are we to do now,  to-day?" <
line 5269=>at are we to do now,  to-day?" ant my  advice,  I  should  say we  can  do  nothing  but  stay <
line 5270=>an  no  doubt  creep  out  safely  enough  to  take  the  air. <
line 5271=>Perhaps before long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the river <
line 5272=>and replenish our supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside <
line 5273=>the tunnel by night. <
line 5274=>"Now  I  will  make  you  an  offer.  I  have  got my  ring  and will  creep  down  this <
line 5275=>very  noon-then  if  ever  Smaug  ought  to  be  napping-and  see  what  he  is  up  to. <
line 5276=>Perhaps something will turn up. 'Every worm has his weak spot,' as my father used <
line 5277=> was not from personal experience." <
line 5278=>not from personal experience." cepted  the  offer  eagerly.  Already  they  had  come  to <
line 5279=>respect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in their adventure. He had <
line 5280=>begun  to  have  ideas  and  plans  of  his  own. When  midday  came  he  got  ready  for <
line 5281=>another  journey  down  into  the Mountain. He  did  not  like  it  of  course,  but  it was <
line 5282=>knew, more  or  less, what was  in  front  of  him. Had  he  known <
line 5283=>more about dragons and  their wily ways, he might have  teen more  frightened and <

line 5285=>l of catching this one napping. tarted, but it was as dark as night in the tunnel. <
line 5286=>The light from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down. So silent was <
line 5287=>his going  that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpasses  it, and he was <
line 5288=>inclined  to  feel  a  bit  proud  of  himself  as  he  drew  near  the  lower  door. There was <
line 5289=>only the very fainter glow to be seen. <
line 5290=> the very fainter glow to be seen. eep," he  thought.  "He can't,  see me and he won't <
line 5291=>Cheer  up  Bilbo!"  He  had  forgotten  or  had  never  heard  about  dragons' <
line 5292=><
line 5293=> they keep half an eye open watching while they <
line 5294=>y are  suspicious. Smaug certainly  looked  fast asleep, almost dead and <
line 5295=>ely a snore more than a whiff of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped <
line 5296=>once more frome was just about to step out on to the floor when he <
line 5297=>caught  a  sudden  thin  and  piercing  ray  of  red  from  under  the  drooping  lid.  of <
line 5298=>Smaug's  left  eye.  He  was  only  pretending  to  sleep!  He  was  watching  the  tunnel <
line 5299=>entrance!  Hurriedly  Bilbo  stepped  back  and  blessed  the  luck  of  his  ring.  Then <
line 5300=>Smaug s thief!  I  smell  you  and  I  feel  your  air.  I  hear  your  breath. Come  along! <
line 5301=>Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!" <
line 5302=>quite  so  unlearned  in  dragon-lore as all  that, and  if Smaug <
line 5303=>er so easily he was disappointed. <
line 5304=>so easily he was disappointed. he.  Tremendous!"  he  replied.  "I  did  not  come  for <
line 5305=>ts. I only wished  to have a  look at you and see  if you were  truly as great as <
line 5306=>tales say. I did not believe them." <
line 5307=>ieve them."   now?"  said  the  dragon  somewhat  flattered,  even  though  he  did  not <
line 5308=>believe a word of it.                   j <
line 5309=>               j  songs  and  tales  fall  utterly  short  of  the  reality,  O  Smaug  the  Chiefest <
line 5310=>and Greatest of Calamities," replied Bilbo.                                               I <
line 5311=>You  have  nice  manners  for  a  thief  and  a  liar,"  said  the  dragon.  "You  seem <
line 5312=>me,  but  I  don't  seem  to  remember  smelling  you  before. Who <
line 5313=>are you and e from, may I ask?" <
line 5314=>ay I ask?" indeed!  I  come  from  under  the  hill,  and  under  hills  and  over  the <
line 5315=>. And through the air, I am he that walks unseen." <
line 5316=>"So I can well believe," said Smaug, "but that is hardly our usual name." <
line 5317=>"I am  the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I as chosen for the lucky <
line 5318=>number." <
line 5319=>"Lovely  titles!"  sneered  the  dragon.  "But  lucky  numbers  don't  always  come <
line 5320=>off." <
line 5321=>"I  am  he  that  buries  his  friends  alive  and  drowns  them  and  draws  them  alive <
line 5322=>again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me." <
line 5323=>"These don't sound so creditable," scoffed Smaug. <
line 5324=>"I  am  the  friend  of  bears  and  the  guest  of  eagles.  I  am  Ringwinner  and <
line 5325=>Luckwearer;  and  I  am  Barrel-rider," went  on Bilbo  beginning  to  be  pleased with <
line 5326=>his riddling. <
line 5327=>"That's  better!"  said  Smaug.  "But  don't  let  your  imagination  run  away  with <

line 5329=>proper  name  (which  is  wise),  and  don't  want  to  infuriate  them  by  a  flat  refusal <
line 5330=>(which is also very wise). No dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk and <
line 5331=>ying to understand it. There was a lot here which Smaug did not <
line 5332=>  expect  you  do,  since  you  know  all  about  Bilbo's <
line 5333=>adventures  to which  he was  referring), but he  thought he understood enough, and <
line 5334=>is wicked inside. <
line 5335=>"I  thought so  last night," he smiled  to himself. "Lake-men, some nasty scheme <
line 5336=>of those miing Lake-men, or I'm a lizard. I haven't been down that <
line 5337=>way for an age and an age; but I will soon alter that!" <
line 5338=>"Very  well,  O  Barrel-rider!"  he  said  aloud.  "Maybe  Barrel  was  your  pony's <
line 5339=>name;  athough  it was  fat  enough. You may walk  unseen,  but  you <
line 5340=>d  not  walk  all  the  way.  Let  me  tell  you  I  ate  six  ponies  last  night  and  I  shall <
line 5341=>before long. In return for the excellent meal I will give <
line 5342=>one  piece  of  advice  for  your  good:  don't  have more  to  do with  dwarves  than <
line 5343=>you can help!" <
line 5344=> pretended surprise. <
line 5345=>"Don't talk to me!" said Smaug. "I know the smell (and taste) of dwarf-no one <
line 5346=>hat  I  can  eat  a  dwarf-ridden  pony  and  not  know  it!  You'll <
line 5347=>  you  go with  such  friends. Thief Barrel-rider. I don't mind if <
line 5348=>you go back and tell them so from me." <
line 5349=>and tell them so from me." Bilbo that there was one smell he could not make out at all, <
line 5350=>hobbit-smell; it was quite outside his experience and puzzled him mightily.  <
line 5351=>"I  suppose  you  got  a  fair  price  for  that  cup  last  night?"  he  went  on.  "Come <
line 5352=> at  all! Well,  that's  just  like  them. And  I  suppose  they  are <
line 5353=>0your  job  is  to  do  all  the  dangerous work  and  get what  you <
line 5354=>can  when  g-for  them?  And  you  will  get  a  fair  share?  Don't  you <
line 5355=>believe it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky." <
line 5356=> <
line 5357=>Bilbo  was  now  beginning  to  feel  really  uncomfortable.  Whenever  Smaug's <
line 5358=> for  him  in  the  shadows,  flashed  across  him,  he  trembled,  and <
line 5359=> seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and tell <
line 5360=>all  the  truth  to  Smaug.  In  fact  he  was  in  grievous  danger  of  coming  under  the <
line 5361=>dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke again. <
line 5362=>"You  don't  know  everything, O  Smaug  the Mighty,"  said  he.  "Not  gold  alone <
line 5363=>0#-"Ha! Ha! You  admit  the  'us',"  laughed Smaug. "Why not say  'us fourteen' and <
line 5364=>th  it.  Mr.  Lucky  Number?  I  am  pleased  to  hear  that  you  had  other <
line 5365=>0se  parts  besides  my  gold.  In  that  case  you  may,  perhaps,  not <
line 5366=>ime. <
line 5367=>curred to you that, even if you could steal the gold bit <
line 5368=>by bit-a matter of a hundred years or so â€“ you could not get it very far? Not much <
line 5369=>use  on  the  mountain-side? Not much use  in  the  forest? Bless me! Had you never <
line 5370=>thought  of  the  catch?  A  fourteenth  share,  I  suppose,  Or  something  like  it,  those <
line 5371=> what  about  delivery? What  about  cartage? What  about <
line 5372=>armed guards and tolls?" And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily <
line 5373=>his  guesses  were  not  far  out,  though  he  suspected  that  the <
line 5374=>Lake-men wof the plans, and that most of the plunder was meant to <
line 5375=>stop  there  in  the  town  by  the  shore  that  in  his  young  days  had  been  called <
line 5376=>Esgaroth. <
line 5377=>You will hardly believe  it, but poor Bilbo was  really very  taken aback. So far <
line 5378=>all  his.  thoughts  and  energies  had  been  concentrated  on  getting  to  the  Mountain <
line 5379=>0  entrance. He  had  never  bothered  to wonder  how  the  treasure was <
line 5380=>y never how any part of it that might fall to his share was to <
line 5381=>be brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill. <
line 5382=>Now  a  nasty  suspicion  began  to  grow  in  his  mind-had  the  dwarves  forgotten <
line 5383=>too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the time? <
line 5384=>That  is  the gon-talk has on the inexperienced. Bilbo of course ought <
line 5385=>to have been on his guard; but Smaug had rather an overwhelming personality.  <
line 5386=>,  in  an  effort  to  remain  loyal  to his  friends  and  to keep his <
line 5387=>end up,only an afterthought with  us. We came over hill and under <
line 5388=>hill,  by  wave  and  win,  for  Revenge.  Surely, O  Smaug  the  unassessably wealthy, <
line 5389=>you must realize that your success has made you some bitter enemies?" <
line 5390=>Then  Smaug  really  did  laugh-a  devastating  sound  which  shook  Bilbo  to  the <
line 5391=>floor, while  far  up  in  the  tunnel  the  dwarves  huddled  together  and  imagined  that <
line 5392=>the hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end. <
line 5393=>the  light  of  his  eyes  lit  the  the  hall  from  floor  to <
line 5394=> "Revenge! The King under the Mountain is dead and <
line 5395=>where are hi kin  that dare  seek  revenge? Girion Lord of Dale  is dead, and  I have <
line 5396=>ike  a wolf  among  sheep,  and where  are  his  sons'  sons  that  dare <
line 5397=>approawhere  I wish  and  none  dare  resist.  I  laid  low  the warriors of <
line 5398=>t in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now <
line 5399=>I  am  old  and  strong,  strong  strong.  Thief  in  the  Shadows!"  he  gloated.  "My <
line 5400=><
line 5401=>####-armour  is  like  tenfold shields, my  teeth are swords, my claws spears,  the shock of <
line 5402=>my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death!" <
line 5403=>"I  have  always  understood,"  said  Bilbo  in  a  frightened  squeak,  "that  dragons <
line 5404=>erneath, especially in the region of theâ€“erâ€“chest; but doubtless one <
line 5405=>ht of that." <
line 5406=> short in his boasting. "Your information is antiquated," he <
line 5407=>snapped.  "I  am  armoured  above  and  below  with  iron  scales  and  hard  gems.  No <
line 5408=>blade can pierce me." <
line 5409=>"I might  have  guessed  it,"  said Bilbo.  "Truly  there  can;  nowhere  be found the <
line 5410=>equal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat <
line 5411=>amonds!" <
line 5412=>nd wonderful,  indeed,"  said  Smaug  absurdly  pleased. He  did <
line 5413=>had  already  caught  a  glimpse  of  his  peculiar  under-<
line 5414=>covering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for reasons of his <
line 5415=>own. The dragon rolled over. "Look!" he said. "What do you say to that?" <
line 5416=>"Dazzlingly  marvellous!  Perfect!  Flawless!  Staggering!"  exclaimed  Bilbo <
line 5417=>aloud, but what he thought inside was: "Old fool! Why there is a large patch in the <
line 5418=>hollow of his left breast as bare as a snail out of its shell!" <
line 5419=>Baggins'  one  idea was  to  get  away.  "Well,  I  really <

line 5423=>It was an unfortunate remark, for  the dragon spouted  terrific flames after him, <
line 5424=>and  fast  though  he  sped  up  the  slope,  he  had  not  gone  nearly  far  enough  to  be <
line 5425=>comfortable  before  the  ghastly  head  of  Smaug  was  thrust  against  the  opening <
line 5426=>whole  head  and  jaws  could  not  squeeze  in,  but  the  nostrils <
line 5427=>sent  forth  fire  and  vapour  to  pursue  him,  and  he  was  nearly  overcome,  and <
line 5428=>stumbled blindly on in great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather pleased with <
line 5429=>the  cleverness  of  his  conversation  with  Smaug,  but  his  mistake  at  the  end  shook <

line 5434=>0as turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled <
line 5435=>and  fell  in  a  faint  on  the  'door-step.'  The  dwarves  revived  him,  and  doctored  his <
line 5436=>orches  as well  as  they  could; but  it was  a  long  time before  the hair on  the back <
line 5437=><
line 5438=>####-of  his  head  and  his  heels  grew  properly  again:  it had  all been  singed  and  frizzled <
line 5439=>right down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him up; <
line 5440=>y were eager for his story, especially wanting to know why the dragon had <
line 5441=>ise, and how Bilbo had escaped. <
line 5442=>se, and how Bilbo had escaped.  and  uncomfortable,  and  they  had  difficulty  in <
line 5443=>getting anything out of him. On  thinking  things over he was now  regretting  some <
line 5444=>said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat them. The old <
line 5445=>thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one side, listening to <
line 5446=>all  that was  said.  It  shows what  an  ill  temper Bilbo was  in:  he  picked  up  a  stone <
line 5447=>and threw it at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and came back. <
line 5448=>"Drat  the  bird!"  said  Bilbo  crossly.  "I  believe  he  is  listening,  and  I  don't  like <
line 5449=>the look of him." <
line 5450=>one!"  said Thorin.  "The  thrushes  are  good  and  friendly-this is a <
line 5451=>very  old  bird  indeed,  and  is  maybe  the  last  left  of  the  ancient  breed  that  used  to <
line 5452=>live about here, tame to the hands of my father and grandfather. They were a long-<
line 5453=>lived and magical race, and this might even be one of those that were alive then, a <
line 5454=>undreds years or more ago. The Men of Dale used  to have  the  trick of <
line 5455=>anguage,  and  used  them  for messengers  to  fly  to  the Men of <
line 5456=>the Lake andell, he'll have news to take to Lake-town all right, if that is what he is after," <
line 5457=>said Bilbo; "though I don't suppose there are any people left there that trouble with <
line 5458=>hy what has happened?" cried the dwarves. "Do get on with your tale!" <
line 5459=>0l  he  could  remember,  and  he  confessed  that  he  had  a <
line 5460=>nasty  feeling  that  the  dragon  guessed  too  much  from  his  riddles  added  to  the <
line 5461=>camps  and  the  ponies.  "I  am  sure  he  knows  we  came  from  Lake-town  and  had <
line 5462=>help  from  there;  and  I  have  a  horrible  feeling  that  his  next  move  may  be  in  that <
line 5463=>direction.  I  wish  to  goodness  I  had  never  said  that  about  Barrel-rider;  it  would <
line 5464=>make even a blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake-men." <
line 5465=>"Well,  well!  It  cannot  be  helped,  and  it  is  difficult  not  to  slip  in  talking  to  a <
line 5466=>0or  so  I  have  always  heard,"  said  Balin  anxious  to  comfort  him.  "I  think <
line 5467=>very well,  if  you  ask me-you found out one very useful thing at any rate, <
line 5468=>and got home alive, and  that  is more  than most can say who have had words with <
line 5469=> mercy and a blessing yet to know of the bare patch <
line 5470=>in the old Worm's diamond waistcoat." <
line 5471=>istcoat."   turned  the  conversation,  and  they  all  began  discussing  dragon-slayings <
line 5472=>historical,  dubious,  and  mythical,  and  the  various  sorts  of  stabs  and  jabs  and <
line 5473=><
line 5474=>####-undercuts,  and  the  different  arts,  devices  and  stratagems  by which  they  had  been <
line 5475=>accomplished. The general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not as <
line 5476=>easy as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more likely <
line 5477=>to  end  in  disaster  than  a  bold  frontal  attack.  All  the  while  they  talked  the  thrush <
line 5478=>ned,  till  at  last when  the  stars  began  to  peep  forth,  it  silently  spread  its wings <
line 5479=>  while  they  talked  and  the  shadows  lengthened  Bilbo <
line 5480=>ame more and more unhappy and his foreboding <
line 5481=>ore unhappy and his foreboding pted them. "I am sure we are very unsafe here," he said, "and <
line 5482=>I don't see the point of sitting here. The dragon has withered all the pleasant green, <
line 5483=>and  anyway  the  night  has  come  and  it  is  cold.  But  I  feel  it  in my  bones  that  this <
line 5484=>place will be attacked again. Smaug knows now how I came down to his hall, and <
line 5485=>you  can  trust  him  to  guess where  the  other  end  of  the  tunnel  is. He will break all <
line 5486=>this  side  of  the Mountain  to  bits,  if  necessary,  to  stop  up  our  entrance,  and  if  we <
line 5487=>are smashed with it the better he will like it." <
line 5488=>Baggins!"  said  Thorin.  "Why  has  not  Smaug <
line 5489=>ower  end,  then,  if  he  is  so  eager  to  keep  us  out?  He  has  not,  or  we <
line 5490=>should have heard him." <
line 5491=>"I  don't  know,  I  don't  know-because  at  first  he  wanted  to  try  and  lure  me  in <
line 5492=>again, I suppose, and now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight's hunt, or <
line 5493=>because he doemage his bedroom if he can help it â€“ but I wish you <
line 5494=>would not argue. Smaug will be coming out at any minute now, and our only hope <
line 5495=>0nel and shut the door." <
line 5496=>He  seemed  so much  in  earnest  that  the  dwarves  at  last  did  as  he said,  though <
line 5497=>they  delayed  shutting  the  door-it  seemed  a  desperate  plan,  for  no  one  knew <
line 5498=>ey  could  get  it  open  again  from  the  inside,  and  the  thought  of <
line 5499=>place  from  which  the  only  way  out  led  through  the  dragon's  lair <
line 5500=>was  liked.  Also  everything  seemed  quite  quiet,  both  outside  and <
line 5501=>longish while they sat inside not far down from the half-<
line 5502=>open  door  and  went  on  talking.  The  talk  turned  to  the  dragon's  wicked  words <
line 5503=>about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had never heard them, or at least that he could <
line 5504=>feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest when they declared <
line 5505=>they had never thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had <
line 5506=>been won.  <
line 5507=>"We  knew  it  would  be  a  desperate  venture,"  said  Thorin,  "and we  know  that <
line 5508=>ill  think  that when we have won  it will be  time enough  to  think what <
line 5509=>As  for  your  share,  Mr.  Baggins,  I  assure  you  we  are  more  than <

line 5511=><
line 5512=>####-divide, am sorry if you are worried about transport, and I admit the difficulties are <
line 5513=>great-the  lands  have  not  become  less  wild  with  the  passing  of  time,  rather  the <
line 5514=>reverse-but  we  will  do  whatever  we  can  for  you,  and  take  our  share  of  the  cost <
line 5515=>when the time comes. Believe me or not as you like!" <
line 5516=>urned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin <
line 5517=>and Balin remembered. They wondered if they were still lying there .unharmed in <
line 5518=>:  the  spears  that  were  made  for  the  armies  of  the  great  King <
line 5519=>Bladorce  dead),  each  had  a  thrice-forged head and  their  shafts were <
line 5520=> but  they were never delivered or paid  for;  shields made <
line 5521=>for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two-handed, hammered and <
line 5522=>and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; coats of mail <
line 5523=>trable;  the necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale, made <
line 5524=>of five hundred emeralds green as grass, which he gave for the arming of his eldest <
line 5525=>dwarf-linked rings the like of which had never been made before, <
line 5526=>for  it  was  e  silver  to  the  power  and  strength  of  triple  steel.  But <
line 5527=>reat  white  gem,  which  the  dwarves  had  found  beneath  the <
line 5528=>rt of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain. <
line 5529=>ain, the Arkenstone of Thrain.   The  Arkenstone!"  murmured  Thorin  in  the  dark,  half <
line 5530=>dreaming with his chin upon his knees. "It was like a globe with a thousand facets; <
line 5531=>it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under the stars, <
line 5532=>like rain upon the Moon!" <
line 5533=>0 of  the hoard had  fallen  from Bilbo. All  through  their <
line 5534=>k  he  was  only  half  listening  to  them.  He  sat  nearest  to  the  door with  one  ear <
line 5535=>cocked  for  any  beginnings  of  a  sound  without,  his  other  was  alert  or  echoes <
line 5536=>beyond  the  murmurs  of  the  dwarves,  for  any  whisper  of  a  movement  from  far <
line 5537=>s  grew  deeper  and  he  grew  ever  more  uneasy.  "Shut  the  door!"  he <
line 5538=>r that dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less than the <
line 5539=>e door before it is too late!" <
line 5540=>Something  in  his  voice  gave  the  dwarves  an  uncomfortable  feeling.  Slowly <
line 5541=>Thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged <
line 5542=>the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. No trace <
line 5543=>eyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in the Mountain! <
line 5544=>And  not  a  moment  too  soon.  They  had  hardly  gone  any  distance  down  the <
line 5545=>tunnel  when  a  blow  smote  the  side  of  the  Mountain  like  the  crash  of  battering-<
line 5546=>0e  of  forest  oaks  and  swung  by  giants.  The  rock  boomed,  the  walls <
line 5547=> fell from the roof on their heads. What would have happened if <
line 5548=>pen I don't like to think. They fled further down the tunnel <
line 5549=>glad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and rumble of <
line 5550=>Smaug's  fury.  He  was  breaking  rocks  to  pieces,  smashing  wall  and  cliff  with  the <
line 5551=>lashings  of  his  huge  tail,  till  their  little  lofty  camping ground,  the  scorched grass, <
line 5552=>the thrush's stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow ledge, and all disappeared in <
line 5553=>a  jumble  of  smithereens,  and  an  avalanche  of  splintered  stones  fell  over  the  cliff <
line 5554=>into the valley below.  <
line 5555=>  in  silent  stealth,  quietly  soared  into  the  air,  and  then <
line 5556=>he dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind towards <
line 5557=>the  west  of  the  Mountain,  in  the  hopes  of  catching  unawares  something  or <
line 5558=>d  of  spying  the outlet  to  the passage which  the  thief had used. <
line 5559=>  of  his  wrath  when  he  could  find  nobody  and  see  nothing, <
line 5560=>even where utlet must actually be. <
line 5561=>ually be. he  had  let  off  his  rage  in  this  way  he  felt  better  and  he  thought  in  his <
line 5562=>heart that he would not be troubled again from that direction. In-the meanwhile he <
line 5563=>nce to take. "Barrel-rider!" he snorted. "Your fee came from the <
line 5564=> you  came with  out  a  doubt.  I  don't  know  your  smell, <
line 5565=>but if you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had their help. They shall see <
line 5566=>me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!" <
line 5567=>He rose in fire and went away south towards the Running River.  <
line 5568=>ter 13</h4> <br> <
line 5569=><
line 5570=>Not at Home <
line 5571=><
line 5572=>rves  sat  in  darkness,  and  utter  silence  fell  about <
line 5573=>them.  Little  they  ate  and  little  they  spoke.  They  could  not  count  the  passing  of <
line 5574=>time; and  they  scarcely dared  to move,  for  the whisper of  their voices echoed and <
line 5575=>rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to silence going <
line 5576=>t after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were <
line 5577=>becoming  choked  and  dazed  for  want  of  air,  they  could  bear  it  no  longer.  They <
line 5578=>would  almost  have  welcomed  sounds  from  below  of  the  dragon's  return.  In  the <
line 5579=>silence  they  feared  some  cunning  devilry  of  his,  but  they  could  not  sit  there  for <
line 5580=>ever. <
line 5581=>Thorin spoke: "Let us  try  the door!" he said. "I must feel  the wind on my face <
line 5582=> I  think  I  would  rather  be  smashed  by  Smaug  in  the  open  than <
line 5583=>o several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been. <
line 5584=>hat  the  upper  end  of  the  tunnel  had  been  shattered  and  blocked <
line 5585=>ither key nor  the magic  it had once obeyed would ever  open <
line 5586=>that door again. <
line 5587=>!" they groaned. "This is the end. We shall die here." <
line 5588=>But  somehow,  just  when  the  dwarves  were  most  despairing,  Bilbo  felt  a <
line 5589=>strange  lightening  of  the  heart,  as  if  a  heavy  weight  had  gone  from  under  his <
line 5590=>waistcoat. <
line 5591=>"Come, come!" he  said.  "While  there's  life  there's hope!" as my  father used  to <
line 5592=>e  pays  for  all.'  I  am  going  down  the  tunnel  once  again.  I  have <
line 5593=>ice,  when  I  knew  there  was  a  dragon  at  the  other  end,  so  I  will <
line 5594=>risit  when  I  am  no  longer  sure.  Anyway  the  only  way  out  is  down. <
line 5595=>ou had better all come with me." <
line 5596=> had better all come with me." d Thorin was the first go forward by Bilbo's side. <
line 5597=>"Now  do  be  careful!"  whispered  the  hobbit,  "and  quiet  as  you  can  be! There <
line 5598=>he bottom but then again there may be. Don't let us take any <
line 5599=>unnecessary risks!" <
line 5600=>Down,  down  they  went.  The  dwarves  could  not,  course,  compare  with  the <
line 5601=> and  the made  a  deal  of  puffing  and  shuffling which  echoes <
line 5602=>hough every now and again Bilbo  in  fear  stopped and <
line 5603=>listened,  not  a  sound  stirred  below  Near  the  bottom,  as  well  as  he  could  judge, <
line 5604=><
line 5605=>####-Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was <
line 5606=>complete,  and  they were  all  invisible,  ring  or  no  ring.  In  fact  so  black was  it  that <
line 5607=>  came  to  the  opening  unexpectedly,  put  his  hand  on  air,  stumbled  for <
line 5608=>ward, and rolled headlong into the hall! <
line 5609=>to the hall! e he  lay face downwards on  the floor and did no dare  to get up, or hardly <
line 5610=>even  to  breathe.  But  nothing  moved.  There  was  not  a  gleam  of  light-unless,  as <
line 5611=>seemed last he slowly raised his head, there was a pale white glint, <
line 5612=>above him and far off in the gloom. But certainly it was not a spark of dragon-fire, <
line 5613=> wormstench was heavy in the place, and the taste of vapour was on his <
line 5614=>tongue. <
line 5615=>At length Mr. Baggins could bear it no longer. "Come found you, Smaug, you <
line 5616=>worm!"  he  squeaked  aloud.  "Stop  playing  hide-and-seek!  Give  me  a  light,  and <
line 5617=>then eat me if you can catch me!" <
line 5618=>atch me!" hoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. Bilbo got up, <
line 5619=>t know in what direction to turn. <
line 5620=>now in what direction to turn. rth  Smaug  is  playing  at,"  he  said.  "He  is  not  at <
line 5621=>home  today  (or  tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and Gloin have not <
line 5622=>lost  their  time  tinder-boxes,  perhaps  we  can  make  a  little  light,  and  have  a  look <
line 5623=>round before the luck turns." <
line 5624=>"Light!" he cried. "Can anybody make a light?" <
line 5625=>ht!" he cried. "Can anybody make a light?" ere  very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the <
line 5626=>step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at <
line 5627=>the end the tunnel. <
line 5628=>"Sh!  sh!"  they  hissed,  when  they  heard  his  voice:  and  though  that  helped  the <
line 5629=>hobbit  to  find  out where  they  were, was  some  time  before  he  could  get  anything <
line 5630=>else out of  them. But  in  the end, when Bilbo actually began  to stamp  in  the  floor, <
line 5631=>ut  light!'  at  the  top  of  his  thrill  voice,  Thorin  gave  way,  and  Oin <
line 5632=>and Gloin were sent back  to  their bundles  at the top of the tunnel. After a while a <
line 5633=>twinkling  gleam  showed  them  returning,  in  with  a  small  pine-torch  alight  in  his <
line 5634=>0a  bundle  of  others  under  his  arm.  Quickly  Bilbo  trotted  to <
line 5635=> torch;  but  he  could  not  persuade  the  dwarves  to  light  the <
line 5636=> join  him  yet.  As  Thorin  carefully  explained,  Mr.  Baggins <
line 5637=>was  still  o  expert  burglar  and  investigator.  If  he  liked  to  risk  a  light, <
line 5638=>.  They would wait  in  the  tunnel  for  his  report. So  they  sat near <
line 5639=> <
line 5640=>shape  of  the  hobbit  start  across  the  floor  holding  his <
line 5641=>d again, while he was still near enough,  they caught <
line 5642=><
line 5643=>####-a  glint  and  a  tinkle  as  he  stumbled  on  some  golden  thing. The  light grew  smaller <
line 5644=>he wandered  away  into  the  vast  hall;  then  it  began  to  rise  dancing  into  the  air. <
line 5645=>Bilbo was climbing  the great mound of  treasure. Soon he stood upon  the  top, and <
line 5646=>still  went  on.  Then  they  saw  him  halt  and  stoop  for  a  moment;  but  they  did  not <
line 5647=>know  the  reason.  It  was  the  Arkenstone,  the  Heart  of  the  Mountain.  So  Bilbo <
line 5648=>0orin's  description;  but  indeed  there  could  not  be  two  such  gems, <
line 5649=>s a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as he climbed, the same <
line 5650=>white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards Slowly it grew to a <
line 5651=>of  pallid  light.  Now  as  came  near,  it  was  tinged  with  a  flickering <
line 5652=>sparkle  of man  colours  at  the  surface,  reflected  and  splintered  from  the wavering <
line 5653=>ch.  At  last  he  looked  down  upon  it  and  he  caught  his  breath.  The <
line 5654=>0ne before he  feet of  its own  inner  light,  and yet,  cut  and  fashioned <
line 5655=>by  the  dwarves, who  had  dug  it  from  the  heart  of  the mountain  long  ago,  it  took <
line 5656=>all light that fell upon it and-changes it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance <
line 5657=>bow.  <
line 5658=>Suddenly  Bilbo's  arm  went  towards  it  drawn  by  it  enchantment.  His  small <
line 5659=> would  not  close  about  it  for  it  was  a  large  and  heavy  gem;  but  he  lifted  it, <
line 5660=>0hut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket. <
line 5661=> burglar  indeed!"  thought  he.  "But  I  suppose  I  must  tell  the <
line 5662=> time. The  did  say  I  could  pick  and  choose my  own  share; <
line 5663=>and  I  thinke  this,  if  they  took  all  the  rest!" All  the same he had an <
line 5664=>  the picking and choosing had not  really been meant  to <
line 5665=>include  this marvellous gem, and  that  trouble would yet come of  it. Now he went <
line 5666=>he other side of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of his <
line 5667=>torch  vanishight  of  the  watching  dwarves.  But  soon  they  saw  it  far <
line 5668=>lbo was crossing the floor of the hall. <
line 5669=>rossing the floor of the hall. e  came  to  the  great  doors  at  the  further  side,  and  there  a <
line 5670=>hed him, but  it almost puffed out his  light. He peeped  timidly <
line 5671=>through and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of wide <
line 5672=>stairs  going  up  into  the  gloom. And  still  there was  no  sight  nor  sound  of  Smaug. <
line 5673=>He was  just  going  to  turn  and  go back, when  a black  shape  swooped  at him  and <
line 5674=>brushed his face. He squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. His torch <
line 5675=>dropped head downwards and went out! <
line 5676=>ed head downwards and went out!   and  hope!"  he  said  miserably.  But  now  what  am  I  to <
line 5677=>do? Which is East, South, North West?" <
line 5678=>h is East, South, North West?" n! Gloin! Fill! Kili!"  he  cried  as  loud  he  could-it seemed a <
line 5679=> wide  blackness.  "The  light's  gone  out!  Someone  come  and <
line 5680=>find and help me!" For the moment his courage had failed together.  <

line 5684=>queaking." <
line 5685=> or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no sound <
line 5686=>at  all  in  fact  but  Bilbo's  distant  voice.  "Come,  one  of  you,  get  another  light  or <
line 5687=>two!" Thorin ordered. "It seems we have got to go and help our burglar." <
line 5688=>"It  is  about  our  turn  to  help,"  said  Balin,  "and  I  am  quite  willing  to  go. <

line 5691=>went    as  hurriedly  as  they  could.  It  was  not  long  before  they  met <
line 5692=>Bilbo  himself  coming  back  towards  them.  His  wits  had  quickly returned soon as <
line 5693=>he saw the twights. <
line 5694=>"Only  a  bat  and  a  dropped  torch,  nothing  worse!"  he  said  in  answer  to  their <
line 5695=>questions.  Though  they  were  much  relieved,  they  were  inclined  to  be  grumpy  at <
line 5696=>being frightened for nothing; but what they would have said, if he had told them at <
line 5697=>about  the  Arkenstone,  I  don't  know.  The  mere  fleeting  glimpses  of <
line 5698=>ey  had  caught  as  they  went  along  had  rekindled  all  the  fire  of <
line 5699=>their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is <

line 5703=>explore  the  hall  while  they  had  the  chance,  and  willing  to  believe  that,  for  the <
line 5704=>present,  Smaug  was  away  from  home.  Each  now  gripped  a  lighted  torch;  and  as <
line 5705=>they  gazed,  first  on  one  side  and  then  on  another,  they  forgot  fear  and  even <
line 5706=>cautio aloud,  and  cried  out  to  one  another,  as  they  lifted  old <
line 5707=>from the wall and held them in the light caressing and <
line 5708=>fingering them. Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging <
line 5709=>therharps  strung with  silver  they  took  them  and  struck  them;  and <
line 5710=>0o  untouched  by  the  dragon,  who  had  small  interests  in <
line 5711=>music)  they  were  still  in  tune.  The  dark  hall  was  filled  with  a  melody  that  had <
line 5712=>long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical; they gathered gems <
line 5713=>and stuffed  their pockets, and  let what  they could  not carry far back through their <
line 5714=>gh.  Thorin  was  not  least  among  these;  but  always  he  searched <
line 5715=><
line 5716=>####-from side to side for something which he could not find. It was the Arkenstone but <
line 5717=>he spoke of it yet to no one. <
line 5718=>mail  and  weapons  from  the  walls,  and  armed <
line 5719=>themselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings, with <

line 5721=>t crusted with scarlet stones.  "Here  is  the  first  payment  of  your  reward!  Cast  off <

line 5723=>With  that  he  put  on  Bilbo  a  small  coat  of mail,  wrought  for  some  young  elf-<
line 5724=>prince long ago. It was of silver-steel which the elves call mithril, and with it went <
line 5725=>a belt of pearls and crystals. A  light helm of  figured  leather, strengthened beneath <
line 5726=>with hoops of steel, and studded about the bring with white gems, was set upon the <
line 5727=>hobbit's head. <

line 5740=> answered Thorin, recovering his wits. "Let us go! I will <
line 5741=>guide you. Not  in a  thousand years should  I  forget  the ways of  this palace." Then <
line 5742=>he  hailed  the  others,  and  they  gathered  together,  and  holding  their  torches  above <

line 5748=>for any  rumour of  the dragon's coming. Though all  the old adornments were  long <
line 5749=>,  and  though  all  was  befouled  and  blasted  with  the <
line 5750=>comings  and  goings  of  the  monster,  Thorin  knew  every  passage  and  every  turn. <
line 5751=>They  climbed  long  stairs,  and  turned  and  went  down  wide  echoing  ways,  and <

line 5755=>dwarves went, and  they met no sign of any  living  thing, only furtive shadows that <
line 5756=>fled  from  the  approach  of  their  torches  fluttering  in  the  draughts.  The  steps were <
line 5757=>same, for hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just feeling that he could go <

line 5776=>still  showing  the  fragments  of  old  carven  work  within,  worn  and  splintered  and <
line 5777=>blackened  though  it was. A misty  sun  sent  its  pale  light  between  the  arms  of  the <

line 5798=>"How far is that?" asked the hobbit. <

line 5862=>In  all  their  talk  they  came  perpetually  back  to  one  thing: where was  Smaug? <

line 5873=>0 in  the  sky.  From  their  town  the  Lonely  Mountain  was  mostly <

line 5878=>Suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief glow touched it and faded. <

line 5886=>oding  gloomy  things!"  said  the  others.  "Anything  from <
line 5887=>floods to poisoned fish. Think of something cheerful!" <
line 5888=>Then  suddenly  a  great  light  appeared  in  the  low  place  in  the  hills  and  the <
line 5889=>the lake turned golden. <
line 5890=>"The King  beneath  the Mountain!"  they  shouted.  "His wealth  is  like  the  Sun, <
line 5891=>h fountain, his rivers golden run! The  river is running gold from the <
line 5892=>Mountain!"  they  cried,  and  everywhere  windows  were  opening  and  feet  were <

line 5894=>mendous excitement and enthusiasm. But  the grim-<
line 5895=>voiced fellow ran hotfoot to the Master. "The dragon is coming or I am a fool!" he <
line 5896=>o arms! To arms!" <
line 5897=>Then  warning  trumpets  were  suddenly  sounded,  and  echoed  along  the  rocky <
line 5898=>shores.  Topped  and  the  joy was  turned  to  dread.  So  it was  that  the <
line 5899=>dragon  did  not  find  them  quite  unprepared.  Before  long,  so  great was  his  speed, <
line 5900=>s  a  spark  of  fire  rushing  towards  them  and  growing  ever <
line 5901=>huger  and more  bright,  and  not  the most  foolish  doubted  that  the  prophecies  had <
line 5902=>0one  rather wrong. Still  they had a  little  time. Every vessel  in  the town was filled <
line 5903=>with  water,  every  warrior  was  armed,  every  arrow  and  dart  was  ready,  and  the <
line 5904=>bridge  to  the  land  was  thrown  down  and  destroyed,  before  the  roar  of  Smaug's <
line 5905=>ach  grew  loud,  and  the  lake  rippled  red  as  fire  beneath  the  awful <
line 5906=>beating of his wings. <
line 5907=>Amid  shrieks  and  wailing  and  the  shouts  of  men  he  came  over  them,  swept <
line 5908=>towards the bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone, and his enemies were on <
line 5909=>ep  water-too  deep  and  dark  and  cool  for  his  liking.  If  he  plunged <
line 5910=>0r and a steam would arise enough  to cover all  the  land with a mist <
line 5911=>for days;was mightier  than he,  it would quench him before he could <
line 5912=>pass through. <
line 5913=>back  over  the  town.  A  hail  of  dark  arrows  leaped  up  and <
line 5914=> scales and  jewels, and  their  shafts  fell back kindled by <
line 5915=>his  breath  burning  and  hissing  into  the  lake.  No  fireworks  you  ever  imagined <
line 5916=>equalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the <

line 5919=>t  been  for  the  grim-voiced man  (Bard was his name), who <
line 5920=>ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them to fight <
line 5921=>to the last arrow.  <
line 5922=>Fire leaped from the dragon's jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above <
line 5923=>ighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood <
line 5924=>with  leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight <
line 5925=>through  the eckless  in  his  rage,  taking  no  heed  to  turn  his  scaly <
line 5926=>sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze. <
line 5927=>oofs  and  wooden  beam-ends  as  he  hurtled  down <
line 5928=>and  past  and  round  again,  though  all  had  been  drenched  with  water  before  he <
line 5929=>came. Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. <
line 5930=>Back  swirled  the  dragon.  A  sweep  of  his  tail  and  the  roof  of  the  Great  House <
line 5931=>crumbled  and  smashed  down.  Flames  unquenchable  sprang  high  into  the  night. <
line 5932=>and another, and another house and  then another  sprang afire and <
line 5933=>fell;  and  still  no  arrow  hindered  Smaug  or  hurt  him  more  than  a  fly  from  the <
line 5934=>umping  into  the  water  on  every  side.  Women  and <
line 5935=>children  were  being  huddled  into  laden  boats  in  the  market-pool. Weapons were <

line 5937=>  had  been  sung  about  the  dwarves. Now men cursed  their <
line 5938=>names.  The  Master  himself  was  turning  to  his  great  gilded  boat,  hoping  to  row <
line 5939=> in  the confusion and save himself. Soon all  the  town would be deserted and <
line 5940=>burned down to the surface of the lake. That was the dragon's hope. They could all <
line 5941=>he  cared.  There  he  could  have  fine  sport  hunting  them,  or <
line 5942=>tarved. Let them try to get to land and he would be ready. <
line 5943=>  he  would  set  all  the  shoreland  woods  ablaze  and  wither  every  field  and <
line 5944=>pasture.  Just  now  he  was  enjoying  the  sport  of  town-baiting  more  than  he  had <
line 5945=>enjoyed anything for years. But there was still a company of archers that held their <
line 5946=>ground among the burning houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-<
line 5947=>faced,  whose  friends  had  accused  him  of  prophesying  floods  and  poisoned  fish, <
line 5948=>ew  his  worth  and  courage.  He  was  a  descendant  in  long  line  of <
line 5949=> whose wife and child had escaped down  the Running River <
line 5950=>from  the  ruin  long  ago. Now  he  shot with  a  great yew bow,  till all his arrows but <
line 5951=>one were spent. The flames were near him. His companions were leaving him. He <

line 5953=>shoulder.  He  started-but  it was  only  an  old  thrush. Unafraid  it perched by his ear <
line 5954=>and it brought him news. Marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for <
line 5955=>he was of the race of Dale. <
line 5956=>"Wait! Wait!"  it  said  to  him.  "The moon  is  rising.  Look  for  the  hollow  of  the <
line 5957=>left  breast  as  he  flies  and  turns  above  you!" And while Bard paused  in wonder  it <
line 5958=>n  the  Mountain  and  of  all  that  it  had  heard.  Then  Bard <
line 5959=>drew his bow-string to his ear. The dragon was circling back, flying low, and as he <
line 5960=>came the moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered his great wings. <
line 5961=>"Arrow!"  said  the  bowman.  "Black  arrow!  I  have  saved  you  to  the  last.  You <
line 5962=>have never  failed me and always  I have  recovered you.  I had you  from my  father <
line 5963=>f  old.  If  ever  you  came  from  the  forges  of  the  true  king  under  the <
line 5964=>Mountain, go now and speed well!" <
line 5965=>speed well!"   swooped  once more  lower  than  ever,  and  as  he  turned  and  dived <
line 5966=>down his belly glittered white with  sparkling  fires of gems  in  the moon-but not in <
line 5967=>one place. Thnged. The black arrow sped straight from  the string, <
line 5968=>straight  for  the  hollow  by  the  left  breast  where  the  foreleg  was  flung  wide.  In  it <
line 5969=>and vanished, barb, shaft and  feather, so  fierce was  its  flight. With a shriek <
line 5970=>that  deafened men,  felled  trees  and  split  stone,  Smaug  shot  spouting  into  the  air, <

line 5973=> leaped up, white  in  the sudden dark under  the moon. <
line 5974=><
line 5975=>####-There  was  a  hiss,  a  gushing  whirl,  and  then  silence.  And  that  was  the  end  of <
line 5976=>Smaug  and  Esgaroth,  but  not  of  Bard.  The waxing moon  rose  higher  and  higher <
line 5977=>and the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white fog into bending pillars and <
line 5978=>rove  it  off  to  the West  to  scatter  in  tattered  shreds over  the <
line 5979=>d. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the <
line 5980=>surface of  the  lake, and down  the wind came  the voices of  the people of Esgaroth <
line 5981=>  lost  town and goods and  ruined houses. But  they had  really much <

line 5984=>alive;  their  woods  and  fields  and  pastures  and  cattle  and  most  of  their  boats <
line 5985=>remained undamaged; and the dragon was dead. What that meant they had not yet <
line 5986=>realized. <
line 5987=>They  gathered  in  mournful  crowds  upon  the  western  shores,  shivering  in  the <

line 5991=>murmured, "but he  is no good when anything serious happens!" And  they praised <
line 5992=> and his last mighty shot. "If only he had not been killed," they <
line 5993=>all  said,  " him  a  king.  Bard  the  Dragon-shooter  of  the  line  of <
line 5994=>Girion! Alas that he is lost!" <
line 5995=>And  in  the very midst of  their  talk, a  tall figure stepped from  the shadows. He <
line 5996=>was drenched with water, his black hair hung wet over his face and shoulders, and <
line 5997=>a fierce light was in his eyes. <
line 5998=>light was in his eyes.  he  cried.  "He  dived  from  Esgaroth,  when  the  enemy  was <

line 6016=>songs.  ople?"-and  here  the Master  rose  to  his  feet  and  spoke  very <
line 6017=>I get all your blame? For what fault am I to be deposed? <
line 6018=>Who  aroused  the  dragon  from  his  slumber,  I might  ask? Who obtained of us rich <
line 6019=>le  help,  and  led  us  to  believe  that  old  songs  could  come  true? Who <
line 6020=>played  on  our  soft  hearts  and  our  pleasant  fancies? What  sort  of  gold  have  they <
line 6021=>iver  to  reward  us?  Dragon-fire  and  ruin!  From  whom  should we <
line 6022=>0ur damage, and aid for our widows and orphans?" <
line 6023=>the Master  had  not  got  his  position  for  nothing.  The  result  of  his <
line 6024=>0 for  the  moment  the  people  quite  forgot  their  idea  of  a  new  king, <
line 6025=>0r angry  thoughts  towards Thorin and his company. Wild and bitter <
line 6026=>words were shouted from many sides; and some of those who had before sung the <
line 6027=>old  songs  loudest,  were  now  heard  as  loudly  crying  that  the  dwarves  had  stirred <
line 6028=>the dragon up against them deliberately! <
line 6029=>deliberately! s!" said Bard. "Why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? <
line 6030=>0  first  in  fire,  before  Smaug  came  to  us."  Then  even  as  he <
line 6031=>0ght  came  into  his  heart  of  the  fabled  treasure  of  the <
line 6032=> owner, and he fell suddenly silent. He thought of <
line 6033=>the Master's  words,  and  of  Dale  rebuilt,  and  filled  with  golden  bells,  if  he  could <
line 6034=>but find the men. <
line 6035=>At  length  he  spoke  again:  "This  is  no  time  for  angry  words.  Master,  or  for <
line 6036=>considering weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you still-though <
line 6037=>while  I  may  think  again  of  your  words  and  go  North  with  any  that  will <

line 6039=>p  in  the  ordering  of  the  camps  and  in  the  care  of  the <
line 6040=>  the  Master  scowled  at  his  back  as  he  went,  and <
line 6041=>remained  sitting  on  the  ground. He  thought much  but  said  little,  unless  it was  to <
line 6042=>call  loudly  for  men  to  bring  him  fire  and  food.  Now  everywhere  Bard  went  he <
line 6043=>found  talk  running  like  fire  among  the  people  concerning  the  vast  treasure  that <
line 6044=>rded.  Men  spoke  of  the  recompense  for  all  their  harm  that  they <
line 6045=>would soon get from it, and wealth over and to spare with which to buy rich things <
line 6046=>from  the  South;  and  it  cheered  them  greatly  in  their  plight.  That was as well,  for <
line 6047=>the night was bitter and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for few (the Master <
line 6048=>e)  and  there was  little  food  (even  the Master went  short). Many  took  ill of <
line 6049=>wet  and  cold  and  sorrow  that  night,  and  afterwards  died,  who  had  escaped <
line 6050=>uninjured from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was much <
line 6051=>0ickness and great hunger.  <
line 6052=>Meanwhile  Bard  took  the  lead,  and  ordered  things  as  he  wished,  though <
line 6053=>aster's  name,  and  he  had  a  hard  task  to  govern  the  people  and <
line 6054=>direcions  for  their  protection  and  housing.  Probably  most  of  them <
line 6055=>0  the winter  that  now  hurried  after  autumn,  if  help  had  not <
line 6056=>e swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent <
line 6057=>up  the  river  to  the Forest  to ask  the aid of  the King of  the Elves of  the Wood, and <
line 6058=>these messengers had found a host already on the move, although it was then only <
line 6059=>the third day after the fall of Smaug. <
line 6060=>ter the fall of Smaug. d received news from his own messengers and from the birds <
line 6061=>that  loved  his  folk,  and  already  knew  much  of  what  had  happened.  Very  great <
line 6062=>  the commotion among all  things with wings  that dwelt on  the borders <
line 6063=> the Dragon. The  air was  filled with  circling  flocks,  and  their <
line 6064=>swift-flyflew  here  and  there  across  the  sky.  Above  the  borders  of <
line 6065=>stling,  crying  and  piping.  Far  over  Mirkwood  tidings <
line 6066=>spread: "Smaug is dead!" Leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. Even before <
line 6067=> rode  forth  the  news  had  passed west  right  to  the  pinewoods  of  the <
line 6068=>Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at <
line 6069=> will  be  the  last  we  shall  hear  of  Thorin  Oakenshield,  I  fear,"  said  the <
line 6070=>king. "He would have done better to have remained my guest. It is an ill wind, all <
line 6071=>the  same,"  he  added,  "that  blows  no  one  any  good."  For  he  too  had  not  forgotten <
line 6072=>the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it was that Bard's messengers found him now <
line 6073=>marching  with  many  spearmen  and  bowmen;  and  crows  were  gathered  thick, <
line 6074=> they  thought  that war was awakening again,  such as had not been <
line 6075=>in  those parts  for a  long age. But  the king, when he  received  the prayers of Bard, <
line 6076=>had  pity,  for  he  was  the  lord  of  a  good  and  kindly  people;  so  turning  his march, <
line 6077=>which  had  at  first  been  direct  towards  the  Mountain,  he  hastened  now  down  the <
line 6078=>r  to  the  Long  Lake.  He  had  not  boats  or  rafts  enough  for  his  host,  and  they <
line 6079=>were  forced  to  go  the  slower way  by  foot;  but  great  store  of  goods he sent ahead <
line 6080=>by water. Still elves are lightâ€“footed, and though they were not in these days much <
line 6081=>used  to  the  marches  and  the  treacherous  lands  between  the  Forest  and  the  Lake, <
line 6082=>their going was swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon <
line 6083=>the  shores and  looked on  the  ruins of  the  town. Their welcome was good, as may <
line 6084=><
line 6085=>####-be expected, and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the <
line 6086=>n for the Elvenking's aid. <
line 6087=>Their plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and the <
line 6088=>unfit,  the  Master  remained  behind;  and  with  him  were  some  men  of  crafts  and <
line 6089=>many  skilled  elves;  and  they  busied  themselves  felling  trees,  and  collecting  the <
line 6090=>Forest.  Then  they  set  about  raising  many  huts  by  the <
line 6091=>shore  against  the  oncoming  winter;  and  also  under  the  Master's  direction  they <
line 6092=>began  the planning of a new  town, designed more fair and  large even  than before, <
line 6093=>but not  in  the  same place. They  removed northward higher up  the  shore;  for  ever <
line 6094=>ad  of  the  water  where  the  dragon  lay.  He  would  never  again <
line 6095=>0 but was stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor of <
line 6096=>the  shallows.  There  for  ages  his  huge  bones  could  be  seen  in  calm weather  amid <
line 6097=>uined  piles  of  the old  town. But  few dared  to cross  the cursed spot, and none <
line 6098=>dared  to dive  into  the shivering water or recover  the precious stones  that fell from <
line 6099=>his rotting carcass. <
line 6100=>But  all  the men  of  arms  who  were  still  able,  and  the most  of  the  Elvenking's <
line 6101=>array,  got  ready  to march  north  to  the Mountain.  It  was  thus  that  in  eleven  days <
line 6102=>from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rock-gates at the end of <
line 6103=>0and came into the desolate lands. <

line 6106=>ilbo  and  the  dwarves.  All  night  one  of  them  had <
line 6107=>watched,  but when morning  came  they  had  not  heard  or  seen  any  sign  of  danger. <
line 6108=>But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from <
line 6109=>the  South;  and  the  crows  that  still  lived  about  the Mountain  were  wheeling  and <
line 6110=>crying unceasomething  strange  is  happening,"  said  Thorin.  "The  time  has  gone  for  the <
line 6111=>autumn  wanderings;  and  these  are  birds  that  dwell  always  in  the  land;  there  are <
line 6112=>starlings  and  flocks  of  finches;  and  far  off  there  are  many  carrion  birds  as  if  a <
line 6113=>battle were afoot!" <
line 6114=>Suddenly Bilbo pointed: "There  is  that old  thrush again!" he cried. "He seems <
line 6115=>ve escaped, when Smaug  smashed  the mountain-side, but I don't suppose the <
line 6116=>  enough  the  old  thrush was  there,  and  as  Bilbo  pointed,  he  flew  towards <
line 6117=>them  and  perched  on  a  stone  near  by. Then  he  fluttered  his wings  and  sang;  then <
line 6118=>is  head  on  one  side,  as  if  to  listen;  and  again  he  sang,  and  again  he <

line 6121=>the  speech  of  such  birds,  it  is  very  quick  and  difficult.  Can  you  make  it  out <
line 6122=>Baggins?" <
line 6123=>"Not very well," said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make nothing of it at <

line 6128=>nasty  suspicious-looking  creatures  at  that,  and  rude <
line 6129=>as  well.  You  must  have  heard  the  ugly  names  they were  calling  after  us. But  the <
line 6130=>ravens  are  different.  There  used  to  be  great  friendship  between  them  and  the <
line 6131=>people  of  Thror;  and  they  often  brought  us  secret  news,  and were  rewarded with <

line 6136=><
line 6137=>####-wise  and  famous  pair,  old  Care  and  his  wife,  that  lived  here  above  the  guard-<
line 6138=>chamber. But I don't suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here now." <
line 6139=>d  speaking  than  the  old  thrush  gave  a  loud  call,  and <
line 6140=>immediately flew away.  <
line 6141=>"We may not understand him, but that old bird understands us, I am sure," said <
line 6142=> and see what happens!" <
line 6143=>Before  long  there  was  a  fluttering  of  wings,  and  back  came  the  thrush;  and <
line 6144=>a most decrepit old bird. He was getting blind, he could hardly fly, <
line 6145=>and  the  top of his head was bald. He was an aged raven of great size. He alighted <
line 6146=>ly  on  the  ground  before  them,  slowly  flapped  his wings,  and  bobbed  towards <
line 6147=>Thorin. <
line 6148=>"O  Thorin  son  of  Thrain,  and  Balin  son  of  Fundin,"  he  croaked  (and  Bilbo <
line 6149=>could  understand  what  he  said,  for  he  used  ordinary  language  and  not  bird-<
line 6150=>speech).  "I  am  RÃ³ac  son  of  Carc.  Carc  is  dead,  but  he  was  well  known  to  you <

line 6160=>to caper about for joy.  <
line 6161=>"Yes,  dead,"  said RÃ³ac. "The  thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die, <

line 6163=>the third night back from now at the rising of the moon." <
line 6164=>0horin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen <
line 6165=>to  the  raven's  news. At  length when  he  had  told  all  the  tale  of  the  battle  he went <

line 6167=>"So  much  for  joy,  Thorin  Oakenshield.  You  may  go  back  to  your  halls  in <

line 6191=>"I  will  not  say  if  this  counsel  be  good  or  bad,"  croaked  RÃ³ac;  "but  I will  do <

line 6200=>will  see  that  the  dwarves  still  had  some  days  before  them.  They  explored  the <
line 6201=>caverns  once  more,  and  found,  as  they  expected,  that  only  the  Front  Gate <
line 6202=>remained  open;  all  the  other  gates  (except,  of  course,  the  small  secret  door)  had <
line 6203=>long  ago  been  broken  and  blocked  by  Smaug,  and  no  sign  of  them  remained.  So <
line 6204=>bour  hard  in  fortifying  the  main  entrance,  and  in  remaking <
line 6205=>the  road  that  led  from  it.  Tools  were  to  be  found  in  plenty  that  the  miners  and <
line 6206=>quarriers  and  builders  of  old  had  used;  and  at  such  work  the  dwarves  were  still <
line 6207=>very skilled. <
line 6208=>As  they  worked  the  ravens  brought  them  constant  tidings.  In  this  way  they <

line 6217=>pes were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care-chiefly cram, <
line 6218=>of course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better than nothing-and <
line 6219=>already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick <
line 6220=>across  the  opening.  There  were  holes  in  the  wall  through  which  they <

line 6222=>hath ropes. For the issuing of the stream they had contrived a small <
line 6223=> but near the entrance they had so altered the narrow <
line 6224=>bed  that  a wide pool  stretched  from  the mountain-wall to the head of the fall over <

line 6226=>possible, wit along  a narrow  ledge of  the  cliff,  to  the  right  as one <
line 6227=>l.  The  ponies  they  had  brought  only  to  the  head  of <
line 6228=>the  steps  above  the  old  bridge,  and  unloading  them  there  had  bidden  them  return <
line 6229=>to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South. <
line 6230=>There  came  a  night  when  suddenly  there  were  many  lights  as  of  fires  and <
line 6231=>0h in Dale before them. <
line 6232=>"They  have  come!"  called  Balin.  "And  their  camp  is  very  great.  They  must <
line 6233=>ha valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river." <
line 6234=>That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when they saw a <
line 6235=>company approaching. From behind  their wall  they watched  them come up  to  the <
line 6236=>wly up. Before long they could see that both men of the <
line 6237=>lake  armed  as  if  for  war  and  elvish  bowmen  were  among  them.  At  length  the <
line 6238=>foremost  of  these  climbed  the  tumbled  rocks  and  appeared  at  the  top  of  the  falls; <
line 6239=>and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate blocked <
line 6240=>with a wall of new-hewn stone. <
line 6241=>0d speaking to one another Thorin hailed them: "Who <
line 6242=>he  called  in  a  very  loud  voice,  "that  come  as  if  in  war  to  the  gates  of <
line 6243=>Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you desire?" <
line 6244=> Some  turned  swiftly  back,  and  the  others  after <
line 6245=>gazing  for  a while  at  the Gate  and  its  defences  soon  followed  them. That  day  the <
line 6246=>camp was moved  and was  brought  right  between  the  arms  of  the Mountain.  The <
line 6247=>rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day. <
line 6248=>###-There was  the  sound,  too,  of  elven-harps and of sweet music; and as  it echoed up <
line 6249=>towards  them  it  seemed  that  the  chill  of  the  air  was  warmed,  and  they  caught <
line 6250=>faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring. <
line 6251=>Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in <
line 6252=>  by  the  fires.  Some  of  the  younger  dwarves were moved  in <
line 6253=>ey  muttered  that  they  wished  things  had  fallen  out <
line 6254=>otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but Thorin scowled. <
line 6255=>Then  the  dwarves  themselves  brought  forth  harps  and  instruments  regained <
line 6256=>from  the  hoard,  and  made  music  to  soften  his  mood;  but  their  song  was  not  as <

line 6290=>he began reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be before <
line 6291=>the  Lonely Mountain,  if  he  had  set  out  as  soon  as  the message <

line 6293=>e  next  morning  early  a  company  of  spearmen  was  seen <
line 6294=>crossing  the  river,  and  marching  up  the  valley.  They  bore  with  them  the  green <

line 6296=>they stood right before the wall at the Gate. <
line 6297=> wall at the Gate.  Thorin hailed  them  in a  loud voice: "Who are you  that come armed for <
line 6298=>war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain?" This time he <
line 6299=>was answered. <
line 6300=>A  tall  man  stood  forward,  dark  of  hair  and  grim  of  face,  and  he  cried:  "Hail <
line 6301=>e yourself like a robber in his hold? We are not yet foes, <
line 6302=>and  we  rejoice  that  you  are  alive  beyond  our  hope.  We  came  expecting  to  find <
line 6303=>none  living  here;  yet  now  that  we  are  met  there  is  matter  for  a  parley  and  a <
line 6304=>council." <
line 6305=>"Who are you, and of what would you parley?" <
line 6306=>nd of what would you parley?" y my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure delivered. <
line 6307=>Is that not a matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by right descent the heir of <
line 6308=>  and  in your hoard  is mingled much of  the wealth of his halls  and <
line 6309=>town,  which  of  old  Smaug  stole.  Is  not  that  a  matter  of  which  we  may  speak? <
line 6310=>le  Smaug  destroyed  the  dwellings  of  the men  of  Esgaroth, <
line 6311=> of  their Master.  I would  speak  for  him  and  ask whether <
line 6312=>you  have  no  thought  for  the  sorrow  and misery  of  his  people.  They  aided  you  in <
line 6313=>your  distress,  and  in  recompense  you  have  thus  far  brought  ruin  only,  though <
line 6314=>doubtless undesigned." <
line 6315=>Now  these were  fair words and  true,  if proudly and grimly  spoken; and Bilbo <
line 6316=>thought  that Thorin would at once admit what  justice was  in  them. He did not, of <
line 6317=> expect  that  any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by <
line 6318=> weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did. But <
line 6319=> power that gold has upon which a dragon has long <

line 6324=>lying there, about which were wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows <
line 6325=> put  your worst  cause  last  and  in  the  chief  place," Thorin  answered.  "To <

line 6328=>  share  of  it.  The  price  of  the  goods  and  the  assistance <

line 6330=>we  give,  not  even  a  loaf's  worth,  under  threat  of  force. While  an  armed host  lies <
line 6331=>before our doors, we look on you as foes and thieves. <
line 6332=>"It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to <
line 6333=>hoard unguarded and us slain." <
line 6334=>"A just question," replied Bard. "But you are not dead, and we are not robbers. <
line 6335=>wealthy  may  have  pity  beyond  right  on  the  needy  that  befriended <
line 6336=>them when they were in want. And still my other claims remain unanswered." <
line 6337=>"I will  not  parley,  as  I  have  said, with  armed men  at my  gate. Nor  at all with <
line 6338=>he Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In this debate <
line 6339=>w ere our arrows fly! And if you would speak with <
line 6340=>me  again,  first  dismiss  the  elvish  host  to  the  woods  where  it  belongs,  and  then <
line 6341=>return, laying down your arms before you approach the threshold." <
line 6342=>"The Elvenking  is my  friend,  and  he  has  succoured  the  people  of  the Lake  in <
line 6343=>they had no claim but friendship on him," answered Bard. "We <
line 6344=>will  give  you  time  to  repent  your  words.  Gather  your  wisdom  ere  we  return!" <
line 6345=>Then he departed and went back to the camp. <
line 6346=>he departed and went back to the camp. t,  the  banner-bearers  returned,  and  trumpeters  stood <
line 6347=>forth and blew a blast: <
line 6348=>"In  the  name  of  Esgaroth  and  the  Forest,"  one  cried,  "we  speak  unto  Thorin <
line 6349=>Thrain's  son  Oakenshield,  calling  himself  the  King  under  the  Mountain,  and  we <
line 6350=>bid him consider well  the claims  that have been urged, or be declared our  foe. At <
line 6351=>e  least  he  shall  deliver  one  twelfth  portion  of  the  treasure  unto  Bard,  as  the <

line 6354=>honour of the lands about, as his sires had of old, then he will give also somewhat <
line 6355=>of his own  for  the comfort of  the men of  the Lake." Then Thorin seized a bow of <

line 6376=>Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time <
line 6377=>piling  ae  treasure;  and  now  Thorin  spoke  of  the  Arkenstone  of <
line 6378=>Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every comer.  <
line 6379=>"For the Arkenstone of my father," he said, "is worth more than a river of gold <

line 6384=>a pillow. All the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew <
line 6385=>heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his little head. <
line 6386=>Things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news that <

line 6401=>he  climbed  to  the  top  of  the  wall.  Only  Bombur  was  there,  for  it  was  his  turn to <

line 6425=>Fili  or  Kili,  would  come out on  the wall until  it was  their  turn.  It was very dark, <

line 6497=>"O  well!"  said  the  hobbit  uncomfortably.  "It  isn't  exactly;  but,  well,  I  am <
line 6498=>willing  to  let  it  stand  against  all my claim, don't you know. I may be a burglar-or <
line 6499=>so  they  say: personally  I never  really  felt  like one-but I am an honest one, I hope, <
line 6500=>more  or  less.  Anyway  I  am  going  back  now,  and  the  dwarves  can  do  what  they <
line 6501=>like to me. I hope you will find it useful." <
line 6502=> will find it useful." ing looked at Bilbo with a new wonder.  <
line 6503=>"Bilbo  Baggins!"  he  said.  "You  are  more  worthy  to  wear  the  armour  of  elf-<
line 6504=>princes  than  many  that  have  looked  more  comely  in  it.  But  I  wonder  if  Thorin <
line 6505=>nshield will see it so. I have more knowledge of dwarves  in general than you <
line 6506=>have perhaps. I advise you to remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and <
line 6507=>ry much I am sure," said Bilbo with a bow. "But I don't think I <

line 6516=>bout you than anyone expects!" It was Gandalf. <
line 6517=>yone expects!" It was Gandalf. me for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was no <
line 6518=>time for all the questions that he immediately wished to ask. <
line 6519=>0All  in  good  time!"  said  Gandalf.  "Things  are  drawing  towards  the  end  now, <
line 6520=>unless  I  am  mistaken.  There  is  an  unpleasant  time  just  in  front  of  you;  but  keep <
line 6521=>your heart up! You may  come  through  all  right. There  is news brewing  that  even <
line 6522=>the ravens have not heard. Good night!" <
line 6523=>d. Good night!"  but  cheered.  Bilbo  hurried  on.  He  was  guided  to  a  safe  ford  and  set <
line 6524=>across  dry,  and  then  he  said  farewell  to  the  elves  and  climbed  carefully  back <
line 6525=>towards the Gate. Great weariness began to come over him; but it was well before <
line 6526=> the  rope  again  â€“  it was  still where he had  left  it. <
line 6527=>He untied  it and hid  it, and  then he sat down on the wall and wondered anxiously <
line 6528=>what would happen next. <
line 6529=>At  midnight  he  woke  up  Bombur;  and  then  in  turn  rolled  himself  up  in  his <
line 6530=>corner,  without  listening  to  old  dwarfs  thanks  (which  he  felt  he  had  hardly <
line 6531=>rned).  He  was  soon  fast  asleep  forgetting  all  his  worries  till  the  morning.  As <

line 6540=>his  coming.  I  thought  that would  alter  their mood! Bid them come few in number <

line 6542=>About  midday  the  banners  of  the  Forest  and  the  Lake  were  seen  to  be  borne <

line 6545=>Wondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both Bard and the Elvenking, <
line 6546=>wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of iron-<
line 6547=>bound wood. <
line 6548=>Are you still of the same mind?" <
line 6549=>e you still of the same mind?" the rising and setting of a few suns," answered <

line 6553=>"Nothing that you or your friends have to offer." <
line 6554=> Thrain?" said he, and at the same moment the old <
line 6555=>man  opened  the  casket  and  held  aloft  the  jewel.  The  light  leapt  from  his  hand, <
line 6556=>e in the morning. <
line 6557=>Then Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one spoke <
line 6558=>for  a  long while. Thorin  at  length broke  the  silence,  and his voice was  thick with <
line 6559=>wrath. "That stone was my father's, and is mine," he said. "Why should I purchase <
line 6560=>my  own?"  But  wonder  overcame  him  and  he  added:  "But  how  came  you  by  the <
line 6561=>heirloom of m is need to ask such a question of thieves?" <
line 6562=>"We  are  not  thieves," Bard  answered.  "Your  own we will  give  back  in  return <
line 6563=>for our own." <
line 6564=>'How came you by it?" shouted Thorin in gathering rage. <
line 6565=>ueaked Bilbo, who was peeping over the wall, by now, in a <
line 6566=>dreadful fright. <
line 6567=> cried  Thorin,  turning  upon  him  and  grasping  him  with  both <

line 6570=> Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his choice of <
line 6571=>you! May his beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!" he cried and <
line 6572=>lifted Bilbo in his arms. <
line 6573=>"Stay! Your wish is granted!" said a voice. The old man with the casket threw <
line 6574=>ide  his  hood  and  cloak.  "Here  is  Gandalf!  And  none  too  soon  it  seems.  If  you <
line 6575=>don't  like my Burglar, please don't damage him. Put him down,  and  listen first  to <
line 6576=>what he has to say!" <
line 6577=>"You  all  seem  in  league!"  said  Thorin  dropping  Bilbo  on  the  top  of  the wall. <
line 6578=>"Never  again will  I  have  dealings with  any wizard  or  his  friends. What  have  you <
line 6579=>to say, you descendant of rats?" <

line 6587=>d let it go at that!" horin  grimly.  "And  I will  let  you  go  at  that-and may we never <
line 6588=>meet again!" Then he turned and spoke over the wall. "I am betrayed," he said. "It <
line 6589=>was rightly guessed that I could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure <
line 6590=> it I will give one fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, <

line 6603=>of  the  treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might <

line 6605=>hhold the share of the reward. s  swung  down  from  the  wall,  and  departed  with  nothing  for <

line 6608=>"Farewell!" he cried to them. "We may meet again as friends." <
line 6609=>"Be  off!"  called  Thorin.  "You  have  mail  upon  you,  which  was  made  by  my <
line 6610=>folk,  and  is  too  good  for  you.  It  cannot  be  pierced  .by  arrows;  but  if  you  do  not <

line 6612=>0aid Bard. "We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will <
line 6613=>return,  and  see  if  you  have  brought  from  the  hoard  the  portion  that  is  to  be  set <
line 6614=>against  the  stone.  If  that  is  done  without  deceit,  then  we  will  depart,  and  the  elf-<
line 6615=>host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!" <
line 6616=>With  that  they  went  back  to  the  camp;  but  Thorin  sent  messengers  by  RÃ³ac <
line 6617=> Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed. <
line 6618=>The next day the wind shifted west, and the air <
line 6619=>was  dark  and  gloomy.  The  morning  was  still  early  when  a  cry  was  heard  in  the <
line 6620=>me  in  to  report  that  a  host  of  dwarves  had  appeared  round  the <
line 6621=>easteMountain and was now hastening  to Dale. Dain had come. He <
line 6622=>had  hurried  on  through  the  night,  and  so  had  come  upon  them  sooner  than  they <
line 6623=>had expected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to <
line 6624=>his  knees,  and  his  legs were  covered with  hose  of  a  fine  and  flexible metal mesh, <
line 6625=>the saking was possessed by Dain's people. <
line 6626=>ing was possessed by Dain's people. ingly  strong  for  their  height,  but  most  of  these  were <
line 6627=>strong  even  for  dwarves.  In  battle  they  wielded  heavy  two-handed mattocks;  but <
line 6628=>each of  them had also a  short broad  sword at his  side and a  round  shield  slung at <
line 6629=>his  back.  Their  beards  were  forked  and  plaited  and  thrust  into  their  belts.  Their <
line 6630=>caps  were  of  iron  and  they  were  shod  with  iron,  and  their  faces  were  grim. <
line 6631=>Trumpets  called  men  and  elves  to  arms.  Before  long  the  dwarves  could  be  seen <
line 6632=>coming  up  the  valley  at  a  great  pace.  They  halted  between  the  river  and  the <
line 6633=> held  on  their  way,  and  crossing  the  river  drew  near  the <
line 6634=>camp;  and  there  they  laid  down  their weapons  and  held  up  their  hands  in  sign  of <
line 6635=>peace. Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo. <
line 6636=>"We  are  sent  from  Dain  son  of  Nain,"  they  said  when  questioned.  "We  are <
line 6637=>hastening  to our kinsmen  in  the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old <
line 6638=> are  you  that  sit  in  the  plain  as  foes  before  defended walls?" <

line 6644=>Mountain. He  to wait  until  the  gold  and  silver  had  been  brought <
line 6645=>out in exchange for the Arkenstone: for he did not believe that this would be done, <
line 6646=>if  once  the  fortress  was manned  with  so  large  and  warlike  a  company.  They  had <
line 6647=> a great store of supplies; for  the dwarves can carry very heavy <
line 6648=>burdens,  andf  Dain's  folks,  in  spite  of  their  rapid  march,  bore  huge <
line 6649=> addition  to  their  weapons.  They  would  stand  a  siege  for <
line 6650=>et more dwarves might  come,  and yet more,  for Thorin <
line 6651=>had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard some other gate, <
line 6652=> would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they <
line 6653=>had not sufficient numbers. <
line 6654=>These  were,  in  fact,  precisely  their  plans  (for  the  raven-messengers  had  been <
line 6655=>busy between Thorin and Dain); but  for  the moment  the way was barred, so after <

line 6675=><
line 6676=>####-Still  more  suddenly  a  darkness  came  on  with  dreadful  swiftness!  A  black <
line 6677=>cloud  hurried  over  the  sky. Winter  thunder  on  a wild wind  rolled  roaring  up  and <
line 6678=>rumbled  in  the  Mountain,  and  lightning  lit  its  peak.  And  beneath  the  thunder <
line 6679=>  could  be  seen  whirling  forward;  but  it  did  not  come  with  the <
line 6680=>  the  North,  like  a  vast  cloud  of  birds,  so  dense  that  no  light <
line 6681=>en their wings. <
line 6682=> Gandalf,  who  appeared  suddenly,  and  stood  alone,  with  arms <
line 6683=>ncing dwarves and  the  ranks awaiting  them. "Halt!" he <
line 6684=>called  in  a  voice  like  thunder,  and  his  staff  blazed  forth  with  a  flash  like  the <
line 6685=>lightning.  "Dread  has  come  upon  you  all!  Alas!  it  has  come  more  swiftly  than  I <
line 6686=>guessed. The Goblins  are upon you! Bolg*  of the North is coming. O Dain! whose <
line 6687=>father  you  slew  in  Moria.  Behold!  the  bats  are  above  his  army  like  a  sea  of <
line 6688=>locusts. They ride upon wolves and Wargs are in their train!" <
line 6689=>Amazement  and  confusion  fell  upon  them  all.  Even  as  Gandalf  had  been <

line 6695=>So  began  a  battle  that  none  had  expected; and  it was called  the Battle of Five <
line 6696=>Armies,  and  it  was  very  terrible.  Upon  one  side  were  the  Goblins  and  the  wild <
line 6697=>Wolves, and upon  the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This  is how  it  fell <
line 6698=>ll  of  the Great Goblin  of  the Misty Mountains  the hatred of <
line 6699=>  had  been  rekindled  to  fury. Messengers  had  passed  to <
line 6700=>and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to <
line 6701=>win  the  dominion  of  the  North.  Tidings  they  had  gathered  in  secret  ways; and  in <
line 6702=>all  the  mountains  there  was  a  forging  and  an  arming.  Then  they  marched  and <
line 6703=>d valley, going  ever by  tunnel or under dark, until  around  and <
line 6704=>beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, a vast <
line 6705=>host  was  assembled  ready  to  sweep  down  in  time  of  storm  unawares  upon  the <
line 6706=>South. Then  they  learned of  the death of Smaug,  and  joy was  in  their hearts:  and <
line 6707=>ter night  through  the mountains,  and  came  thus  at  last on  a <
line 6708=>ard  on  the  heels  of  Dain.  Not  even  the  ravens  knew  of <
line 6709=>their  coming me  out  in  the  broken  lands  which  divided  the  Lonely <

line 6717=>  between  the  arms  of  the Mountain;  and  themselves  to <
line 6718=>man  the  great  spurs  that  struck  south  and  east. Yet  this would  be  perilous,  if  the <
line 6719=>goblins  were  in  sufficient  numbers  to  overrun  the  Mountain  itself,  and  so  attack <

line 6726=>n  the Southern spur,  in  its  lower slopes and  in  the  rocks at  its  feet,  the Elves <
line 6727=>  set;  on  the  Eastern  spur  were men  and  dwarves.  But  Bard  and  some  of  the <
line 6728=>nimblest of men and elves climbed  to  the height of  the Eastern  shoulder  to gain a <
line 6729=>rth. Soon  they could see  the  lands before  the Mountain's  feet black <

line 6731=>came  rushing  into  Dale.  These  were  the  swiftest  wolf-riders,  and  already  their <
line 6732=>cries  and  howls  rent  the  air  afar.  A  few  brave  men  were  strung  before  them  to <
line 6733=>make  a  feint  of  resistance,  and many  there  fell  before  the  rest  drew  back  and fled <
line 6734=>to  either  side.  As  Gandalf  had  hoped,  the  goblin  army  had  gathered  behind  the <
line 6735=>resisted  vanguard,  and  poured  now  in  rage  into  the  valley,  driving  wildly  up <
line 6736=>between  the  arms  of  the  Mountain,  seeking  for  the  foe.  Their  banners  were <

line 6738=>It  was  a  terrible  battle.  The  most  dreadful  of  all  Bilbo's  experiences,  and  the <
line 6739=>the  time he hated most  â€“ which is to say it was the one he was most <
line 6740=>fond  of  recalling  long  afterwards,  although  he  was  quite <
line 6741=>unimportant inmust say he put on his ring early in the business, and <
line 6742=>vanished  from  sight,  if  not  from  all  danger.  A  magic  ring  of  that  sort  is  not  a <
line 6743=>complete  protection  in  a  goblin  charge,  nor  does  it  stop  flying  arrows  and  wild <
line 6744=>spears;  but  it  does  help  in  getting  out  of  the way,  and  it  prevents  your  head  from <
line 6745=>being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman. <
line 6746=>The  elves  were  the  first  to  charge.  Their  hatred  for  the  goblins  is  cold  and <
line 6747=>r. Their spears and swords shone  in  the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so <
line 6748=>deadly  was  the  wrath  of  the  hands  that  held  them.  As  soon  as  the  host  of  their <
line 6749=>se  in  the valley,  they sent against  it a shower of arrows, and each <
line 6750=><
line 6751=>####-flickered  as  it  fled  as  if with  stinging  fire.  Behind  the  arrows  a  thousand  of  their <
line 6752=>spearmen  leapt  down  and  charged.  The  yells  were  deafening.  The  rocks  were <
line 6753=>oblin  blood.  Just  as  the  goblins  were  recovering  from  the <
line 6754=>rge was halted,  there  rose  from across  the valley a deep-<
line 6755=>throated  roar. With  cries  of  "Moria!"  and  "Dain,  Dain!"  the  dwarves  of  the  Iron <
line 6756=>Hills  plunged  in,  wielding  their  mattocks,  upon  the  other  side;  and  beside  them <
line 6757=>came  the  men  of  the  Lake  with  long  swords.  Panic  came  upon  the Goblins;  and <
line 6758=>even as they turned to meet this new attack, the elves charged again with renewed <
line 6759=>numbers. Already many of  the goblins were  flying back down  the  river  to  escape <
line 6760=>from the trap: and many of their own wolves were turning upon them and rending <
line 6761=>wounded.  Victory  seemed  at  hand,  when  a  cry  rang  out  on  the <
line 6762=>heights above. <
line 6763=>Goblins  had  scaled  the Mountain  from  the  other  side  and  already many were <
line 6764=>on the slopes above the Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless <
line 6765=>0f  those  that  fell  screaming  from  cliff  and  precipice,  to  attack  the  spurs  from <
line 6766=>above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down from the main mass <
line 6767=>in  the  centre;  and  the  defenders  had  too  few  to  bar  the  way  for <
line 6768=>lo vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the first onslaught <
line 6769=>of the black tide. <
line 6770=>Day drew on. The goblins gathered again  in  the valley. There a host of Wargs <
line 6771=>hem  came  the  bodyguard  of  Bolg,  goblins  of  huge  size <
line 6772=>with scimitars of steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while <
line 6773=>at bats  swirled  about  the heads  and  ears of  elves  and men, or  fastened <
line 6774=>  the  stricken.  Now  Bard  was  fighting  to  defend  the  Eastern  spur, <
line 6775=>andly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the <
line 6776=>h-post on Ravenhill. <
line 6777=>Suddenly  there  was  a  great  shout,  and  from  the  Gate  came  a  trumpet  call. <
line 6778=>Thorin! Part of  the wall, moved by  levers, fell outward with a <
line 6779=>crash  into  teapt  the King  under  the Mountain,  and  his  companions <
line 6780=>followed  him.  Hood  and  cloak  were  gone;  they  were  in  shining  armour,  and  red <
line 6781=>light  leapt  from  their  eyes.  In  the  gloom  the  great  dwarf  gleamed  like  gold  in  a <
line 6782=>dying fire. <
line 6783=>Rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on. <
line 6784=>leapt  down  to  the  falls'  foot,  and  rushed  forward  to  battle. Wolf  and  rider  fell  or <
line 6785=>fled before them. Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed <
line 6786=>to harm him. <
line 6787=><
line 6788=>####-"To  me!  To  me!  Elves  and  Men!  To  me!  O  my  kinsfolk!"  he  cried,  and  his <
line 6789=>ke a horn in the valley.  <
line 6790=>Down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too <
line 6791=>came  many  of  the  Lake-men,  for Bard  could  not  restrain  them;  and out upon  the <
line 6792=>the  spearmen  of  the  elves. Once  again  the  goblins were <
line 6793=>stricken in the valley; and they were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous <
line 6794=> corpses.  The  Wargs  were  scattered  and  Thorin  drove  right  against  the <
line 6795=> Bolg.  But  he  could  not  pierce  their  ranks.  Already  behind  him <
line 6796=>lay many men and many dwarves, and many a fair elf that <
line 6797=>should  have  lived  yet  long  ages  merrily  in  the  wood.  And  as  the  valley  widened <
line 6798=>his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were too few. His flanks were unguarded. <
line 6799=>Soon  the  attackers  were  attacked,  and  they  were  forced  into  a  great  ring,  facing <
line 6800=>every  w  about  with  goblins  and  wolves  returning  to  the  assault. <
line 6801=>wling against them, and drove in upon their ranks <
line 6802=>like waves  upon  cliffs  of  sand.  Their  friends  could  not  help  them,  for  the  assault <
line 6803=>untain was  renewed with  redoubled  force,  and  upon  either  side men <
line 6804=>lowly beaten down. <
line 6805=>On  all  this  Bilbo  looked  with  misery.  He  had  taken  his  stand  on  Ravenhill <
line 6806=>amontly because  there was more chance of escape from  that point, <
line 6807=>and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be <
line 6808=>in  a  last  desperate  stand,  he  preferred  on  the  whole  to  defend  the  Elvenking. <
line 6809=>0  may  say,  was  there,  sitting  on  the  ground  as  if  in  deep  thought, <
line 6810=>uppose,  some  last  blast  of magic  before  the  end.  That  did  not  seem <
line 6811=>0 not be  long now,"  thought Bilbo, "before the goblins win the Gate, <
line 6812=>0tered  or  driven  down  and  captured.  Really  it  is  enough  to <
line 6813=>l  one  has  gone  through.  I  would  rather  old  Smaug  had <
line 6814=>been left with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, <
line 6815=>and  poor  old Bombur,  and Balin  and  Fili  and Kili  and  all  the  rest  come  to  a  bad <
line 6816=>end;  and  Bard  too,  and  the  Lake-men  and  the  merry  elves.  Misery  me!  I  have <
line 6817=>heard  songs  of  many  battles,  and  I  have  always  understood  that  defeat  may  be <
line 6818=>glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I was well out <
line 6819=>of it." <
line 6820=>The  clouds  were  torn  by  the  wind,  and  a  red  sunset  slashed  the West.  Seeing <
line 6821=>the  sudden  gleam  in  the  gloom  Bilbo  looked  round. He  gave  a  great  cry:  he  had <
line 6822=>seen  a  sight  that  made  his  heart  leap,  dark  shapes  small  yet  majestic  against  the <
line 6823=> The Eagles!" he shouted. "The Eagles are coming!" <
line 6824=><
line 6825=>####-Bilbo's eyes were seldom wrong. The eagles were coming down the wind, line <
line 6826=> as must have gathered from all the eyries of the North. <
line 6827=>"The  Eagles!  the  Eagles!"  Bilbo  cried,  dancing  and  waving  his  arms.  If  the <
line 6828=>elves could not see him they could hear him. Soon they too took up the cry, and it <
line 6829=>echoed  across  the  valley. Many wondering  eyes  looked up,  though as yet nothing <
line 6830=>d be seen except from the southern shoulders of the Mountain. <
line 6831=>"The Eagles!" cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from <
line 6832=>aby on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no more. <
line 6833=>-<h4>Chapter 18</h4> <br> <

line 6835=>The Return Journey <
line 6836=>me  to himself, he was  literally by himself. He was  lying on  the <
line 6837=>flat stones of Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was broad <
line 6838=>him. He was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned with fire. <
line 6839=> has happened?" he said to himself. "At any rate I am not <
line 6840=>yet one of the fallen heroes; but I suppose there is still time enough for that!" <
line 6841=>ully.  Looking  into  the  valley  he  could  see  no  living  goblins. <
line 6842=>After  ead cleared a  little, he  thought he could see elves moving  in <
line 6843=>  his  eyes.  Surely  there  was  a  camp  still  in  the  plain <
line 6844=>re  was  a  coming  and  going  about  the  Gate?  Dwarves <
line 6845=>seemed  to  be  busy  removing  the wall. But  all was deadly  still. There was no  call <
line 6846=>and  no  echo  of  a  song.  Sorrow  seemed  to  be  in  the  air.  "Victory  after  all,  I <
line 6847=>suppose!"  he  said,  feeling  his  aching  head.  "Well,  it  seems  a  very  gloomy <
line 6848=>he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him. <
line 6849=>o there!" he called with a shaky voice. "Hullo there! What news?" <
line 6850=>peaks  among  the  stones?"  said  the  man  halting  and <
line 6851=>peering about him not far from where Bilbo sat. <
line 6852=>d his ring! "Well I'm blessed!" said he. "This invisibility <
line 6853=>has  its  drawbacks  after  all.  Otherwise  I  suppose  I  might  have  spent  a  warm  and <
line 6854=>comfortable night in bed!" <
line 6855=>"It's me, Bilbo Baggins,  companion  of Thorin!"  he  cried,  hurriedly  taking  off <
line 6856=>the ring. <
line 6857=>"It  is  well  that  I  have  found  you!"  said  the  man  striding  forward.  "You  are <
line 6858=> have looked for you long. You would have been numbered among <
line 6859=>the  dead,  who  are many,  if  Gandalf  the  wizard  had  not  said  that  your  voice  was <
line 6860=>last  heard  in  this  place.  I  have  been  sent  to  look  here  for  the  last  time.  Are  you <
line 6861=>much hurt?" <
line 6862=>"A  nasty  knock  on  the  head,  I  think,"  said  Bilbo.  "But  I  have  a  helm  and  a <
line 6863=>hard ame I feel sick and my legs are like straws." <
line 6864=>"I  will  carry  you  down  to  the  camp  in  the  valley,"  said  the man,  and  picked <
line 6865=>him lightly up. <
line 6866=>The man was swift and sure-footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set down <
line 6867=>before  a  tent  in Dale;  and  there  stood Gandalf, with  his  arm  in  a  sling.  Even  the <
line 6868=><
line 6869=>####-wizard had not escaped without a wound; and  there were  few unharmed in all the <
line 6870=>host. <
line 6871=>When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted. "Baggins!" he exclaimed. "Well I <
line 6872=>never! Alive after all â€“ 1 am glad! I began to wonder if even your luck would see <
line 6873=> business, and it nearly was disastrous. But other news can <
line 6874=>wait. Come!" he said more gravely. "You are called for;" and leading the hobbit he <
line 6875=> the tent. <
line 6876=>"Hail! Thorin," he said as he entered. "I have brought him." <
line 6877=>There  indeed  lay  Thorin  Oakenshield,  wounded  with  many  wounds,  and  his <
line 6878=>  armour  and  notched  axe  were  cast  upon  the  floor.  He  looked  up  as  Bilbo <
line 6879=>came beside him. <
line 6880=>"Farewell,  good  thief,"  he  said.  "I  go  now  to  the  halls  of waiting  to  sit  beside <
line 6881=>my  fathers,  until  the world  is  renewed. Since  I  leave  now  all  gold  and  silver,  and <
line 6882=>go  wh little  worth,  I  wish  to  part  in  friendship  from  you,  and  I  would <
line 6883=>take back my words and deeds at the Gate." <
line 6884=>s at the Gate."   knelt  on  one  knee  filled  with  sorrow.  "Farewell,  King  under  the <
line 6885=>d.  "This  is  a  bitter  adventure,  if  it  must  end  so;  and  not  a <
line 6886=>mountain  of  gold  can  amend  it. Yet  I  am  glad  that  I  have  shared  in  your  perils  â€“ <
line 6887=>0e than any Baggins deserves." <
line 6888=>"No!" said Thorin. "There  is more  in you of good  than you know, child of  the <
line 6889=>kindly West. Some  courage  and  some wisdom, blended  in measure.  If more of us <
line 6890=>ng above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. <
line 6891=>But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!" <
line 6892=>,  and  he went  by  himself,  and  sat  alone wrapped  in  a <
line 6893=>blanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and his <
line 6894=>voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long before he had the <
line 6895=>heart to make a joke again. "A mercy it is," he said at last to himself, "that I woke <
line 6896=>re living, but I am glad that we parted in kindness. <
line 6897=>You  are  a  fool,  Bilbo  Baggins,  and  you made  a  great mess  of  that  business with <
line 6898=> there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, <
line 6899=>but I suppose you can hardly be blamed for that." <
line 6900=>All  that  had  happened  after  he  was  stunned,  Bilbo  learned  later;  but  it  gave <
line 6901=>him more sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching <
line 6902=>in  his  bones  for  the  homeward  journey. That,  however, was  a  little  delayed, so  in <
line 6903=>0something of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion of <
line 6904=>the  goblins'  mustering;  from  their  watchfulness  the  movements  in  the  mountains <
line 6905=>could not be altogether hid. So  they  too had gathered  in great numbers, under  the <
line 6906=><
line 6907=>####-great  Eagle  of  the Misty Mountains;  and  at  length  smelling  battle  from  afar  they <
line 6908=>had come  speeding down  the gale  in  the nick of  time. They  it was who dislodged <
line 6909=>untain-slopes,  casting  them  over  precipices,  or  driving <
line 6910=>them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It was not long before they <
line 6911=>  Lonely  Mountain,  and  elves  and  men  on  either  side  of  the  valley <
line 6912=>could come at last to the help of the battle below.  <
line 6913=>y were still outnumbered. <
line 6914=>hat  last  hour  Beorn  himself  had  appeared  â€“  no  one  knew  how  or  from <
line 6915=>me  alone,  and  in  bear's  shape;  and  he  seemed  to  have  grown  almost <
line 6916=>to  giant-size  in  his wrath. The  roar  of  his  voice was  like  drums  and  guns;  and  he <
line 6917=>0nd  goblins  from  his  path  like  straws  and  feathers.  He  fell  upon <
line 6918=>their  rear,  and  broke  like  a  clap  of  thunder  through  the  ring.  The  dwarves  were <
line 6919=>ll  about  their  lords  upon  a  low  rounded  hill.  Then  Beorn <
line 6920=>stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of <
line 6921=>y.  Swiftly  he  returned  and  his  wrath  was  redoubled,  so  that  nothing  could <
line 6922=>withstand  him,  and  no  weapon  seemed  to  bite  upon  him.  He  scattered  the <
line 6923=>bodyguard,  and  pulled  down Bolg  himself  and  crushed  him. Then  dismay  fell  on <
line 6924=>the  Goblins  and  they  fled  in  all  directions.  But  weariness  left  their  enemies  with <
line 6925=> and  they  pursued  them  closely,  and  prevented  most  of <
line 6926=>them from escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the Running <
line 6927=>Ri fled south or west they hunted into the marshes about the Forest <
line 6928=>ter  part  of  the  last  fugitives  perished,  while  those  that <
line 6929=>came  hardly  to  the Wood-elves'  realm  were  there  slain,  or  drawn  in  to  die  in  the <
line 6930=>trackless  dark  of  Mirkwood.  Songs  have  said  that  three  parts  of  the  goblin <
line 6931=>iors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many <
line 6932=> had  been  assured  before  the  fall  of  night,  but  the  pursuit  was  still  on <
line 6933=>0n  Bilbo  returned  to  the  camp;  and not many were  in  the valley  save  the <
line 6934=>more grievously wounded. <
line 6935=>es?" he asked Gandalf  that evening, as he  lay wrapped  in <
line 6936=>many warm blankets. <
line 6937=>"Some  are  in  the  hunt,"  said  the  wizard,  "but  most  have  gone  back  to  their <
line 6938=>  not  stay  here,  and  departed  with  the  first  light  of  morning. <
line 6939=> chief with gold, and sworn friendship with them for ever." <
line 6940=>"I  am  sorry.  I  mean,  I  should  have  liked  to  see  them  again,"  said  Bilbo <
line 6941=>sleepily;  "perhaps  I  shall  see  them  on  the  way  home.  I  suppose  I  shall  be  going <
line 6942=>home soon?" <
line 6943=><
line 6944=>####-"As soon as you like," said the wizard. <
line 6945=> you like," said the wizard. some days before Bilbo really set out. <
line 6946=>beneath the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone <
line 6947=>upon his breast. <
line 6948=> Mountain falls!" he said. "May it bring good fortune to <
line 6949=>all his  folk  that dwell here after!" Upon his  tomb  the Elvenking  then  laid Orcrist, <
line 6950=>the  elvish  sword  that  had  been  taken  from  Thorin  in  captivity.  It  is  said  in  songs <
line 6951=>that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves <
line 6952=>could  not  be  taken  by  surprise.  There  now  Dain  son  of  Nain  took  up  his  abode, <
line 6953=>and  he  became  King  under  the  Mountain,  and  in  time  many  other  dwarves <
line 6954=>gathered  to  his  throne  in  the  ancient  halls.  Of  the  twelve  companions  of  Thorin, <
line 6955=>ten  remained. Fili  and Kili  had  fallen  defending  him with  shield  and  body,  for  he <
line 6956=>was their mother's elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his <
line 6957=>treasure well. There was,  of  course,  no  longer  any  question of dividing  the hoard <
line 6958=>had been planned,  to Balin  and Dwalin,  and Dori  and Nori  and <
line 6959=>Ori,  and  Oiand  Bifur  and  Bofur  and  Bombur-or  to  Bilbo.  Yet  a <
line 6960=>fourteenth  share of  all  the  silver  and gold, wrought  and unwrought, was given up <
line 6961=>to  Bard;  for  Dain  said:  "We  will  honour  the  agreement  of  the  dead,  and  he  has <
line 6962=>now the Arkenstone in his keeping." <
line 6963=>is keeping." fourteenth  share  was  wealth  exceedingly  great,  greater  than  that  of <
line 6964=>s.  From  that  treasure  Bard  sent  much  gold  to  the  Master  of <
line 6965=>0d his followers and friends freely. To the Elvenking he <
line 6966=>he  emeralds  of  Girion,  such  jewels  as  he  most  loved,  which  Dain  had <
line 6967=>im.  To  Bilbo  he  said:  "This  treasure  is  as  much  yours  as  it  is  mine; <
line 6968=>though  old  agreements  cannot  stand,  since  so  many  have  a  claim  in  its  winning <
line 6969=>et  even  though  you  were  willing  to  lay  aside  all  your  claim,  I <
line 6970=>should wish that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not prove true: <
line 6971=>that we should give you little. I would reward you most richly of all." <
line 6972=>"Very  kind  of  you,"  said  Bilbo.  "But  really  it  is  a  relief  to me. How  on  earth <
line 6973=>0  that  treasure  home  without  war  and  murder  all  along  the <
line 6974=>  don't  know what  I  should  have done with  it when  I got <
line 6975=>home. I am sure it is better in your hands." <
line 6976=>re it is better in your hands." d only  take  two  small chests, one  filled with  silver, and  the <
line 6977=>e strong pony could carry. "That will be quite as much <
line 6978=> manage," said he. <
line 6979=>At last the time came for him to say good-bye to his friends. "Farewell, Balin!" <
line 6980=>  Dwalin;  and  farewell  Dori,  Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  Gloin,  Bifur, <
line 6981=><
line 6982=>####-Bofur, your beards never grow  thin!" And  turning  towards  the <
line 6983=>Mountain  he added: "Farewell Thorin Oakenshield! And Fili and Kili! May your <
line 6984=>Then  the  dwarves  bowed  low  before  their  Gate,  but  words  stuck  in  their <
line 6985=>ood-bye and good luck, wherever you fare!" said Balin at last. "If ever <
line 6986=> when  our  halls  are  made  fair  once  more,  then  the  feast  shall <
line 6987=>"If  ever  you  are  passing my way,"  said Bilbo,  "don't wait  to  knock!  Tea  is  at <
line 6988=>four; but any of you are welcome at any time!" <
line 6989=>any of you are welcome at any time!" <
line 6990=>ny of you are welcome at any time!" rch;.  and  if  it  was  sadly  lessened,  yet  many  were <
line 6991=>glad,  for  now  the  northern  world  would  be  merrier  for  many  a  long  day.  The <
line 6992=>dragon  was  dead,  and  the  goblins  overthrown,  and  their  hearts  looked  forward <
line 6993=>0 a  spring  of  joy. Gandalf  and Bilbo  rode behind the Elvenking, and <
line 6994=>rn, once again  in man's shape, and he  laughed and sang  in <
line 6995=>a loud voice upon the road. So they went on until they drew near to the borders of <
line 6996=>Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out. <
line 6997=>Then  they  halted,  for  the  wizard  and  Bilbo  would  not  enter  the  wood,  even <
line 6998=>though the king bade them stay a while in his halls. They intended to go along the <
line 6999=>und  its northern end  in  the waste  that  lay between  it and <
line 7000=>the  beginning  of  the  Grey Mountains.  It  was  a  long  and  cheerless  road,  but  now <
line 7001=>at  the goblins were crushed,  it seemed safer  to  them  than  the dreadful pathways <
line 7002=>under the trees. Moreover Beorn was going that way too. <
line 7003=>lvenking!"  said  Gandalf.  "Merry  be  the  greenwood, while  the <
line 7004=>y be all your folk!" <
line 7005=>"Farewell!  O  Gandalf!"  said  the  king.  "May  you  ever  appear  where  you  are <
line 7006=>east  expected!  The  oftener  you  appear  in  my  halls  the  better <
line 7007=> beg of  you," said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, "to accept this <
line 7008=>ought out a necklace of  silver and pearls  that Dain had given him <
line 7009=>at their pa way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?" said the king. <
line 7010=>"Well,  er,  I  thought,  don't  you  know,"  said  Bilbo  rather  confused,  "that,  er, <
line 7011=>some  little  return  should  be made  for  your,  er,  hospitality.  I mean  even  a  burglar <
line 7012=>has his feelings. I have drunk much of your wine and eaten much of your bread." <
line 7013=>0gift, O Bilbo  the Magnificent!" said the king gravely. "And I <
line 7014=>name  you  elf-friend  and  blessed. May  your  shadow  never  grow  less  (or  stealing <
line 7015=>would be too easy)! Farewell!" <
line 7016=>Then  the  elves  turned  towards  the  Forest,  and  Bilbo  started  on  his  long  road <
line 7017=>ad many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still <
line 7018=>e many other things in it in those days besides goblins; but <
line 7019=>he  was  well  guided  and  well  guarded-the  wizard  was  with  him,  and  Beorn  for <
line 7020=>much  of  the way-and  he was  never  in  great danger again. Anyway by mid-winter <

line 7023=>men  came  from  far  and  wide  to  feast  at  Beorn's <

line 7033=>Gandalf  took  their  leave  at  last  of Beorn,  and  though  he  longed  for  home. Bilbo <
line 7034=>left with regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were m springtime no less <

line 7037=>  looking  backward  they  saw  a  white  sun  shining  over <
line 7038=>the  out-stretched  lands.  There  behind  lay  Mirkwood,  blue  in  the  distance,  and <

line 7041=>gleaming pale. <
line 7042=>"So  comes  snow  after  fire,  and  even  dragons  have  their  ending!"  said  Bilbo, <
line 7043=>and he  turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish part was getting very tired, <

line 7135=>therefore, he said farewell  to Elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he would <

line 7140=>"There is a long road yet," said Gandalf. <
line 7141=> Gandalf. "But  it  is  the  last  road,"  said  Bilbo.  They  came  to  the  river  that  marked  the <
line 7142=>very  edge  of  the  borderland  of  the Wild,  and  to  the  ford  beneath  the  steep  bank, <
line 7143=>which  you  may  remember.  The  water  was  swollen  both  with  the  melting  of  the <
line 7144=>snows  at  the  approach  of  summer,  and  with  the  daylong  rain;  but  they  crossed <
line 7145=>with some difficulty, and pressed forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of their <

line 7147=>####-journey.  This  was  much  as  it  had  been  before,  except  that  the  company  was <
line 7148=>smaller,  and  more  silent;  also  this  time  there were  no  trolls. At  each  point  on  the <
line 7149=>road Bilbo  recalled  the  happenings  and  the words  of  a  year  ago-it seemed  to him <
line 7150=>of  course,  he  quickly  noted  the  place  where  the  pony  had <

line 7190=>with you! You are not the hobbit that you were." <
line 7191=>And so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came right <
line 7192=>"Bless  me!  What's  going  on?"  he  cried.  There  was  a <
line 7193=>great  commotion,  and  people  of  all  sorts,  respectable  and  unrespectable,  were <
line 7194=>thick  round  the  door,  and many were  going  in  and  out-not even wiping  their  feet <
line 7195=>on the mat, as Bilbo noticed with annoyance. <
line 7196=>th annoyance. f he was surprised,  they were more surprised still. He had arrived back  in  the <
line 7197=> auction! There was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate, <
line 7198=>0the  Twenty-second  Messrs.  Grubb,  Grubb,  and  Bun-owes <
line 7199=>d  sell  by  auction  the  effects  of  the  late  Bilbo  Baggins  Esquire,  of  Bag-End, <
line 7200=>Underhill,  Hobbiton.  Sale  to  commence  at  ten  o'clock  sharp.  It  was  now  nearly <
line 7201=>lunch-time,  and most  of  the  things  had  already  been  sold,  for  various  prices  from <
line 7202=>next  to  nothing  to  old  songs  (as  is  not  unusual  at  auctions).  Bilbo's  cousins  the <
line 7203=>Sackville-Bagginses  were,  in  fact,  busy  measuring  his  rooms  to  see  if  their  own <
line 7204=>furniture would  fit.  In  short Bilbo was  "Presumed Dead,"  and not  everybody  that <
line 7205=>find the presumption wrong. <
line 7206=>The  return  of  Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins  created  quite  a  disturbance,  both  under  the <
line 7207=>Hill  and  over  the Hill, and across  the Water;  it was a great deal more  than a nine <
line 7208=>days' wonder.  The  legal  bother,  indeed,  lasted  for  years.  It was  quite  a  long  time <

line 7212=>silver  spoondisappeared  and were  never  accounted  for.  Personally <
line 7213=>he  suspected  the  Sackville-Bagginses.  On  their  side  they  never  admitted  that  the <
line 7214=>returned  Baggins  was  genuine,  and  they  were  not  on  friendly  terms  with  Bilbo <
line 7215=>ever after. They really had wanted to live in his nice hobbit-hole so very much. <

line 7223=>####-mind.  He  was  quite  content;  and  the  sound  of  the  kettle  on  his  hearth  was  ever <
line 7224=>after more musical  than  it had been  even  in  the quiet days before  the Unexpected <
line 7225=>the mantelpiece. His coat of mail was arranged on <
line 7226=>a  stand  in  the hall  (until he  lent  it  to  a Museum). His gold  and  silver was  largely <
line 7227=>spent in presents, both useful and extravagant â€“ which to a certain extent accounts <
line 7228=>for  the  affection  of  his  nephews  and  his  nieces.  His  magic  ring  he  kept  a  great <
line 7229=>secretfly  used  it  when  unpleasant  callers  came.  He  took  to  writing <
line 7230=>he  elves;  and  though  many  shook  their  heads  and  touched <
line 7231=>Poor  old Baggins!"  and  though  few  believed  any  of  his <
line 7232=>0ales,  he  remained  very  happy  to  the  end  of  his  days,  and  those  were <
line 7233=>extraordinarily long. <
line 7234=>ome  years  afterwards  Bilbo  was  sitting  in  his  study <
line 7235=>ting  his  memoirs  â€“  he  thought  of  calling  them  "There  and  Back  Again,  a <

line 7237=>dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin. <

line 7364=>were, of its end and passing away  before its beginning and middle had  been <

line 7366=>were  already  some  references to the older  matter:  Elrond, Gondolin, the <

line 7368=>things higher or deeper  or darker than its surface: Durin,  Moria, Gandalf, <
line 7369=>g.  The  discovery  of the significance  of  these <
line 7370=>glimpses and of  their relation to  the ancient histories revealed the Third <
line 7371=> War of the Ring. <

line 7377=>increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which  year the tale <

line 7379=>next  five years I  found that the story could  not now be  wholly abandoned,  <
line 7380=>y  by night, till I stood  by Balin's tomb in Moria. <
line 7381=>There I halted for a long while. It  was almost a  year later when I went on <

line 7393=>five  years before the tale was brought to its present end;  in that  time I <
line 7394=>and my college,  and the days though  less dark <

line 7401=>the many opinions  or guesses that I  have  received or have read concerning <
line 7402=>ning  of  the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a  <
line 7403=>tale-teller  to try  his hand at a  really long  story that would  hold  the <
line 7404=> amuse them, delight  them, and at times maybe excite <
line 7405=>them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own  feelings for what is <
line 7406=>r  many the guide  was inevitably often at fault. <

line 7412=>long tale to please everybody at  all  points, nor to displease everybody at <

line 7426=>from that  point the  story would have developed along essentially  the same <

line 7429=>modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels.  <

line 7435=>would m the confusion  and treacheries of the  time have found in Mordor the <

line 7555=>and Hobbits are not mentioned at  all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits  had, in <
line 7556=>le-earth for  many  long years before other folk  <

line 7573=>their peculiar words  and customs, that like many other  folk Hobbits had in <
line 7574=>tward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time <
line 7575=>when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of <
line 7576=>Greenwood <
line 7577=>tains. Why they  later undertook  the hard  and <
line 7578=>ng of the mountains into Eriador is no longer  certain. Their <
line 7579=>own  accounts speak  of the multiplying of Men in  the land, and of a shadow <

line 7585=>n, smaller,  and  shorter, and ess and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble;  <
line 7586=>and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier  <
line 7587=>et  and hands were larger,  and they preferred flat  lands <
line 7588=>and riversides.  The Fallohides  were fairer of  skin and also of  hair, and <

line 7600=>southwards;  and  there  many of  them  long dwelt <
line 7601=>between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again. <
line 7602=>     The  Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were <
line 7603=>Elves  than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in <
line 7604=>language  and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to <
line 7605=> the mountains north of Rivendell  and came  down the  <
line 7606=>River Hoarwell. In  Eriador they soon  mingled with the other kinds that had <
line 7607=>somewhat  bolder  and more adventurous, they  were <

line 7613=>of the DÂ®nedain, the kings of Men that  came over the  Sea  <
line 7614=>out of  Westernesse; but  they were  dwindling fast and  the  lands of their <

line 7672=>obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo's time <
line 7673=> history. The last battle, before this story opens, and <
line 7674=>indeed the  only  one  that had ever been  fought  within the borders of the <
line 7675=>0 memory: the Battle  of  Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in  <

line 7682=>Michel Delving. The  Mathom-house it was  called; for  anything that Hobbits <
line 7683=> for, but were unwilling to throw away,  they  called a  <

line 7690=>ay that astonished those who did not know them  well <
line 7691=>and  looked  no further than their bellies and their well-fed  faces. Though <
line 7692=>rt killing nothing that lived, they were doughty <

line 7698=>believed,  and in such dwellings they still  felt most at  home; but  in  the <
line 7699=>en obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually <
line 7700=>in  the Shire in Bilbo's  days it  was, as a rule, only the richest and  the <
line 7701=>ed the old custom. The poorest  went on  living <
line 7702=>the  most  primitive  kind,  mere holes indeed, with only one <
line 7703=>window or  none;  while  the  well-to-do  still constructed  more  luxurious <
line 7704=>ple diggings of old.  But suitable  sites for these large <
line 7705=>and ramifying tunnels (or smials as they called them) were not everywhere to <
line 7706=>ats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as  they <
line 7707=><
line 7708=>####-multiplied, began to  build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly  regions <
line 7709=>s, such  as  Hobbiton or Tuckborough,  or in the  chief <
line 7710=>township of the Shire, Michel Delving  on  the White Downs, there  were  now <
line 7711=>0ick, or stone. These  were  specially  favoured  by <
line 7712=>millers, smiths, ropers,  and cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even <

line 7717=>re rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore <
line 7718=>muddy  weather. But they were well known  to  be Stoors in  a <
line 7719=>large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on <
line 7720=> foot  or Fallohide had  any trace of a beard. Indeed, the <
line 7721=>folk  of  the Marish,  and  of Buckland,  east  of  the  River,  which  they <
line 7722=>came for the most  part  later into the Shire  up from <
line 7723=>south-away;  and  they still had many peculiar names and strange  words  not <
line 7724=>re. <
line 7725=>e craft of building, as many other crafts beside, <
line 7726=>was derived from the DÂ®nedain. But  the Hobbits  may  have learned it direct <

line 7728=>  youth. For the Elves of  the  not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that <
line 7729=>time at  the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other  places within reach <

line 7731=>the  Tower Hills  beyond the  western marches.  They shone far  off  in  the <

line 7733=>The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop  <
line 7734=>bit had ever  been known to climb it. Indeed, few <
line 7735=>Hobbits  had ever  seen or  sailed  upon the Sea, and fewer  still had  ever  <
line 7736=>Hobbits regarded even  rivers  and small boats <
line 7737=> even  rivers  and small boats ings, and not  many of  them could swim.  And as the days of <
line 7738=>the Shire lengthened  they  spoke  less and  less with  the  Elves, and grew <
line 7739=> distrustful of those  that  had dealings with them; and <
line 7740=>the Sea  became  a word  of fear  among them, and a token of death, and they <
line 7741=>from the hills in the west. <
line 7742=>     The craft  of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits <
line 7743=> fashion. They did not go in  for  towers. Their houses <
line 7744=>were usually long, low,  and comfortable. The oldest kind  were,  indeed, no <
line 7745=>0tations of smials, thatched with dry  grass or  straw, or  <
line 7746=>roofed with turves,  and having walls somewhat  bulged. That stage, however, <
line 7747=>days of the Shire, and hobbit-building had long  since <
line 7748=>been  altered, improved by devices,  learned from Dwarves,  or discovered by <
line 7749=> for round windows, and even round  doors, was the <
line 7750=>chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit -architecture. <
line 7751=>the  holes   of  Shire-hobbits  were  often  large, and <
line 7752=>inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very <
line 7753=>0e also in many other ways, such as their friendship <
line 7754=>with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case  of the Tooks of Great Smials, or  <
line 7755=>Hall,  many  generations of  relatives  lived in <
line 7756=>(comparative) peace  together  in one ancestral  and many -tunnelled mansion. <

line 7761=>a  family-tree  that included  even the more  important members of the  more <

line 7763=>trees  at  the  end  of  the  Red Book of  Westmarch  are  a  small book  in <

line 7772=>pipe-weed or leaf, a variety  probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery <
line 7773=>surrounds the  origin  of this peculiar  custom,  or  'art' as  the  Hobbits <
line 7774=>it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was <
line 7775=>put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since he <

line 7902=> the light, and on an island  of rock  in the water lived <
line 7903=>Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his <
line 7904=>ing with pale luminous eyes  and  catching blind fish <
line 7905=>with his long fingers, and eating  them raw.  He ate  any living thing, even <
line 7906=>and strangle it without a struggle. He possessed a  <
line 7907=>secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago,  when he  still lived in <
line 7908=>hat made its  wearer invisible. It was the  one <
line 7909=>, his 'precious', and he talked to  it, even when it  was not <
line 7910=>with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island, except when he <

line 7912=>     Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him <
line 7913=>it was  not, and  the hobbit held  in his hand an Elvish <
line 7914=>knife,  which served him as a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo <
line 7915=>ing that if he  asked a riddle which Bilbo could not <
line 7916=><
line 7917=>####-guess, then  he would kill him and eat him;  but if Bilbo defeated him, then <

line 7923=>upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten:  What  haw I got in my pocket? <

line 7934=>island, of which Bilbo knew nothing,  not far off in the dark  water. There, <

line 7938=>screech  sent a shiver down Bilbo's back, though he  did not  yet understand <
line 7939=> Gollum had at last leaped to a guess, too late. What <
line 7940=>has  it got  in its pocketses? he  cried. The light in his eyes  was like  a  <
line 7941=>k to murder the hobbit and recover his 'precious'.  <
line 7942=>Just  in  time Bilbo saw his peril,  and he fled blindly up the passage away <
line 7943=>e he was saved by his luck. For  just as he ran <
line 7944=>and in his  pocket, and  the ring  slipped  quietly on to his <
line 7945=>finger. So it was that  Gollum passed him  without seeing him, and  went  to  <
line 7946=>t, lest the 'thief' should escape.  Warily Bilbo  followed <
line 7947=>him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself about his 'precious';  <
line 7948=>ast even Bilbo guessed the truth,  and hope came to him <
line 7949=>in the darkness: he himself had  found the marvellous  ring and a chance  of <

line 7957=>wretched creature at a disadvantage. In  the  end, gathering his courage, he <

line 7961=>it to his companions.  To  them his account was  that Gollum had promised to <

line 7963=>from his island he found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been <

line 8919=>appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the  <
line 8920=> very noticeable. Indeed, he at once  began to  <

line 8922=>the next  year  he gave a party  in  honour of  Bilbo's  hundred-and-twelfth <
line 8923=> called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was  short  of the <
line 8924=>mark, for twenty guests were invited  and  there were several meals at which  <
line 8925=>ned drink, as hobbits say. <
line 8926=>     Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving <
line 8927=>y year after year  until  they got used to it. He said <
line 8928=>that he did not think Bilbo  was dead. When  they asked: 'Where is he then?' <

line 8932=>who  had  as children been fond of  Bilbo  and often in and out of Bag  End.  <
line 8933=>edegar  Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends <
line 8934=>were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin),  and Merry Brandybuck  (his real <
line 8935=> that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping <
line 8936=>all <
line 8937=>over  the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the <
line 8938=>k he was sometimes  seen far  from home walking in <

line 8949=>quite  happy and did not  worry much about the  future. But half unknown  to <

line 8961=>borders.  He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and <
line 8962=>riends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking <
line 8963=>and talking with the strange  wayfarers that began at this time to appear in <

line 8968=>rning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and  were  no  <
line 8969=>longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road <
line 8970=> ancient East -West Road ran through the Shire to its <
line 8971=>end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their <
line 8972=>. They  were the  hobbits' chief  source of  news <
line 8973=>from distant parts  - if they  wanted any: as a rule  dwarves said little and <
line 8974=> now Frodo  often met strange dwarves  of  far  <
line 8975=>ing refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in <
line 8976=><

line 8978=>     That name  the hobbits  only knew in legends  of the  dark past, like a  <
line 8979=>d  of their  memories;  but  it  was  ominous  and <
line 8980=>disquieting. It seemed that the  evil power in Mirkwood had been  driven out <

line 8984=>  growing  fear.  Orcs were  multiplying  again  in  the  <
line 8985=>mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but  cunning and armed <
line 8986=>.  And there  were  murmured  hints of creatures more <

line 8988=>e than all these, but they had no name.  of  course, reached the ears of  ordinary hobbits. <
line 8989=>But  even the deafest  and most stay-at-home began to hear queer  tales; and <

line 9000=>     'No doubt you can,' retorted Sam, 'and I daresay  there's more truth in <

line 9004=>Dragon in Bywater, and that's Green,' he said, getting a general laugh. <
line 9005=>     'All  right,' said  Sam, laughing with the rest. 'But  what about these <
line 9006=>ants, as you might call  them? They do say that one bigger <
line 9007=>than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.' <

line 9035=>or any one else in the Shire.' ' said Sam  thoughtfully. He believed he  had  once <
line 9036=>seen an Elf in the  woods, and still hoped to  see more one  day. Of all the <
line 9037=> his  early  years such fragments of tales  and <
line 9038=>  stories  about  the Elves as the hobbits knew,  had  always <
line 9039=>moved him  most deeply. 'There  are some,  even in these parts, as  know the <
line 9040=>ews  of them,'  he said. 'There's Mr. Baggins now, that I <
line 9041=>work for. He told me  that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves.  <
line 9042=> more:  many's the  talk I had with  him  when I was a  <

line 9047=>drained his mug and  went out noisily. <

line 9052=>and went out. <
line 9053=>l and the sky was now clearing after  heavy rain. The <
line 9054=>sun was down,  and  a cool  pale evening was quietly fading  into night.  He <

line 9065=>had seen or heard of him, and  he had begun  to think that  the wizard would <
line 9066=>p all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as <
line 9067=> home  and twilight was fading, there came the once  familiar <
line 9068=>tap on the study window.  <
line 9069=>     Frodo welcomed  his old friend with  surprise  and great delight.  They <
line 9070=>er. <
line 9071=>dalf. 'You look the same as ever, Frodo!' <
line 9072=>look the same as ever, Frodo!' do replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked <
line 9073=>older and  more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide <
line 9074=>0e  deep in talk, and  they stayed  up far into  the <
line 9075=>night. <
line 9076=>     Next morning after a late breakfast, the  wizard was sitting with Frodo <
line 9077=>f the  study. A bright fire was on the hearth,  but the <
line 9078=>sun was warm, and  the  wind was in the  South. Everything looked fresh, and <
line 9079=>0was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the  <
line 9080=>trees' fingers.  <
line 9081=>ng of  a  spring,  nearly  eighty years before, when <
line 9082=>Bilbo  had run out  of Bag End without  a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps <
line 9083=>been  then,  and his  beard  and eyebrows were perhaps <
line 9084=>longer, and  his face more lined with care and  wisdom; but his eyes were as <
line 9085=>ked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour  and <
line 9086=>delight. <
line 9087=>     He was  smoking  now in  silence, for  Frodo was sitting still, deep in <
line 9088=> light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings <
line 9089=>that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence. <
line 9090=>     'Last  night  you  began to  tell  me  strange  things  about  my ring, <
line 9091=>u stopped, because you said that such matters <
line 9092=>use you said that such matters til  daylight. Don't you think  you  had better finish now?  <
line 9093=>You  say the ring  is dangerous,  far mor e  dangerous than  I guess. In what <
line 9094=>y  ways,' answered  the wizard. It is far  more powerful than  I <
line 9095=>so powerful that in the  end it  would utterly <
line 9096=> in the  end it  would utterly of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him. <
line 9097=>     'In Eregion long  ago many Elven-rings  were made,  magic  rings as you  <
line 9098=>0 of course, of various  kinds: some more potent and <
line 9099=>some  less.  The lesser rings were only essays  in the craft before  it  was <
line 9100=>smiths they were but  trifles  - yet still to my <
line 9101=>mind dangerous for mortals. But  the Great Rings,  the Rings of Power,  they <
line 9102=>were perilous.  <
line 9103=>, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great  Rings, does not die, but <
line 9104=>he does not  grow  or obtain more life, he merely continues, until  at  last <
line 9105=>eariness. And if he often  uses the Ring  to make himself <
line 9106=>invisible,  he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks <
line 9107=>he eye of the  dark power that rules the Rings.  Yes, <
line 9108=>sooner or  later  - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but <
line 9109=>purpose will last  - sooner or later the dark power  <
line 9110=>will devour him.' <
line 9111=>said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound <
line 9112=>of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden. <
line 9113=>ave you  known this?'  asked Frodo  at length. 'And how much <
line 9114=>did Bilbo know?' <
line 9115=> no  more than he told you, I  am  sure,' said Gandalf.  'He <
line 9116=>would certainly never have  passed on  to you anything that he thought would <
line 9117=>ough I  promised to  look after you. He thought the ring  <
line 9118=>was very beautiful, and very  useful at  need;  and if anything was wrong or <

line 9120=>always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to <

line 9124=>inger where it had been tight.'  me of that in his last letter,' said Frodo,  'so I have <
line 9125=>always kept it on its chain.' <
line 9126=>     'Very wise,'  said Gandalf.  'But  as for  his long life,   Bilbo  never  <
line 9127=>  ring  at all. He took  all  the credit  for that to <
line 9128=>himself,  and he was very  proud of  it. Though  he was getting restless and <
line 9129=>d  he  said. A  sign  that  the  ring was getting <
line 9130=>control.' <
line 9131=>     'How long have you known all this?' asked Frodo again. <
line 9132=>     'Known?'  said  Gandalf.  'I  have known  much that only the Wise know,  <
line 9133=>n "known about this ring", well,  I still do not know,  <
line 9134=>one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.  <
line 9135=>egin to guess?' he mused, searching back  in memory. <
line 9136=>'Let me see - it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power  <
line 9137=> the Battle of Five  Armies, that Bilbo found his <
line 9138=>ring.  A  shadow  fell on my  heart then, though  I did not know  yet what I <
line 9139=>llum came  by a Great Ring, as plainly it was <
line 9140=> Great Ring, as plainly it was as clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo's strange story <
line 9141=>of how he had "won" it, and I  could not believe it. When I at last  got the <

line 9145=>power  that  set to  work on  its keeper at once.  That was the  first  real <
line 9146=>ot well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were <
line 9147=>better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little <
line 9148=>else that I could  do.  I could not take it  from him without doing  greater  <
line 9149=>0no right to  do so anyway. I could only watch  and wait.  I <
line 9150=>might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held <

line 9152=>     'Maybe  not,' answered Gandalf. 'Hobbits  are, or were,  no concern  of <
line 9153=>the Wise.  He  is the  chief of  my order and the <
line 9154=><

line 9853=>     Just  why  Mr.  Frodo  was selling  his  beautiful hole was  even  more <
line 9854=>. A  few held the theory - supported by the nods and  <
line 9855=>hints  of Mr. Baggins himself  - that Frodo's money was  running out: he  was <
line 9856=>d live in a  quiet way on the proceeds of the sale <
line 9857=>down  in  Buckland  among   his  Brandybuck  relations.  'As  far  from  the <

line 9870=>a little house  at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all  but <
line 9871=>Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision <

line 9873=>eastern borders  of  the Shire, and as he had lived there  in childhood  his <

line 9893=>fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey <

line 10734=>they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired <

line 10736=>which they  were  going.  The banks of  the stream sank,  as it reached  the <

line 10742=>trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here  and there an elm tree or  an <
line 10743=>ash. The ground was fairly level, and  there was little undergrowth; but the <

line 10745=>sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. <

line 10747=>along <
line 10748=>as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through  thick  drifts  of <

line 10759=>of miles. Then the sun gleamed ouds  again and the rain  lessened. It was now past mid-day,  <
line 10760=>and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its <
line 10761=> turning yellow were still thick, and the  ground at  its <
line 10762=>feel  was fairly dry and sheltered. When  they came to make their meal, they <
line 10763=>had  filled their bottles  with  a  clear drink, pale <
line 10764=>golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made  of many flowers, and was <

line 10781=>   'And what do you think that was?' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak <

line 10784=>     'It was not bird or beast,' said Frodo. 'It was a call, or  a signal -- <

line 10793=>before them. They now saw that  they had, in  fact, turned too much  to  the <
line 10794=>flats  they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury <
line 10795=>across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from <

line 10804=>land  became  steadily  more  tame and  well-ordered.  Soon they  came  into  <
line 10805=>ws: there were  hedges  and gates  and dikes for <
line 10806=>drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an  ordinary corner  of <
line 10807=>the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The  line  of  the River grew <

line 10823=>laugh,  'I am  terrified of  him and his dogs. I have avoided  his  farm for  <

line 10836=>house and farm-buildings peeping ou t among the trees ahead. The Maggots, <

line 10841=>lane. <
line 10842=>     Suddenly  as they drew nearer  a terrific baying and barking broke out, <
line 10843=>ard shouting: 'Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!' <
line 10844=>     Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked  on a few paces. The gate <
line 10845=>opened and  three  huge dogs came  pelting  out  into  the  lane, and dashed <
line 10846=>lers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but <
line 10847=>Sam shrank  against the wall, while  two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him <

line 10854=>     The farmer looked at  him closely. 'Well, if it  isn't Master Pippin   - <
line 10855=>say!' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin. <
line 10856=>'It's a long time since I saw you round here. It's lucky for you that I know <
line 10857=>you. I was just going out to  set my dogs  on  any strangers. There are some <
line 10858=>  on today. Of course, we do get queer folk  wandering  in  <
line 10859=>these parts at times. Too near the River,' he said, shaking his  head.  'But <

line 10868=>     It seemed plain that the  farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do <
line 10869=> and  fashion, so they all accepted  the invitation. 'What <
line 10870=>about the dogs?' asked Frodo anxiously. <
line 10871=> the dogs?' asked Frodo anxiously. They  won't harm you - not unless I  tell 'em to. <

line 10874=>     Pippin introduced  the other two to the farmer. 'Mr. Frodo Baggins,' he <
line 10875=>said.  'You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.' At the <
line 10876=>0s the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment <
line 10877=> of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and <
line 10878=>ushrooms had been aroused, and  be  told  to see him   off. But Farmer Maggot took him by  the <
line 10879=> queerer than ever?'  he exclaimed. 'Mr. Baggins is <
line 10880=>it? Come inside! We must have a talk.' <
line 10881=> a talk.'   They went  into the farmer's  kitchen, and sat by  the wide fire-place. <

line 10886=>mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not <

line 10891=>looked <
line 10892=>at them all in turn. <
line 10893=> Peregrin,' he  said,  'where  might you  be coming from, and <

line 10896=>     'Well, no, '  answered Pippin.  'To tell  you the truth, since  you have <
line 10897=>nto the lane from the other end: we had come  over your  <
line 10898=>fields. But that was quite by accident.  We  lost our way in the woods, back  <

line 10901=>the farmer. 'But I wasn't worrying about  that. You have  leave to walk over  <
line 10902=>r.  Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins  - though I <
line 10903=>d you, Mr. Baggins  - though I ill like mushrooms.'  He laughed.  'Ah yes, I recognized the <
line 10904=>name.  I recollect  the time when young Frodo  Baggins  was one of the worst  <
line 10905=>ckland. But it  wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of. I had <
line 10906=>just heard the name Baggins before  you  turned up.  What do you think  that <
line 10907=>?' <
line 10908=>for  him to go on. 'Well,' the farmer continued, <
line 10909=>approaching his point with slow relish, 'he came riding on a big black horse <
line 10910=>in at  the  gate, which  happened  to be open, and right up to my door.  All <

line 10918=> a  yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail <
line 10919=>and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still. <
line 10920=>     ' "I come  from yonder," he  said,  slow  and stiff-like, pointing back  <
line 10921=>please.  "Have you seen Baggins?" he asked in a  <
line 10922=>queer voice,  and bent  down towards  me. I could not see any face,  for his <

line 10951=>to come back to Buckland. My  advice is: stay  there! And don't get mixed up <
line 10952=> You'll have  friends  in these parts. If any of <
line 10953=>these black  fellows come after you  again,  I'll  deal with  them. I'll say <

line 10955=>s like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.' <
line 10956=>     'Maybe you're right,' said Frodo, avoiding the farmer's eye and staring <

line 10966=>you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh <
line 10967=>to hear it. It's a pity: for I've missed a good friend. And now I'm sorry to <

line 11141=>  At last  they  came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be <

line 11147=>Brandybucks, for the use  of guests, or members of the family that wished to <
line 11148=>escape  from  the  crowded  life  of  Brandy  Hall  for a  time.  It  was an <
line 11149=>ntrified house, as much like a hobbit -hole as possible: it <
line 11150=>was long and low,  with no  upper storey; and it had a roof  of  turf, round <
line 11151=>round door. <
line 11152=> lip the green path  from  the gate no light was visible; <
line 11153=>the  windows  were dark and shuttered.  Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty <

line 11155=>shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on <

line 11157=>house. <
line 11158=>     'Well, what do you think of it?' asked Merry coming up the passage. 'We <

line 11160=>Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.' <
line 11161=>     Frodo looked  round.  It did  look like home. Many of his own favourite <

line 11163=>selling) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been  at Bag End. <

line 11175=>     'A bath!' cried Pippin. 'O blessed Meriadoc!' <

line 11402=>     'The answer to the  second question,' said Merry, 'is that we could get <

line 11469=>he fell into a  vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking  out of a high <
line 11470=>a of tangled trees.  Down below among the roots there <
line 11471=>was the sound of creatures  crawling and snuffling.  He felt sure they would  <
line 11472=>ter. <
line 11473=>e in the distance.  At first he thought  it  was a  <
line 11474=>great wind  coming over the leaves of the forest. Then  he knew  that it was <
line 11475=>the  Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in <
line 11476=>ough it  had often  troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he <
line 11477=>was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on  a dark heath, <
line 11478=>ange salt smell in  the air. Looking up he saw before him <
line 11479=>a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over  <
line 11480=> and see the Sea. He started to struggle  up the ridge <
line 11481=>towards the  tower:  but  suddenly a light came in  the sky, and there was a  <
line 11482=>0###-<h4>Chapter 6.</h4> <br> The Old Forest <
line 11483=>ter 6.</h4> <br> The Old Forest e suddenly. It was still dark in  the room. Merry was standing <
line 11484=>there with a candle  in one hand, and banging  on the  door with the  other. <
line 11485=>s it?' said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered. <
line 11486=>t!' cried Merry. 'It is  time to get up. It is half past four <
line 11487=>and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin <
line 11488=>ing to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be <
line 11489=>the  baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up  and  <
line 11490=>n after  six o'clock the  five  hobbits were  ready  to start. Fatty <
line 11491=>They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in <

line 11493=>nd then  cut across several fields. The leaves <
line 11494=>oss several fields. The leaves glistening, and every twig  was dripping; the grass was grey <
line 11495=>with  cold dew. Everything was  still,  and far-away  noises seemed near and <

line 11498=>the ponies;  sturdy  little beasts of the kind <
line 11499=>rdy  little beasts of the kind , not speedy, but good for  a long day's work. They mounted, <
line 11500=>and  soon  they  were  riding off  into  the  mist,  which  seemed  to  open <
line 11501=>hem and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for  <
line 11502=>about  an  hour,  slowly  and without talking,  they  saw  the Hedge looming  <
line 11503=> tall and netted over  with silver cobwebs.  'How  are <
line 11504=>you  going to get  through  this?'  asked Fredegar. 'Follow me!' said Merry, <
line 11505=>ned to the  left  along  the Hedge, and  soon they <
line 11506=>came to a point  wher e it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A <
line 11507=>ome distance from the  Hedge, and  went sloping <
line 11508=>o the ground. It had walls of brick at  the sides, which rose <
line 11509=>steadily,  until suddenly  they arched  over a nd formed a  tunnel that dived <
line 11510=>ge and came out in the hollow on the other side. <
line 11511=>     Here Fatty Bolger halted. 'Good-bye, Frodo!' he  said.  'I wish you were <

line 11517=>rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar's sight into the tunnel. <
line 11518=>mp. At the far  end it  was  closed  by  a gate of <
line 11519=>thick -set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had <
line 11520=>it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock  <
line 11521=>clicked. The sound was ominous. <
line 11522=>was ominous.  said Merry. 'You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and <
line 11523=> <
line 11524=> true?' asked Pippin. <
line 11525=>     'I don't know what  stories you mean,' Merry answered. 'If you mean the <
line 11526=>urses  used to tell him, about goblins and wolves <
line 11527=>and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I  don't believe them. <

line 11536=>to each  other,  passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; <
line 11537=>oped without any wind. They  do  say the trees <
line 11538=> wind. They  do  say the trees e, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In  fact long  <
line 11539=>ago they  attacked the Hedge: they came and  planted themselves right by it,  <
line 11540=>. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and <
line 11541=>made a great  bonfire in the  Forest, and  burned all the  ground in  a long <
line 11542=>e. After that the  trees gave up the attack,  but they <
line 11543=>became very unfriendly.  There  is  still a wide  bare  space not far inside <

line 11633=>fully, and if  he felt any great anxiety, he did not show <
line 11634=>it. The  others did not  answer.  They were depressed.  A heavy  weight  was <
line 11635=>Frodo's  heart, and he regretted now with every  step <
line 11636=>forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace  of the trees. He <

line 11638=>possible), when  things took  a  new  turn. The  path  stopped climbing, and <
line 11639=>l. The dark trees drew aside, and  ahead they <
line 11640=>es drew aside, and  ahead they th  going  almost  straight forward.  Before them, but some <
line 11641=>distance off, there stood a  green  hill-top, treeless, rising  like a  bald <
line 11642=>rcling wood. The  path seemed to be making directly for  <
line 11643=>it. <
line 11644=>     They now hurried forward again,  delighted with the thought of climbing <
line 11645=>above the roof  of the Forest. The path dipped, and  then <
line 11646=>again began  to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep <
line 11647=>ft the trees and faded into the turf.  The wood stood <
line 11648=>all round the hill like  thick  hair that ended sharply in  a circle round a  <
line 11649=>bbits  led their  ponies up, winding  round and  round until they <
line 11650=>tood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming <
line 11651=> hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near  at <
line 11652=>hand the mist was now almost gone;  though here and there it lay  in hollows <
line 11653=>  the south  of  them, out of a deep  fold cutting  right <
line 11654=>across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke. <
line 11655=>pointing  with his hand, 'that  is the line of the <
line 11656=>Withywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west through <
line 11657=>the <

line 11660=>whole wood  - the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.' <
line 11661=>looked in the  direction  that  Merry  pointed out, but they <
line 11662=>could see little but mists over the damp and  deep-cut valley; and beyond it <
line 11663=> the Forest faded from view.  <
line 11664=>     The sun on the hill-lop was now  getting  hot. It must  have been a bout <
line 11665=>t the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in <
line 11666=>other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the <
line 11667=> of  the Brandywine  beyond  it. Northward, where they <
line 11668=>looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of  the <
line 11669=> they were making. They were on an island in a sea  <
line 11670=>of trees, and the horizon was veiled. <
line 11671=>s veiled.  On the south-eastern  side  the ground fell very  steeply,  as  if  the <
line 11672=>  were  continued  far  down  under  the  trees,  like <
line 11673=>island-shores that really  are the  sides  of a mountain rising  out of deep <
line 11674=>een edge and looked out over the woods below them, <
line 11675=>while they ate their  mid-day meal. As  the sun rose  and  passed  noon they <
line 11676=>t the grey-green lines  of the Downs  that lay <
line 11677=> lines  of the Downs  that lay Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for  it  was <
line 11678=>good to see a sight of anything beyond the  wood's border s,  though they did  <
line 11679=>at way,  if  they  could help it: the Barrow-downs  had as <
line 11680=>sinister a reputation in hobbit -legend as the Forest itself.  <
line 11681=>     At length they made up their minds  to go on again. The path  that  had <
line 11682=>ll reappeared on  the northward side; but they had not  <
line 11683=>followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the <
line 11684=>0o descend  rapidly and they  guessed  that  it must <
line 11685=>actually be heading towards the Withywindle va lley: not at all the direction <
line 11686=>r some  discussion  they decided to  leave  this <
line 11687=>misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to <
line 11688=>see it  from the hill-top, the Road  must lie that way, and it  could not be <
line 11689=>so northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed  <
line 11690=>lo  be drier  and more  open,  climbing up to slopes  where  the  trees were <
line 11691=>nd firs replaced the oaks and ashes  and other  strange <
line 11692=>and nameless trees  of the denser wood. <
line 11693=>d nameless trees  of the denser wood. seemed  to  be good: they got along  at a fair <
line 11694=>enever they got  a glimpse of the sun  in an open glade they <
line 11695=>seemed  unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But  after a time the  trees <
line 11696=>ain,  just where they had appeared from a distance to be <
line 11697=>thinner and  less tangled. Then  deep  folds  in  the ground were discovered <
line 11698=> the ruts of great  giant-wheels or  wide moats and sunken <
line 11699=>roads long disused and choked with  brambles. These lay usually right across <
line 11700=> and could only be crossed  by scrambling down and out <
line 11701=>again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they <
line 11702=>e  hollow  filled  with  thick bushes  and  matted <
line 11703=>undergrowth, which somehow would not  yield to the  left, but only  gave way <
line 11704=> and they  had to go some  distance along  the <
line 11705=>o go some  distance along  the ey could find a  way up  the  further bank.  Each  time they <
line 11706=>clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and  darker;  and always  to the left <
line 11707=>ost difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the  <
line 11708=>right and downwards.  <
line 11709=>     After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though <
line 11710=>they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They <
line 11711=>off,  and were simply following a course chosen for them - <
line 11712=>eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it. <
line 11713=>0aring away when they scrambled and stumbled  into a  <
line 11714=>fold that was  wider and  deeper than any they had yet met. It  was so sleep <
line 11715=>d  impossible  to climb out  of it again, either  <
line 11716=>forwards  or  backwards, without  leaving  their ponies  and  their  baggage <
line 11717=> to  follow  the fold - downwards. The ground <
line 11718=>e fold - downwards. The ground  places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they  <
line 11719=>found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy <
line 11720=> began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and <
line 11721=>noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully <
line 11722=>gh above them. <
line 11723=>ëling along for some way along  the  stream, they came  quite <
line 11724=>suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before <
line 11725=>e opening they found  that they had  made their way down <
line 11726=>through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide <
line 11727=>; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank  <
line 11728=>almost as  steep. A golden  afternoon  of  late sunshine lay warm and drowsy <
line 11729=>en. In the midst of it there wound lazily a  dark <
line 11730=>river  of brown  water,  bordered with ancient  willows,  arched  over  with <
line 11731=>illows,  and flecked with thousands  of faded <
line 11732=>ecked with thousands  of faded he  air was thick  with  them, fluttering  yellow from  the <
line 11733=>branches;  for there  was a  warm  and gentle breeze blowing  softly   in the  <
line 11734=>ds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking. <
line 11735=><
line 11736=>####-     'Well, now I have at  least some  notion  of where we are!' said Merry. <
line 11737=> in the opposite direction to which we intended. This is <
line 11738=>the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore.' <
line 11739=>into the sunshine and disappeared into the  long grasses.  <
line 11740=>After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground <
line 11741=> and the river; in  some places firm turf went down to <
line 11742=>the water's edge. 'What's more,' he  said, 'there seems to be something like <
line 11743=> on  this side  of the river. If  we turn left and <
line 11744=>follow it, we  shall be bound to  come out on the  east side of  the  Forest <
line 11745=>!' said Pippin. 'That  is, if the  track goes on so far, and <
line 11746=>does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there.  Who made  the track, <
line 11747=>why?  I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting  <
line 11748=>very suspicious  of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe <
line 11749=>it. And have you any idea how far eastward we  should  <
line 11750=>have to go?' <
line 11751=> haven't. I don't  know in the  least how far down <
line 11752=>the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to <
line 11753=>make <
line 11754=> no other way out that I can see or think of.' <
line 11755=>t that I can see or think of.'  nothing  else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to <
line 11756=>the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and  grasses were lush <
line 11757=>far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy <
line 11758=>to  follow, as it  turned  and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among <
line 11759=> and there it passed  over other rills, running down <
line 11760=>gullies into the Wi thywindle  out of the higher  forest -lands,  and at these <
line 11761=>nks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across.  <
line 11762=>     The  hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies  of all <
line 11763=>rs, and the afternoon sun was burning  on their <
line 11764=> they  came suddenly into a thin shade;  great grey  branches <
line 11765=>reached across  the  path. Each step forward became more  reluctant than the <
line 11766=>emed to be creeping out of the ground and up their  legs, <
line 11767=>and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes. <
line 11768=>     Frodo  felt his  chin go down and  his head nod. Just in front  of  him <
line 11769=>0 his knees.  Frodo halted. 'It's no good,' he heard <
line 11770=>Merry saying. 'Can't go another step  without rest. Must have nap. It's cool <
line 11771=>!' <
line 11772=>e the sound of this. 'Come  on!' he  cried. 'We  can't  <
line 11773=>have a  nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.' But the others were <
line 11774=>0i de them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly.  <
line 11775=>     Suddenly  Frodo  himself  felt  sleep overwhelming him.  His head swam. <
line 11776=>und  in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. <
line 11777=>oise on the edge of hearing,  a soft  fluttering as of a song <
line 11778=>half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes <
line 11779=>er him a  huge willow-tree,  old  and hoary. Enormous  it  <
line 11780=>looked,  its  sprawling  branches  going  up like  reaching  arms with  many <
line 11781=>its knotted and twisted trunk gaping  in wide fissures <
line 11782=>that creaked faintly as the boughs  moved. The leaves fluttering against the <
line 11783=>and he toppled over, lying where  he fell upon the <
line 11784=>grass. <
line 11785=>     Merry and Pippin dragged themselves  forward  and  lay down  with their  <
line 11786=>trunk.  Behind them  the  great  cracks gaped  wide  to <
line 11787=>receive them as the  tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and <
line 11788=>0tly against the light, and singing. They shut their <
line 11789=>eyes, and  then it seemed  that  they  could almost hear words,  cool words,  <
line 11790=> and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell <
line 11791=>and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow. <
line 11792=>or  a while  fighting with  the sleep that was overpowering <
line 11793=>him;  then  with  an  effort  he  struggled  to  his feel again. He  felt  a  <
line 11794=>or cool water.  'Wait for me,  Sam,' he  stammered.  'Must  <
line 11795=>bathe feet a minute.' <
line 11796=>     Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward  side of the tree, <
line 11797=> out into the stream, like  gnarled  dragonets <
line 11798=>ream, like  gnarled  dragonets o drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel <
line 11799=>in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back  <
line 11800=>     Sam sat down and  scratched his head, and yawned like a  cavern. He was <
line 11801=>ernoon  was  getting late,  and  he  thought  this  sudden <
line 11802=>sleepiness  uncanny.  'There's more  behind this than sun and warm air,'  he <
line 11803=> 'I don't like this great big tree. I  don't trust it. <
line 11804=>Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won't do at all!' <
line 11805=>     He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become <
line 11806=>two had wandered on a good way along the path; <
line 11807=> on a good way along the path;  caught them and brought them back towards the others,  when <
line 11808=><
line 11809=>####-he  heard two noises; one loud, and the other  soft but very  clear. One was <
line 11810=>the  splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise <
line 11811=>like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast. <
line 11812=>     He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was  in the water close to the  edge, <
line 11813=>eemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was <
line 11814=>not struggling. Sam gripped him by the  jacket, and dragged him  from  under <
line 11815=>ficulty hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once <
line 11816=>he woke, and coughed and spluttered. <
line 11817=>spluttered. o you know, Sam,' he said at length, 'the beastly tree  threw me in! I <
line 11818=>st twisted round and tipped me in!' <
line 11819=>isted round and tipped me in!' expect, Mr. Frodo,'  said Sam. 'You shouldn't sit <
line 11820=>in such a place, if you feel sleepy.' <
line 11821=>el sleepy.' What  about the  others?' Frodo asked. 'I wonder  what sort of  dr eams <
line 11822=> They went round to the other side of the tree, and  then Sam understood <
line 11823=>heard. Pippin  had vanished. The crack by which he had <
line 11824=>laid himself had closed together, so that  not  a chink could be seen. Merry <
line 11825=> had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, <
line 11826=>but the  rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of  which  gripped <
line 11827=> Frodo and  Sam beat  first upon the  tree-trunk where Pippin had  lain. <
line 11828=>antically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held <
line 11829=>poor Merry. It was quite useless.  <
line 11830=>less.   'What a  foul thing to happen!' cried Frodo  wildly. 'Why  did  we ever  <
line 11831=>ul  Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow! ' He <
line 11832=>kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless  of  his own  feet. A hardly <
line 11833=>hrough the stem and up into the branches; the leaves <
line 11834=>rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter. <

line 11836=>our luggage, Mr. Frodo?' asked rought a  little hatchet for chopping firewood,' said Frodo. 'That <

line 11838=> with fire!' <
line 11839=>aid Frodo doubtfully. 'We might succeed in roasting Pippin <
line 11840=>alive inside.' <
line 11841=>ight try  to hurt or  frighten  this tree to begin with,' said Sam <
line 11842=>hem go,  I'll  have it down,  if  I have to gnaw <
line 11843=>it.' He  ran to the ponies and before  long  came back with two tinder -boxes <
line 11844=>ey gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits  of bark; and made <
line 11845=>a  pile  of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These  they heaped against  the <
line 11846=>ide of the tree from  the prisoners. As soon  as Sam  had <
line 11847=>struck  a spark into  the tinder,  it kindled the dry grass  and a flurry of <
line 11848=>. The  twigs crackled. Little fingers  of fire licked <
line 11849=>against  the dry scored rind of  the ancient tree and scorched  it. A tremor  <
line 11850=>low. The leaves  seemed to hiss above their  heads <
line 11851=>with a sound of pain and anger. A loud  scream came from Merry, and from far <
line 11852=>pin give a muffled yell. <
line 11853=>     'Put it out! Put it out!' cried Merry. 'He'll squeeze me in two, if you  <
line 11854=>   'Who?  What?' shouted Frodo,  rushing  round  to  the other side of the <
line 11855=> out! Put it  out!'  begged Merry.  The  branches of the wi llow <
line 11856=> was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading <
line 11857=>of a wind rising and spreading  branches of all the other trees round about, as though they <
line 11858=>had  dropped a stone into the quiet slumber  of the river -valley and  set up <
line 11859=>hat  ran out  over the  whole  Forest. Sam kicked at  the <
line 11860=>little fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of <
line 11861=>he hoped  for, ran  along the path crying help! help! <
line 11862=>help! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill <
line 11863=> from  him by  the willow-wind and drowned  in  a  <
line 11864=>clamour of leaves,  as soon as the  words left his mouth. He felt desperate: <
line 11865=>nly  he  slopped.  There was an answer, or  so  he  thought; but it <
line 11866=>d him, away down  the  path  further back in  the <
line 11867=>Forest.  He turned round and listened, and soon  there  could  be no  doubt: <
line 11868=>deep glad voice  was  singing  carelessly and <
line 11869=>  was  singing  carelessly and as singing nonsense: <
line 11870=>     Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! <
line 11871=>  Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! fal lal the willow! <
line 11872=>     Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! <
line 11873=>mbadillo! ####-     Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both <
line 11874=>stood still. Suddenly  out of  a long string of  nonsense-words (or so  they <
line 11875=>and clear and burst into this song: <
line 11876=>lear and burst into this song: erry dol! My darling! <
line 11877=>     Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling. <
line 11878=>     Down  along under Hill, shining in the sunlight, <

line 11880=>orstep for the cold starlight, River-woman's daughter, <
line 11881=>     Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water. <

line 11884=>     Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o, <
line 11885=>berry, merry yellow berry-o! <

line 11888=>ain water-lilies bringing. <
line 11889=>     Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?  <
line 11890=> Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed  out. The  leaves <
line 11891=>hung silently again on stiff branches. There was  another burst of song, and <
line 11892=>ing and dancing along the path, there  appeared above the <
line 11893=>reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in <
line 11894=>hop and a bound there came into  view a man, or so it <
line 11895=>seemed.  At any rate he wa s  too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not  quite <
line 11896=> Big People, though he made noise enough for  one, <
line 11897=>slumping along with  great yellow  boots on  his  thick legs,  and  charging <
line 11898=>a cow going down to  drink. He had a blue coat <
line 11899=> to  drink. He had a blue coat  beard; his eyes  were blue and bright, and his face was red <
line 11900=>as  a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred  wrinkles of laughter.  In  his <
line 11901=>n a  large  leaf  as  on a tray  a  small pile  of white <
line 11902=>water -lilies.  <
line 11903=>rodo  and  Sam  running  towards  him with their  hands <
line 11904=>stretched out. <

line 11906=>they  stopped  short, as  if  they  had been  struck stiff. 'Now,  my little <
line 11907=>ing to, puffing like a  bellows? What's the matter  <
line 11908=>here  then?  Do  you  know who I am? I'm  Tom Bombadil.  Tell me what's <

line 11911=>w. Don't you crush my lilies!' t in the willow-tree,' cried Frodo breathlessly. <
line 11912=>     'Master Merry's being squeezed in a crack!' cried Sam. <
line 11913=>0ted Tom Bombadil,  leaping up  in the air. 'Old Man Willow? <
line 11914=>Naught  worse than that, eh? That  can soon  be mended. I know the  tune for <
line 11915=>w-man! I'll freeze his  marrow cold, if he don't behave <
line 11916=>himself. I'll  sing his roots off. I'll sing a  wind up  and blow  leaf  and <
line 11917=>0illow!' Setting down his  lilies carefully  on  the <
line 11918=>grass, he  ran to  the tree. There he saw Merry's feet  still sticking out  - <
line 11919=>drawn further inside. Tom  put his mouth to  the <
line 11920=>crack  and  began singing  into it in a  low voice. They could not catch the <
line 11921=>words, but  evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick.  Tom sprang <
line 11922=>g off a hanging branch smote  the side of the  willow with  <
line 11923=>it. 'You  let  them  out  again, Old  Man Willow!'  he  said. 'What  be  you  <
line 11924=> should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! <

line 11937=>d then with a beckoning  wave  of  his hand  went hopping and <

line 11952=>     After that the hobbits heard  no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to <
line 11953=>d them. They thought of the slanting  light  of <
line 11954=>ing on the  Brandywine River, and  the windows  of Bucklebury <
line 11955=>beginning  to gleam with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them; <
line 11956=> of trees hung  dark and threatening over the path. White  <
line 11957=>mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the <
line 11958=>on its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a  <
line 11959=>shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk. <
line 11960=>     It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their <
line 11961=>0ge furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on <
line 11962=>either  side of them; and if  they looked  up  to the pale sky,  they caught <
line 11963=>d knobbly  faces that gloomed dark against  the <
line 11964=>leered down at them  from the high bank and the edges of  the <
line 11965=>wood. They  began to feel that  all this  country was unreal,  and that they <

line 11970=>a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left  <
line 11971=>out from the  Forest, and found a wide sweep  of grass <
line 11972=>welling up before them. The  river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily <

line 11977=>The path was now plain before  them, well-tended and bordered with stone. It <
line 11978=>wound  up on to the top  of a grassy knoll,  now grey under  the pale starry <
line 11979=> still high  above them  on a further slope, they saw  the <
line 11980=>twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up aga in, up <
line 11981=>ide of  turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow <
line 11982=>beam  flowed out  brightly  from a  door  that  was  opened.  There  was Tom <
line 11983=>0 them, up,  down,  under hill. Behind  it  a  steep <
line 11984=>shoulder of the land  lay grey and bare,  and beyond that the dark shapes of <

line 11986=>     They  all hurried  forward,  hobbits  and  ponies. Already  half  their <

line 11993=>0ing  down  into  the night from a bright morning in <

line 12012=>of gold, shaped like a chain  of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue  eyes of <

line 12018=> to bow  low,  feeling  strangely surprised  and <
line 12019=>awkward,  like folk that, knocking at a  cottage door to  beg for a drink of <

line 12026=>ed her back to  it, with her  white arms spread <
line 12027=>. 'Let us  shut out the night!'  she said. 'For you are still <
line 12028=>afraid, per haps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. <
line 12029=>tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.' <

line 12050=>busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender  <
line 12051=>0ment filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere  behind <
line 12052=>the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught,  among <
line 12053=>a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo  the repeated words:  <
line 12054=>     Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;  <
line 12055=>ld Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;  t is, and his boots are yellow.  <
line 12056=> again after  a  while. 'Tell me, if my asking <
line 12057=> while. 'Tell me, if my asking olish, who is Tom Bombadil?' <
line 12058=>     'He is,' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling. <
line 12059=>questioningly.  'He is, as you  have seen him,' she <
line 12060=>said in answer to his look. 'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.' <
line 12061=>     'Then all this strange land belongs to him?' <
line 12062=>     'No indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a <
line 12063=>burden,'  she added  in  a low voice, as if to herself. 'The trees  and  the <
line 12064=>things growing  or  living  in  the  land belong  each  to <
line 12065=>themselves.  Tom  Bombadil is the Master. No  one has ever  caught  old  Tom <
line 12066=>  wading in the  water, leaping on the hill-tops under  <

line 12068=>     A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his <

line 12082=> tangles!'    He  opened the door, and they followed  him  down  a short passage  and  <
line 12083=>rn. They  came  to  a low  room  with a  sloping  roof (a <
line 12084=>penthouse, it  seemed, built on  to  the north end  of the house). Its walls <
line 12085=>ut they were  mostly covered  with green hanging mats <
line 12086=>and  yellow curtains. The  floor  was flagged, and  strewn with  fresh green <
line 12087=>p  mattresses, each  piled  with white  blankets,  <
line 12088=>laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench  <
line 12089=>asins,  and beside it stood  brown ewers filled <

line 12091=>ready beside each bed. <
line 12092=>     Before long, washed and  refreshed,  the  hobbits  were  seated  at the <
line 12093=>hile at e ither end sat Goldberry  and the Master. <
line 12094=>It  was  a long and  merry  meal. Though  the hobbits ate, as only  famished <

line 12096=>in their drinking-bowls seemed  water, yet it went to  their hearts like  wi ne and set free <
line 12097=>their  voices.  The guests  became  suddenly aware  that  they were  singing <
line 12098=>as easier and more natural than talking. <
line 12099=>and more natural than talking.  Goldberry rose and  cleared  the  table  swiftly. The <
line 12100=>guests were  commanded to  sit  quiet,  and were set in chairs,  each with a  <

line 12110=>ed  out  of  the room  with a  ustle. The sound  of her footsteps was like a stream falling <

line 12120=>chance brought  me then,  if  chance  you call it.  It was no  plan of mine, <
line 12121=>  for you.  We heard  news of you,  and learned that you <

line 12123=>  Withywindle. Old grey  Willow-man, he's  a  mighty <
line 12124=>singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape  his cunning mazes.  But Tom <
line 12125=> dared not hinder.' Tom  nodded as if sleep  was <
line 12126=>taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice: <

line 12131=>     Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her, <
line 12132=>     in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle; <

line 12170=>and <
line 12171=>as a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it <

line 12238=>singing  here  and  there  outside.  The  room  looked   westward  over  the <
line 12239=> window was open. Water dripped  down  from the <
line 12240=> above. Before  they had  finished  breakfast the  clouds had <
line 12241=>joined into  an  unbroken roof,  and  a  straight grey rain came softly  and <
line 12242=>nd its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled. <
line 12243=>     As they looked out of  the window there came falling gently as if it was <
line 12244=>of the sky, the clear  voice  of Goldberry singing <
line 12245=>up above them. They could hear  few  words, but it seemed plain to them that <
line 12246=>sweet as  showers on dry hills,  that told the <
line 12247=>s on dry hills,  that told the  from the  spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The <
line 12248=>hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his  heart, and blessed <
line 12249=> because it delayed them from departing. The  thought of <
line 12250=>going had been heavy upon him from  the moment  he awoke; but he guessed <
line 12251=>further that day. <

line 12255=>door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little  river of milk and <
line 12256=>y down into the  valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round <
line 12257=>the <
line 12258=>corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain  - and <

line 12266=>ometimes looking at  them suddenly with a bright blue <
line 12267=>eye  under  his deep brows. Often his voice would turn to song, and he would <
line 12268=>  dance about.  He  told them tales of  bees  and <
line 12269=>flowers,  the ways of trees, and the strange creatures  of the Forest, about <
line 12270=>ngs,  things  friendly and things unfriendly, <
line 12271=>riendly and things unfriendly, kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles. <
line 12272=>istened,  they began to  understand  the lives of the Forest, <
line 12273=>apart from themselves, indeed to  feel themselves as the strangers where all <

line 12275=>Man  Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed  more  <
line 12276=> comfortable lore. Tom's words laid bare the hearts of <
line 12277=>trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with <
line 12278=>o free upon the  earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, <
line 12279=>hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called  the Old Forest  <

line 12281=> it there  lived  yet, ageing no quicker than the hills,  the <
line 12282=>fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The  <

line 12297=>on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young  Sun <
line 12298=> red metal of their  new and greedy swords. There was <
line 12299=>victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went  <
line 12300=>piled on the  biers of dead kings and queens;  and <
line 12301=>mounds covered them, and the stone  doors were shut; and the grass grew over  <
line 12302=>le biting the  grass,  but soon the hills  were <
line 12303=>  shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were <
line 12304=>stirred in  the  mounds.  Barrow-wights walked in  the hollow places  with a  <

line 12306=>grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight. <
line 12307=>     The  hobbits   shuddered.   Even  in  the   Shire  the  rumour  of  the <

line 12309=>was not a tale that  any  hobbit  liked to listen  to, even by a comfortable <
line 12310=>our now  suddenly remembered what the joy of this <
line 12311=>house had  driven from their minds: the  house of Tom Bombadil nestled under <

line 12318=>starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and <
line 12319=>ed  as if he was falling asleep.  The hobbits sat still <
line 12320=>before  him, enchanted; and it  seemed as if, under the  spell of his words, <
line 12321=>0he clouds had  dried  up,  and  the  day  had  been <
line 12322=>withdrawn, and darkness  had  come from  East and West, and all  the sky was <

line 12327=>heavens seemed  to be round  him. He spoke at  last out  of his wonder and a  <

line 12331=>'Don't you know my name yet? That's the only  answer. Tell me,  who are you, <
line 12332=>nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that's <
line 12333=>what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before  the river and the <

line 12337=>westward, Tom was here already, before the  seas were bent. He knew the dark <

line 12354=>caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they  seemed to  weave a single dance, <

line 12356=>he  room, and  round about the reat speed food and vessels and  lights were set  in order. <
line 12357=>The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow.  Tom bowed to his  guests.  <

line 12359=>clothed all in silver with  a white girdle, and her  shoes were like fishes' <
line 12360=> clean blue, blue as rain -washed forget-me-nots, and <

line 12367=>a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in <
line 12368=>mirth and laughter. <
line 12369=>     After they had eaten,  Goldberry  sang many songs for them, songs  that <
line 12370=> and fell softly down into  silence; and in the <
line 12371=>aw in their minds pools and  waters wider  than any  they had <
line 12372=>known, and looking into them they  saw the sky below them and the stars like <
line 12373=>hs. Then  once more she wished them  each  good night and <
line 12374=>left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them <

line 12376=>ll the history  and doings of  the Shire down from  <
line 12377=>days hardly remembered among the hobbits  themselves. It  no longer surprised <
line 12378=> that he owed  his  recent knowledge  largely to <
line 12379=>Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more  importance <
line 12380=>than <
line 12381=>rth under  his  old  feet, and  clay  on  his <
line 12382=> old  feet, and  clay  on  his n his bones, and both  his eyes are open,' said Tom. It was <

line 12396=>end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the <

line 12413=>right, for Merry was staring blankly  at his  chair, and obviously could not <

line 12415=>outer door. <
line 12416=> Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in <

line 12426=>well to start early; for weather in  that  country was  a  <

line 12449=><
line 12450=> <
line 12451=> <
line 12452=>     That night  they heard no noises.  But either in his  dreams or  out of <

line 12454=>mind;  a  song  that  seemed  to  come  like  a  pale  light behind  a  grey <
line 12455=>g stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, <
line 12456=>until at last it was rolled back, and a  far green country opened before him <
line 12457=> The vision  melted  into  waking; and  there  was  Tom whistling like a  <
line 12458=>and the  sun was already  slanting  down the  hill  and <
line 12459=>through the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold. <
line 12460=>     After breakfast, which they  again  ate  alone,  they made ready to say <
line 12461=> heavy of heart as was possible on such  a morning: cool, <
line 12462=>bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh <
line 12463=>heir quiet  ponies were almost  frisky,  sniffing and <
line 12464=>moving  restlessly. Tom came out  of the house and  waved his hat and danced <
line 12465=>the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good  <
line 12466=>speed. <
line 12467=>     They rode off along a path  that  wound away from behind the house, and  <
line 12468=>ards the north  end  of  the hill-brow  under which  it <
line 12469=>sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their  ponies up the last  steep <

line 12471=> cried. 'My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have <
line 12472=>never said  farewell  to her, nor seen  her  since the evening!' He  was  so <
line 12473=>ed  back;  but at  that  moment  a  clear  call  came <
line 12474=>rippling down. There on the  hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair <
line 12475=>t caught the sun it shone and  shimmered. A light <
line 12476=>like the glint  of  water on dewy grass  flashed from under her  feet as she <
line 12477=>the  last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They <
line 12478=>bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they  looked <
line 12479=>r lands under the morning. It was now as clear and  <
line 12480=>far-seen as it  had been veiled and misty  when they stood upon the knoll in <
line 12481=> be seen rising pale and green out of  the dark <
line 12482=>st. In that direction the land rose in  wooded ridges, green, <
line 12483=><
line 12484=>####-yellow,  russet under  the sun, beyond which lay hidden the  valley  of  the <
line 12485=>Brandywine. To the South, over  the  line of  the Withywindle,  there was  a  <
line 12486=>where  the Brandywine River  made a great loop  <
line 12487=>s  and  flowed   away  out of  the  knowledge of the  hobbits.  <
line 12488=>g  downs  the land  ran  away  in  flats  and <
line 12489=>and  ran  away  in  flats  and   and green and pale earth -colours, until it  faded  into a  <
line 12490=>featureless and  shadowy  distance.  Eastward  the Barrow-downs  rose, ridge <
line 12491=>he morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it <
line 12492=>was no more  than a guess of  blue and a remote  white glimmer blending with <
line 12493=>t it spoke to them, out of  memory  and old tales, of <
line 12494=>the high and distant mountains. <
line 12495=>ntains. y  took a deep draught  of  the air, and felt that a skip and  a few <
line 12496=> them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted  <
line 12497=>to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs  towards the Road, <
line 12498=>  as lusty as Tom, over the stepping  stones of <
line 12499=>ght towards the Mountains.  <
line 12500=>     Goldberry spoke  to them  and recalled their eyes and thoughts.  'Speed <
line 12501=>he said. 'And hold to your purpose! North with the wind <
line 12502=>in  the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the  Sun <
line 12503=>0she  said:  'Farewell,  Elf-friend, it was a  merry <
line 12504=>meeting!' <
line 12505=>     But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, <
line 12506=>s friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope  behind  the <
line 12507=>hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view.  <
line 12508=> between the green walls of hillside  and hillside, and <
line 12509=>the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when <

line 12511=>and slender like  a sunlit flower  against the  sky: she  was standing still <

line 12513=>ar  call,  and lifting  up  her hand she turned  and vanished <
line 12514=>behind the hill. <
line 12515=>wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet <
line 12516=>of a steep hill into  another deeper and  broader  valley, and then over the <
line 12517=> hills, and down their long  limbs, and  up  their smooth <
line 12518=>sides again, up on to  new hill -tops and down into new valleys. There was no <
line 12519=>water: it  was a country  of  grass  and short springy <
line 12520=>turf, silent  except for the whisper of the air over the edges  of the land, <
line 12521=>s of  strange birds.  As they journeyed the sun mounted,  <
line 12522=>and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown <
line 12523=>a  glimpse of the country westward the distant  Forest <
line 12524=>seemed to be  smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf <
line 12525=>dow now lay round the edge of  sight, a dark  haze <
line 12526=>above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy. <
line 12527=>     About mid-day  they  came to  a hill whose top  was wide and flattened, <
line 12528=>like a shallow  saucer with a  green mounded rim. Inside  there was  no  air <
line 12529=>stirring,  and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode  across and looked  <
line 12530=>northwards. Then  their hearts rose,  for it seemed plain that they had come <
line 12531=> they had expected. Certainly the distances  had now all <
line 12532=>become hazy and deceptive, but there could  be no doubt that  the Downs were <
line 12533=>coming to  an end. A  long valley  la y below  them winding  away northwards,  <
line 12534=>  came  to  an opening  between two  steep shoulders. Beyond,  there <
line 12535=>ls. Due north  they faintly glimpsed  a  long dark <
line 12536=>line. That is a line  of trees,' said Merry, 'and that must mark  the  Road. <

line 12539=>   'Splendid!'  said Frodo. 'If we make as good going this afternoon as we <
line 12540=>ng, we shall have left  the Downs before the Sun sets and <
line 12541=>be jogging on in search of a camping place.'  But even as he spoke he turned <
line 12542=>nd he saw that on that side the hills were higher and <
line 12543=>looked down  upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green  mounds,  <
line 12544=> stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of <
line 12545=>green gums.  <
line 12546=>quieting; so they  turned  from  the sight and  <
line 12547=> the hollow circle. In  the  midst of it there stood a single <
line 12548=>stone, standing  tall  under  the  sun above,  and at this hour  casting  no <
line 12549=>eless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding <
line 12550=>finger, or more like  a  warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun  was <
line 12551=>oon; so they set their backs against the east side of <
line 12552=>the stone. It was cool,  as if the sun had  had no power to warm  it; but at <
line 12553=>ant. There they took food and drink,  and made as <
line 12554=>good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for  the food came <
line 12555=> provided them with plenty for the comfort of <
line 12556=>with plenty for the comfort of nies unburdened strayed upon the grass.  <
line 12557=>     Rhills,  and eating  their fill, the warm  sun and  the <
line 12558=><
line 12559=>####-scent  of  turf,  lying a little  too long, stretching  out  their legs  and <
line 12560=>bove their noses: these things are,  perhaps,  enough to <
line 12561=>explain  what  happened.  However,  that  may  be:  they  woke  suddenly and <
line 12562=>ep they had never meant  to take. The standing stone <
line 12563=>was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward  over them. <
line 12564=>ellow, was gleaming  through the mist just above <
line 12565=>the  west wall  of the  hollow  in which  they lay; north, south, and  east, <
line 12566=>beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy <
line 12567=>ponies  were standing  crowded together  with their  heads <
line 12568=>down. <
line 12569=>eir feet in alarm,  and ran to the western rim. <
line 12570=> they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out <
line 12571=>in  dismay  towards the setting sun, it sank before their  eyes into a white <
line 12572=>y shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog  rolled up <
line 12573=>to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads <
line 12574=>f: they were shut  in a  hall of  mist  whose central <
line 12575=>pillar was the standing stone. <
line 12576=>     They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but  they did  not quite <
line 12577=>mbered  the hopeful view they had had of the line  <
line 12578=>of the Road ahead,  and they still knew in  which direction it  lay. In  any <
line 12579=>dislike for that hollow place  about the stone <
line 12580=> hollow place  about the stone   of remaining there  was in their minds.  They packed up as <
line 12581=>quickly as their chilled fingers would work. <
line 12582=>heir chilled fingers would work.  leading their ponies  in single file  over the  rim and <
line 12583=>down the long northward slope of  the hill,  down into a foggy sea. As  they <
line 12584=>went down the mist  became colder  and damper, and their hair hung lank  and <
line 12585=>on  their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it  was so  cold  <
line 12586=>out cloaks and  hoods, which soon became  bedewed <
line 12587=>ops. Then, mounting  their ponies,  they went  sl owly on again,  <
line 12588=> and fall of the ground. They were steering, as <
line 12589=>well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end <
line 12590=>0f  the  long valley which  they  had  seen in the  morning.  Once they were <
line 12591=>hey had only lo keep on in  anything like a straight line <
line 12592=>hey were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go <
line 12593=> a vague hope  that  perhaps  away  beyond the  Downs <
line 12594=>there might be no fog. <
line 12595=>0 was  very slow.  To  prevent their  getting separated  and <
line 12596=><
line 12597=>####-wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam <
line 12598=> and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley <
line 12599=>seemed <
line 12600=>to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign.  On  either side <
line 12601=>ahegan  to loom  through  the mist; and he guessed that they <
line 12602=>were  at  last  approaching  the gap in  the hills,  the north-gate  of  the <
line 12603=>could pass that, they would be free. <
line 12604=>pass that, they would be free.  he called back over  his shoulder, and he hurried <
line 12605=>forward.  But  his  hope soon  changed  to bewilderment and alarm. The  dark <
line 12606=>patches  grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous <
line 12607=>eaning  slightly towards one another like the pillars  of  a  <
line 12608=>headless door, two huge  standing  stones. He could not remember having seen <
line 12609=>any sign  of  these in the  valley, when  he looked out from the hill in the <
line 12610=>morning. He had passed  between them almost before he was aware: and even <
line 12611=>emed to  fall round him. His pony  reared and snorted,  <
line 12612=> fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others <
line 12613=>0m!' he  called.  'Pippin!  Merry! Come  along!  Why <
line 12614=>don't you keep up?' <
line 12615=>er. Fear  took him,  and he ran back  past the  stones <
line 12616=>shouting  wildly: 'Sam!  Sam! Merry! Pippin!' The pony bolted into  the mist  <
line 12617=>0ay off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: <
line 12618=>'Hoy!  Frodo! Hoy!' It was away eastward, on his left as he stood  under the <
line 12619=>raining into the gloom. He plunged off  in  the <
line 12620=>direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill. <
line 12621=>ggled  on he called again,  and kept on calling more and more <
line 12622=>frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it  seemed faint <
line 12623=>high above him. 'Frodo! Hoy!' came the thin voices out of <
line 12624=>the  mist:  and then  a cry that sounded  like  help, help!  often repeated, <
line 12625=>lp!  that trailed off into a  long wail  suddenly cut <
line 12626=>short.  He stumbled forward  with all the speed he could towards  the cries;  <
line 12627=>, and clinging night had closed about him, so that <
line 12628=>it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time  to be <
line 12629=> the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he  <
line 12630=>at last ca a ridge or hill. He was  weary, sweating  and yet <
line 12631=>chilled. It was wholly dark. <
line 12632=><
line 12633=>####-     'Where are you?' he cried out miserably. <
line 12634=>0He stood listening. He was suddenly aware  that  it <
line 12635=>was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy  <
line 12636=> the weather. The mist  was flowing  past him <
line 12637=>he mist  was flowing  past him d  tatters. His breath was smoking, and  the darkness  was  less <
line 12638=>near and  thick. He looked up  and saw with  surprise  that faint stars were <
line 12639=>ead amid the  strands of hurrying cloud  and  fog.  The wind <
line 12640=>began to hiss over the grass.  <
line 12641=>     He imagined suddenly that he  caught a muffled cry, and he made towards <
line 12642=>it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and <
line 12643=>tarry sky  was  unveiled.  A glance showed him  that he was now  facing <
line 12644=> round hill-top, which he must  have climbed from the <
line 12645=>north.  Out  of the east  the  biting wind was blowing. To his  right  there <
line 12646=> stars a dark  black  shape. A great barrow stood <
line 12647=>there. <
line 12648=>     'Where are you?' he cried again, both angry and afraid. <
line 12649=>     'Here!'  said a voice, deep and cold,  that seemed  to come out of  the <
line 12650=>0 you!' <
line 12651=>ut  he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell <
line 12652=>on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he <
line 12653=>looked <
line 12654=>dark  figure like a shadow against the stars.  It <
line 12655=>leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a <
line 12656=> from  some  remote  distance.  Then  a  grip <
line 12657=>mote  distance.  Then  a  grip er than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and <
line 12658=>he remembered no more. <
line 12659=>     When  he came to  himself again, for a  moment he could  recall nothing <
line 12660=>except a sense  of  dread. Then  suddenly  he  knew  that he was imprisoned, <
line 12661=>ly; he was in a barrow. A  Barrow-wight had taken him, and he <
line 12662=>was probably already under the  dreadful  spells of  the Barrow-wights about <
line 12663=>es spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself: <
line 12664=>flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast. <
line 12665=>     But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part  of the very <
line 12666=>darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo <
line 12667=> and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the <
line 12668=>0roads and adventures.  There  is  a seed of courage <
line 12669=><
line 12670=>####-hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid <
line 12671=>e final  and desperate danger to  make it grow. Frodo <
line 12672=>was neither  very  fat nor very  timid; indeed,  though he did not  know it, <
line 12673=>ught him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought <
line 12674=>he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought <
line 12675=> stiffening,  as if for a final spring; he no <
line 12676=>s if for a final spring; he no like a helpless prey. <
line 12677=>0e lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all <
line 12678=>was slowly giving way:  a pale greenish light was <
line 12679=>growing round him. It did not  at first show him what kind of a place he was <
line 12680=>  coming out of himself,  and from  the floor  <
line 12681=>himself,  and from  the floor   had not yet reached the roof or wall. He  turned, and there <
line 12682=>in  the  cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were <
line 12683=>on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale;  and they were  clad in <
line 12684=> About them lay many treasures, of  gold maybe,  though in that  light  <
line 12685=>nlovely.  On their  heads  were circlets, gold  chains <
line 12686=>ut their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by  <
line 12687=>0were  at their feet. But across their  three  necks <
line 12688=>lay one long naked sword. <
line 12689=> song began: a cold  murmur, rising and  falling.  The voice <
line 12690=>seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, <
line 12691=> moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad <
line 12692=>but horrible sounds, strings  of words would now and again shape  themselves:  <
line 12693=>rds,  heartless and miserable. The night  was  railing <
line 12694=>against the morning of  which it was bereaved,  and the cold was cursing the <
line 12695=>ed. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while <
line 12696=>the song became clearer, and  with  dread in  his heart he perceived that it <
line 12697=>n: <
line 12698=>and bone, <
line 12699=>p under stone: <
line 12700=>to wake on stony bed, <

line 12703=>     and still on gold here let them lie, <
line 12704=>and still on gold here let them lie, ts his hand <
line 12705=>and withered land. <
line 12706=>     He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself <
line 12707=>d saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind <
line 12708=>of  passage which  behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long  arm <
line 12709=>was groping,fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest,  and <
line 12710=>lt of the sword that lay upon him. <
line 12711=>f the sword that lay upon him. if he  had indeed been turned into stone by  the <
line 12712=>incantation.  Then a wild thought  of escape came to him. He wondered if  he <
line 12713=>put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight  would miss him, and he might find <
line 12714=> thought  of himself running free  over the grass, grieving <
line 12715=>for Merry, and Sam,  and Pippin,  but free and alive  himself. Gandalf would  <
line 12716=> been nothing else he could do. <
line 12717=>been nothing else he could do. een  awakened in  him was now   too strong: he <
line 12718=> his friends so easily.  He wavered, groping  in his pocket, <
line 12719=>and then fought with himself again; and as he did so  the arm  crept nearer. <
line 12720=>Suddardened  in him,  and  he seized a  short sword that lay <
line 12721=> him, and kneeling he stooped  low over the bodies of  his companions.  <
line 12722=>ad he hewed  at the crawling  arm near the wrist, and <
line 12723=>the hand broke off; but at the  same moment the sword  splintered up to  the  <
line 12724=> and the light vanished. In  the  dark there was a  <
line 12725=>snarling noise. <
line 12726=>ver Merry, and Merry's face felt cold. All at once <
line 12727=>back  into  his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of <
line 12728=>the  fog,  came the  memory  of the house down  under the Hill,  and  of Tom <
line 12729=>singing. He remembered  the rhyme  that  Tom  had taught  them. In  a  small <
line 12730=>desperate voice  he began: Ho!  Tom  Bombadil!  and with that name his voice <
line 12731=>ng: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber  <
line 12732=>echoed as if to drum and trumpet. <
line 12733=>et.    Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! <
line 12734=> Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! ll, by the reed and willow,  <
line 12735=>     By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! <
line 12736=>     Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us! <
line 12737=>eep  silence, in which Frodo could hear his  heart <

line 12746=>  streamed  in,  real  light, the plain light of  day.  A low <
line 12747=>door -like opening appeared  at the end of the  chamber beyond  Frodo's feet;  <
line 12748=>0's head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of <
line 12749=>the sun  rising red  behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the <
line 12750=>obbits lying beside Frodo. They  did not stir,  but the <
line 12751=>sickly hue had left them. They  looked now as  if they were only very deeply  <
line 12752=>d, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:  <
line 12753=>     Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight! <
line 12754=>     Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing, <
line 12755=>     Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains! <

line 12758=>ere gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended. <
line 12759=>     At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber  <
line 12760=> Then  there was  a long trailing shriek, fading away <
line 12761=>into an unguessable distance; and after that silence. <
line 12762=> Frodo!' said Tom. 'Let us get out on to clean  grass! You  <
line 12763=>must help me bear them.' <
line 12764=>     Together  they  carried  out Merry, Pippin, and Sam.  As Frodo left the <
line 12765=>barrow  forhe thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, <
line 12766=>ed  spider, in a heap of fallen  earth. Tom went back in again, <
line 12767=>humping and stamping. When he came out he <
line 12768=> stamping. When he came out he  arms a  great  load of  treasure:  things  of  gold, silver, <
line 12769=>copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He <
line 12770=>climbed <
line 12771=>the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine. <
line 12772=>     Tith his hat in his hand  and the wind in his hair, and <
line 12773=>looked down upon the  three hobbits, that had been  laid on their backs upon <
line 12774=>the grass  of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a  <
line 12775=>ommanding voice: <
line 12776=>     Wake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling! <
line 12777=> and limb! The cold stone is fallen; <
line 12778=>imb! The cold stone is fallen;  wide; dead hand is broken. <
line 12779=>##-     Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open! <
line 12780=>To Frodo's great joy the hobbits  stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed <
line 12781=>uddenly  sprang up. They  looked  about in amazement, <
line 12782=>first  at Frodo, and then at Tom standing  large  as life on  the barrow-top <
line 12783=>themselves in their thin  white rags, crowned and <
line 12784=>belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets.  <
line 12785=>of  wonder?' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet <
line 12786=>that had slipped over  one  eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his <
line 12787=>. 'Of course, I remember!' he  said. 'The men of <
line 12788=>Carn  Dym came on  us at  night,  and  we were worsted. Ah! the spear  in my <
line 12789=>heart!'  He  clutched at his  breast. 'No! No!'  he said,  opening his eyes.  <
line 12790=>0? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?' <
line 12791=>     'I thought that I  was lost,' said Frodo; 'but I don't want to speak of <

line 12793=>     'Dressed up like this, sir?' said Sam. 'Where are my clothes?' He flung <
line 12794=>his circlet, belt, and  rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly,  as <
line 12795=>if  he  expected  to  find  his  cloak,  jacket,  and  breeches,  and  other  <
line 12796=> somewhere to hand. <
line 12797=>     'You won't find  your clothes again,' said  Tom, bounding down from the <
line 12798=>ced round them in the  sunlight. One would have <
line 12799=>nothing dangerous  or dreadful  had happened;  and indeed the <
line 12800=>horror faded  out of their  hearts as they looked at him, and saw the  merry <
line 12801=><
line 12802=>Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half <
line 12803=> at him, half puzzled and half ' <
line 12804=> him, half puzzled and half '  saying: 'You've found yourselves again, out of <

line 12807=>d rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a -hunting!' <
line 12808=>     He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him <
line 12809=>g away southwards along the green  hollow between <
line 12810=>their <
line 12811=>hill and the next, still whistling and crying: <
line 12812=>he next, still whistling and crying: y now! Whither do you wander? <

line 12820=>     The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran  about for a while <
line 12821=>on the grass,  as he  told them. Then they lay basking  in the  sun with the <

line 12830=>own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them <
line 12831=> answered  to the  new names that Tom had given <
line 12832=>them <
line 12833=>for the rest of  their  lives. Tom called  them one by  one and they climbed <
line 12834=>a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.  <
line 12835=>hen Tom bowed to the hobbits.  ies, now!' he  said.  'They've  more  sense (in  some <

line 12849=>his words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old <
line 12850=>Tom's going to ride. Hey! he's coming with you, just to set you on the road; <

line 12854=>     The hobbits were delighted  to  hear this, and thanked  Tom many times;  <
line 12855=>said that they were so good at losing themselves that he  <
line 12856=>would  not  feel happy till he had seen them  safe over  the borders  of  his <

line 12861=>fairly early  by the sun, something between  nine and ten, <
line 12862=>and the hobbits turned their minds  to food. Their last meal  had been lunch <
line 12863=>beside  the  standing  stone the  day  before. They  breakfasted now off the <
line 12864=>remainder of  Tom's provisions,  meant for their supper, with additions that <
line 12865=>It was  not a large meal (considering hobbits  and <
line 12866=>the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating <
line 12867=>looked through the treasures. Most of these he <
line 12868=>he treasures. Most of these he  that glistened and  sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie <
line 12869=>there 'free to  all finders,  birds, beasts. Elves  or Men,  and  all kindly <
line 12870=>creatures'; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and <
line 12871=>ht  ever  come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch  <
line 12872=>,  many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue <
line 12873=>0es. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his <
line 12874=><

line 12878=>hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, <
line 12879=>of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. <
line 12880=> from their black sheaths,  wrought of  some strange <
line 12881=>metal,  light and  strong, and set with  many fiery stones.  Whether by some <
line 12882=>because of the spell  that lay on the mound, the <
line 12883=>blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun. <
line 12884=>     'Old  knives are long  enough  as  swords for  hobbit-people,' he said. <
line 12885=>d to have, if Shire-folk go walking , east,  south,  or  <
line 12886=>far away into dark  and danger.'  Then he told  them that these  blades were <

line 12893=>eedless.' <
line 12894=> not understand his  words, but as  he spoke they had a <
line 12895=>vision  as it  were of a  great expanse of  years  behind them,  like a vast  <
line 12896=>ch there strode  shapes  of Men, tall and grim  with <
line 12897=>bright swords,  and last came  one with a star on his  brow. Then the vision <
line 12898=>in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. <
line 12899=>They made ready,  packing  their  bags  and lading  their  ponies. Their new <
line 12900=>weapons they hung on their  leather belts under  their jackets, feeling them <

line 12910=>stones standing like  a gate, and before long they came to the  northern gap <

line 12918=>away  than  they  had  imagined. Even without a fog,  their sleep at mid-day <
line 12919=>ed them from reaching it  until after nightfall on the day <
line 12920=>before.  The dark line they had seen was  not  a line of trees but a line of <
line 12921=>edge  of a deep dike with  a steep wall on the further  <
line 12922=>side.  Tom said that it had once been  the boundary of a kingdom, but a very <

line 12927=>and then  Tom turned due north, for they  had been  bearing  somewhat to the <
line 12928=>d fairly level, and they quickened their pace, <
line 12929=>and they quickened their pace, s already sinking low when at  last  they saw a line of tall <
line 12930=>trees  ahead,  and they knew that they had come back  to the Road after many <
line 12931=>s.  They galloped their ponies  over  the last furlongs,  <
line 12932=>and halted u nder the long shadows of the trees. They  were on  the  top of a  <
line 12933=>he Road,  now dim as evening drew on, wound away  <
line 12934=>below <
line 12935=>them. At this point  it ran nearly  from South-west  to North-east,  and  on <
line 12936=>ckly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore <
line 12937=>many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes  full of <
line 12938=>ank and looked up and down. There was nothing <
line 12939=>up and down. There was nothing ll,  here we  are again at  last!'  said  Frodo.  'I suppose  we <
line 12940=>haven't  lost more than two days  by  my short  cut through the Forest!  But <
line 12941=>y will prove useful  - it may have put them off our trail.' <
line 12942=>     The others looked at  him.  The shadow of the fear of the  Black Riders <
line 12943=>came suddenly over them  again. Ever since they had entered  the Forest they <
line 12944=>had thought chiefly of getting back  to  the  Road;  only  now  when it  lay <

line 12956=>the  most  vague and  distant  legends  of the Shire, and in  the  gathering <

line 13005=>their own tales  they were the original inhabitants and wer e the descendants <

line 13039=>considering them dull  and uncouth. There were probably  many more <
line 13040=>Outsiders <

line 13233=>the Bree-folk, so  quickly  that, though they caught  many  names, they were <

line 13236=>Goatleaf,  Heathertoes,  Appledore, Thistlewool and  Ferny (not  to  mention  <

line 13250=>collect information about  hobbits living  outside the Shire,  especially in <

line 13262=>were <
line 13263=>on  the  move,  looking for   lands  where they  could  find some  peace. The <
line 13264=>Bree-folk were  sympathetic, but plainly  not  very  ready to  take  a large <
line 13265=>into  their little land. One  of  the  travellers,  a  <
line 13266=>squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling  that more  and more people <

line 13279=>re  several times, wanted to know where the  Underhills lived and who <
line 13280=>0###-     Suddenly  Frodo  noticed  that  a  strange-looking  weather -beaten man, <
line 13281=>sitting in  the  shadows near the  wall, was  also listening intently to the <
line 13282=>hobbit-talk. He had  a  tall tankard  in  front of him, and  was  smoking  a  <
line 13283=>e curiously carved. His legs  were stretched out before him, <
line 13284=>showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much <
line 13285=>ked with mud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-<
line 13286=>green <
line 13287=>cloth was  drawn  close  about him, and in spite of the heat of the room  he <
line 13288=>hadowed his  face; but the gleam of his eyes could be <
line 13289=>seen as he watched the hobbits. <
line 13290=>obbits. o is that?' Frodo asked, when he  got  a chance  to  whisper  to Mr. <
line 13291=>you introduced him?' <
line 13292=>     'Him?' said  the  landlord in  an  answering whisper,  cocking  an  eye <
line 13293=>without  turning his head. 'I don't rightly know. He is one of the wandering <
line 13294=>folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare <

line 13296=> was in and out  pretty  often last spring; but I  haven't  <

line 13323=>with  the fat  Mayor of  Michel  Delving, was  now actually  giving a  comic <

line 13329=>had probably heard rumours long ago about  Bilbo's vanishing. It would bring <
line 13330=>their minds,  especially  if there had been inquiries <
line 13331=>in Bree after that name. <
line 13332=>geted,  wondering  what to  do.  Pippin  was  evidently  much <
line 13333=>enjoying  the attention he was getting,  and had  become  quite forgetful of <
line 13334=>their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even <
line 13335=>mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.  <
line 13336=>     'You had better do something quick!' whispered Strider in his ear. <
line 13337=>     Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to  talk. The attention <
line 13338=>s disturbed. Some of the  hobbits looked at Frodo and <
line 13339=>laughed and clapped, thinking that  Mr. Underhill  had taken as  much ale as <
line 13340=>do  suddenly felt very foolish,  and found himself (as was his habit <

line 13847=>     Pippin  subsided; but  Sam was not  daunted, and he  still eyed Strider  <

line 13863=>I can save you, I will.' <
line 13864=>     There  was  a long silence.  At last Frodo  spoke  with  hesitation.  'I <

line 13874=>ve never seen it?'   know,' he answered. 'But I am Aragorn, and  those verses go <
line 13875=>with  that  name.' He  drew out his swor d,  and they saw that  the blade was <

line 13877=>Strider. 'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.' <

line 13933=>     'It seemed to make  off  up  the  Road,  eastward,' continued Merry. 'I  <

line 13940=>suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the  other  was <
line 13941=>whispering,  or  hissing. I  couldn't hear a word  that was said. I did  not <
line 13942=>cause  I  began  to  tremble  all over. Then  I  felt <

line 14344=>al less of me. I hope the  thinning process will not go on <
line 14345=>indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.' <
line 14346=>tely, or I shall become a wraith.'   such  things!'  said  Strider  quickly,  and  with <
line 14347=>surprising earnestness.  <
line 14348=>     The  hills drew nearer.  They  made an  undulating  ridge, often rising <
line 14349=>most to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or  <
line 14350=>passes leading into  the eastern land  beyond.  Along the crest of the ridge <
line 14351=>obbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and <
line 14352=>s there still stood the ruins  of old works of stone. <
line 14353=>By night they had reached  the feet of the westward  slopes, and there  they <

line 14355=>from Bree. <
line 14356=>     In the morning  they  found, for the first time since they had left the <
line 14357=>k  plain  to  see.  They  turned  right  and  followed  it <
line 14358=>southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep  <
line 14359=>sible from the view, both of the hill -tops above and of <
line 14360=>the  flats to the west. It dived into  dells,  and hugged steep  banks;  and <
line 14361=>tter and more open ground on either side of it there <
line 14362=>were lines of large  boulders and hewn stones that  screened the  travellers <
line 14363=>I wonder who made this path, and what for,' said Merry, as they walked <
line 14364=>along onnues, where  the  stones  were unusually  large  and <
line 14365=>closely  set. 'I am  not  sure that I like  it: it  has  a - well, rather  a  <
line 14366=>ere any barrow on Weathertop?' <
line 14367=>     'No. There  is no barrow on  Weathertop, nor  on  any of these  hills,' <
line 14368=>answered Strider. 'The  Men of  the West  did not live here; though in their <
line 14369=>latter days they defended  the hills for a while against  the evil that came <
line 14370=>This  path was made to serve the  forts along the walls. But <
line 14371=>long before,  in the first  days of  the North  Kingdom, they built  a great <
line 14372=>thertop,  Amon  Syl  they called  it.  It was burned and <
line 14373=>broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown <
line 14374=>  Yet once it was tall and  fair.  It is  told  that <
line 14375=>Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in <
line 14376=>e.' <
line 14377=> Strider. It seemed  that he  was  learned in old <
line 14378=>lore, as well as in  the ways of the wild. 'Who was Gil-galad?' asked Merry; <
line 14379=> seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low <
line 14380=>ost in thought. Suddenly a low      Gil-galad was an Elven-king. <
line 14381=>     Of him t sing: <

line 14393=>s fell his star    in Mordor where the shadows are. <
line 14394=>     The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam's. <
line 14395=>y. <
line 14396=>ammered  Sam, blushing.  'I learned  it from Mr. <
line 14397=>Bilbo when I was a lad. He used to  tell me tales  like that, knowing  how I <
line 14398=>was always one for  hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo  as taught  me  my <
line 14399=>mighty  book -learned was dear  old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote <
line 14400=>poetry. He wrote what I have just said.' <
line 14401=> He wrote what I have just said.'  up,' said Strider. 'It  is pan of the lay  that is <
line 14402=>called The Fall of Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have <
line 14403=>translated it. I never knew that.' <
line 14404=>ted it. I never knew that.' e,' said Sam,  'all about  Mordor.  I  didn't learn <
line 14405=>that part, it gave me the shivers I never thought I should be going that way <
line 14406=>o Mordor!' cried Pippin. 'I hope it won't come to that!' <
line 14407=>     'Do not speak that name so loudly!' said Strider. <
line 14408=>     It was  already  mid-day  when they  drew near the southern end of  the <
line 14409=>path, and saw before them,  in the pale  clear light  of the  October sun, a  <
line 14410=>0leading up like a  bridge on to  the northward slope of the <
line 14411=>hill They decided to make for the top at once,  while the daylight was broad <
line 14412=>nger  possible,  and they could only hope that no enemy <
line 14413=>or spy was observing  them. Nothing  was to be seen  moving  on the hill. If <
line 14414=>0t, there was no sign of him. <
line 14415=>     On the western flank  of Weathertop they  found a  sheltered hollow, at <
line 14416=>the  bottom of which  there was  a bowl -shaped dell with grassy sides. There <
line 14417=>they left  Sam  and Pippin with the pony and  their  packs and  luggage. The <
line 14418=>ter half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached the <
line 14419=>crown  of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last  <
line 14420=>ocky. <
line 14421=>0nd,  as  Strider had said,  a wide  ring of ancient <
line 14422=>stonework, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass. But in the centre a  <

line 14424=>About them  the turf  was  burned to the roots and all within the  ring  the <
line 14425=>led, as if flames had swept the hill-top; but <
line 14426=>es had swept the hill-top; but  of any living thing. <
line 14427=>0ding upon the  rim of the ruined circle,  they saw all round  below <
line 14428=>r the most pan of  lands empty  and  featureless,  <
line 14429=>except for patches of woodland away to the  south, beyond which  they caught <
line 14430=> distant water. Beneath them  on this southern <
line 14431=>Beneath them  on this southern  like  a  ribbon  the Old Road,  coming  out of the West and <
line 14432=>winding up and down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east. <
line 14433=>Nothing was moving on it. Following  its line eastward  with their eyes they  <
line 14434=>he Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; <
line 14435=>     behind them stood taller shapes of  grey, and  behind  those again were <
line 14436=>high whring among the clouds. <
line 14437=>     'Well, here we are!' said Merry. 'And very  cheerless and uninviting it <
line 14438=>nd no shelter. And no sign of Gandalf. But I don't  <
line 14439=>blame him for not waiting - if he ever came here.' <
line 14440=>trider, looking round thoughtfully. 'Even if he was a  <
line 14441=>day or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first.  He can ride <
line 14442=><
line 14443=>####-very swiftly when need presses.' Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone <
line 14444=>on the top of the  cairn; it was flatter than the others, and  whiter, as if <
line 14445=> He picked it up and examined it, turning  it in his <
line 14446=>fingers. "This has been  handled recently,' he said.  'What do you  think of <
line 14447=>flat under -side Frodo saw  some scratches: 'There seems to he a  <
line 14448=> strokes,' he said. <
line 14449=>     'The stroke  on the left  might  be a G-rune  with thin branches,' said <
line 14450=>Strider. 'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The <
line 14451=>ine, and they certainly look fresh. But the  marks might mean <
line 14452=>0omething  quite  different, and have  nothing  to do  with us.  Rangers use <
line 14453=>e here sometimes.' <
line 14454=>     'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?' asked Merry <
line 14455=>     'I  should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and  were a  <
line 14456=>sign that Gandalf was here on  October the third: that is three days ago now. <
line 14457=>It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he <
line 14458=>had no time or  did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is <

line 14460=>     'I wish we could  feel  sure that he made  the marks, whatever they may <

line 14463=>Strider. 'For myself, I believe that he was  here, and <
line 14464=>was in danger. There have been scorching flames here; and now the light that <
line 14465=>n the eastern sky comes back to  my  mind. I guess <
line 14466=>that he was attacked on this hill-top,  but with what result  I cannot tell. <
line 14467=>must now look aft er ourselves and make our own <
line 14468=>way to Rivendell, as best we can ' <
line 14469=>best we can ' ar  is  Rivendell?' asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The  world <
line 14470=>thertop. <
line 14471=>the Road has  ever  been measured in miles  beyond the <
line 14472=>Forsaken Inn, a day's  journey east of Bree,' answered Strider. 'Some say it <
line 14473=>herwise. It is a strange road,  and folk are  glad <
line 14474=>to reach their  journey's end, whether the time is long or short. But I know <
line 14475=> my  own  feet,  with fair  weather and no ill <
line 14476=> with fair  weather and no ill ays from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses <

line 14479=> 'A fortnight!' said Frodo. 'A lot may happen in that time.' <
line 14480=>     'It may,' said Strider. <
line 14481=>     They stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its southward edge. <
line 14482=>In  the   Frodo  for  the  first  time  fully  realized  his <
line 14483=>ness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in <
line 14484=>re.  He  stared down at the hateful Road,  leading <
line 14485=>back westward  - to his  home.  Suddenly he  was aware that  two black specks <
line 14486=>  going westward; and looking again he saw that <
line 14487=>three others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave a cry and clutched <
line 14488=>Strider's arm. <
line 14489=>0aid, pointing downwards.  <

line 14496=>aded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now <

line 14502=>enemy is here!' <
line 14503=>     Hastily they crept away  and slipped down the north side of the hill to <
line 14504=>companions.  <
line 14505=>grin had not been  idle. They  had explored the small dell <
line 14506=>and the surrounding slopes. Not far away they  found a spring of clear water  <
line 14507=>in the hillside, and near it footprints not  more than  a day or two old. In <
line 14508=>l itself they  found  recent traces of a fire, and  other  signs of a  <
line 14509=>ome fallen rocks on the edge of  the dell nearest to <
line 14510=>the  hill.  Behind  them  Sam  came upon  a  small store of  firewood neatly <
line 14511=>old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin. 'Whoever it <
line 14512=>was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.' <
line 14513=>     Strider  was greatly interested in  these discoveries.  'I  wish I  had <
line 14514=>  down here myself,' he said, hurrying off to  <
line 14515=>lf,' he said, hurrying off to   to examine the footprints.  <
line 14516=>   'It is just as I feared,' he said, when he came back.  'Sam  and Pippin <
line 14517=>ft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. Rangers <
line 14518=>have been  here lately. It  is  they who left the firewood behind. But there <
line 14519=>tracks  that were not made by Rangers. At least  one  <
line 14520=>set was made, only a day or two ago, by  heavy boots. At least one. I cannot  <
line 14521=>nk  there were many booted feet.'  He  paused  and <
line 14522=>stood in anxious thought. <
line 14523=>0hobbits  saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted <
line 14524=>Riders. If the horsemen had already  found  the dell, the sooner Strider led <
line 14525=>them  somewhere else  the better. Sam viewed  the hollow with great dislike, <
line 14526=>now that he had heard news of their  enemies on the  Road, only a few  miles <
line 14527=>0tter clear out quick, Mr.  Strider?' he asked impatiently. <
line 14528=>'It  is get ting late,  and  I  don't like this  hole: it makes my heart sink  <
line 14529=>,  we certainly must decide what to do  at once,' answered Strider, <
line 14530=>looking up the time and the weather. 'Well, Sam,' he said at <
line 14531=>last,  'I do not  like  th is  place either; but  I  cannot think of anywhere <

line 14533=>  At least we are out of sight  and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by <

line 14540=>used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the <
line 14541=>t in the daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you  <
line 14542=>saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.' <
line 14543=>     'I was too careless  on the  hill-top,' answered  Strider. 'I  was very <
line 14544=>me  sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us <
line 14545=>to go up and  stand  there  so long.  For the black horses  can see, and the <
line 14546=>other creatures as  spies, as we found at Bree.  They <
line 14547=>themselves  do not see the  world of light as we  do,  but our  shapes  cast  <
line 14548=>which only the  noon sun destroys; and in the dark <
line 14549=>they perceive many  signs and forms that are hidden from us:  then they  are <
line 14550=>t all times  they smell the blood  of living things,  <
line 14551=>desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other  than sight or smell. We <

line 14553=>and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,' he added, and his <
line 14554=>Ring draws them.' <
line 14555=>     'Is there no escape then?' said Frodo, looking round wildly. 'If I move <
line 14556=>I stay, I shall draw them to me!' <
line 14557=>tay, I shall draw them to me!' n his shoulder. 'There is still hope,' he said. <
line 14558=>one. Let us take  this wood that is set ready for the fire as <
line 14559=>a sign. There  is little  shelter or defence here,  but fire shall serve for  <

line 14561=>Riders do  not love it, and  fear those who wield  it. Fire is our friend in <
line 14562=>  'Maybe,'  muttered Sam.  'It  is also as good a way of saying "here  we <
line 14563=>are" f, bar shouting.' <
line 14564=>     Down in  the  lowest and most  sheltered corner of the dell  they lit a  <

line 14568=>The  lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly  places <
line 14569=>ted by all the races of the  world. Rangers passed  at times beyond the <
line 14570=>w and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of <

line 14574=>     'I don't see how our food can be  made  to  last,' said Frodo. 'We have <
line 14575=>been careful  enough in the  last few days, and  this supper is no feast; but <

line 14577=>'There is food in the wild,' said Strider; 'berry,  root, and herb; and <

line 14588=>cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe. <

line 14595=>of a story of the Elf-Kingdoms. 'Do you  know any more  of that old lay that <
line 14596=>you spoke of?' <
line 14597=>     'I do indeed,' answered Strider. 'So also does Frodo,  for  it concerns <
line 14598=>us closely.' Merry  and Pippin looked at Frodo,  who  was  staring  into the <
line 14599=>fire. <
line 14600=>     'I know  only the little that Gandalf has  told me,' said Frodo slowly. <
line 14601=>'Gil-galaf the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth. Gil-galad is <

line 14692=>ch, and this is  but a rough echo of it. It tells <
line 14693=>of the meeting of Beren son  of  Barahir and  LÂ®thien TinÂ®viel. Beren was  a <
line 14694=> the daughter of Thingol,  a King  of Elves upon <
line 14695=>Middle-earth when the world was young; and  she was the fairest  maiden that <
line 14696=>has ever been among all  the children of this world. As  the stars above the <
line 14697=>thern  lands was her loveliness,  and  in her  face  was a  <
line 14698=>shining light. In those days  the Great Enemy, of  whom Sauron of Mordor was <
line 14699=> in Angband  in the North,  and the  Elves of the  West <
line 14700=>coming back to Middle-earth made  war upon him to regain the Silmarils which <
line 14701=>0fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the  Enemy  was <
line 14702=>victorious  and Barahir  was slain,  and Beren escaping through great  peril <
line 14703=>rror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in  the <
line 14704=>forest of Neldoreth.  There he beheld LÂ®thien singing and dancing in a glade <
line 14705=>beside the enchanted  river Esgalduin; and  he named  her TinÂ®viel,  that is <
line 14706=>0e language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and <
line 14707=>they  were parted long. TinÂ®viel rescued Beren from  the dungeons of Sauron, <
line 14708=>ssed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great <
line 14709=>Enemy  from  his  throne, and took  from  his  iron  crown one of the  three <
line 14710=> all jewels, to  be  the  bride-price of LÂ®thien  to <
line 14711=>Thingol her father. Yet  at the last  Beren  was slain by the Wolf that came <
line 14712=>d, and he died in  the arms of TinÂ®viel.  But she <
line 14713=>chose mortality, and to die from  the world,  so that  she might follow him; <
line 14714=>again beyond the Sundering  Seas, and  after a  <
line 14715=>brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, <
line 14716=>long ago, beyond the confines of this  world. So it is that LÂ®thien TinÂ®viel <
line 14717=>0kindred has died indeed and left  the  world, and they have <
line 14718=>lost her  whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of <

line 14745=>     'Did you see anything?' asked Frodo, springing to his feet. <

line 14752=>     For a breathless  time  they sat there, silent  and  alert, with  their <
line 14753=>backs  turned to the  wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled <
line 14754=>them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or  movement in the night.  <
line 14755=> he must break the silence:  he longed  to  shout  out <
line 14756=>aloud. <

line 14758=> the  lip of the little dell, on the side away  from the hill, they <

line 14761=>####-strained their eyes, and the shadows  seemed to grow. Soon there could be no <
line 14762=>0r  tall black  figures  were standing  there  on the slope, <
line 14763=>looking down  on  them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes <
line 14764=>ind them. Frodo  thought that he heard  a faint hiss as <
line 14765=>of venomous breath  and felt a thin  piercing chill. Then the  shapes slowly <
line 14766=>0ercame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the <
line 14767=>ground. Sam shrank to Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his <
line 14768=>s quaking  as  if he was bitter cold,  but his  terror was <
line 14769=>swallowed  up in  a sudden temptation  to put on the Ring. The  desire to do  <
line 14770=>, and he could think of nothing else. He did not forget <
line 14771=>the Barrow,  nor  the  message  of  Gandalf;  but  something  seemed  to  be <
line 14772=>0ard  all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with  <
line 14773=>the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt <
line 14774=>nd put  it on his finger. He could not speak. He <
line 14775=>felt Sam looking at him, as if  he knew  that  his  master was in some great <
line 14776=>trouble, but  he could not turn  towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled <
line 14777=>resistance became unbearable, and at  last he  slowly drew <
line 14778=>out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand. <
line 14779=>erything  else remained as before,  dim and dark, <
line 14780=>the shapes became  terribly clear. He was able to  see beneath  their  black  <

line 14810=>heard  Frodo's  voice, but it seemed to  come from a great distance, or from <

line 14812=>led over the body of Frodo, lying as  if  dead,  face downwards  on the <
line 14813=>beneath  him. Strider ordered them to pick him up and <

line 14823=>     When he heard what Frodo had  to tell, he became full  of concern,  and <

line 14826=> and keep Frodo warm!' he said. Then he got up and <
line 14827=>walked  away, and called  Sam to him.  'I think I  understand  things better <

line 14844=>passed  slowly  and wearily.  Dawn was growing in the sky, and the  dell was <
line 14845=>filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned. <
line 14846=>tooping he lifted from the  ground a black cloak <
line 14847=>that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there <
line 14848=>was a slash. 'This was  the stroke of Frodo's sword,' he said. 'The only hurt <

line 14855=>the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only  <
line 14856=>the hilt in  Strider's hand. 'Alas!' he  cried. 'It was this accursed  knife <

line 14880=>ness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed <

line 15021=>the ache and sense of deadly chill took  away all sleep.  He lay tossing and <
line 15022=>ing fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks <
line 15023=>of  rock, water  dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling  fall of  a loosened <

line 15056=>narrow  saddle  between two  higher points, and the  land fell  steeply away <

line 15058=>ground shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder  felt <

line 15075=>if stone had once been  quarried there. They sat  huddled together. The wind <

line 15110=>broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way. <

line 15119=>     Outside the door they all  halted. There was  a  cave  or  rock -chamber  <

line 15266=>no sign of any  other  travellers  to be  seen. As  there  was now no  other  <
line 15267=>hem to  take,  they climbed down  the bank, and turning <
line 15268=><
line 15269=>####-left went off  as  fast as they could.  Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off <
line 15270=>fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to  meet them <
line 15271=>from the mountains ahead. <
line 15272=>     They were beginning  to look out  for a place  off the Road, where they <
line 15273=>en they heard a sound that  brought  sudden fear <
line 15274=>back  into their hearts: the  noise of  hoofs behind them. They looked back, <

line 15279=>bushes, they could see the Road, faint and  grey in  the failing light, some <
line 15280=> The sound of hoofs  drew  nearer.  They were  going  <
line 15281=>fast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. Then faintly,  as if it was blown <
line 15282=>ze,  they seemed  to catch a dim  ringing, as  of <
line 15283=>small bells tinkling. <
line 15284=>und like a Black Rider's horse!' said Frodo, listening <
line 15285=>intently. The  other  hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not,  but they all <
line 15286=>remained  full of suspicion.  They had been in  fear of pursuit for  so long <
line 15287=>that any sound from  behind seemed ominous and  unfriendly. But Strider  was <
line 15288=>to the  ground, with a  hand to  his ear, and a  <
line 15289=>look of joy on his face. <
line 15290=>, and  the leaves on the bushes  rustled softly. Clearer  <
line 15291=>and nearer  now the bells jingled, and clippety -clip  came the quick trotting <
line 15292=>feet. Suddenly into view below came a white  horse, gleaming in the shadows,  <
line 15293=>running swiftly. In the dusk its  headstall flickered and flashed,  as if it <
line 15294=>like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind <
line 15295=>him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in  the <
line 15296=>o it  appeared  that a  white  light was shining <
line 15297=>through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil. <

line 15338=>mist before his eyes had  darkened,  and he  felt  that a  shadow was coming <

line 15357=>chill lessen in  his  side  and arm;  a little  warmth crept  down from  his <
line 15358=> hand, and the pain grew easier. The  dusk of evening  seemed  <
line 15359=>to grow lighter  about him, as if  a cloud  had been  withdrawn.  He saw his  <

line 15381=><
line 15382=>####-time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and  even Strider seemed  by the  <

line 15388=>night were gone. <
line 15389=>     'Drink  this!'  said  Glorfindel  to  them, pouring for  each in turn a  <

line 15391=>f leather.  It  was  clear  as d  had no taste, and it did not feel either  cool or warm in <

line 15397=>again. Glorfindel  still  urged them  on, and  only allowed two brief  halts <
line 15398=>during the day's  march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before <
line 15399=>a  point where the Road bent  right  and  ran down <
line 15400=> bottom of the valley,  now making  straight for the Bruinen. So  <
line 15401=> sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or  <
line 15402=>hear; but often  Glorfindel would  halt and  listen  for  a moment, if  they <

line 15407=>weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs.  Frodo's <

line 15426=>the bottom  of a sharp incline  they saw before  them a long  flat mile, and <
line 15427=> that  the  Ford of Rivendell. On  the  further side was a steep brown <

line 15438=>the gate in the  trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined <

line 15452=>last lap of  the Road. At the same moment the  black horses leaped  down the <
line 15453=>hill in pursuit, and from  the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had <

line 15529=>of memory. Or  perhaps he  had been ill? But  the ceiling looked strange; it <

line 15538=>all the absurd  things you  have done since  you left home.' Frodo lay  down <
line 15539=>again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did <
line 15540=>get the better of  an argument.  He  was fully awake now,  <
line 15541=>and  the memory of  his  journey  was returning: the  disastrous `short cut' <
line 15542=> the `accident' at The Prancing Pony;  and his madness <
line 15543=>in putting  on the Ring  in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking <
line 15544=>rying  in  vain to  bring  his memory down to  his <
line 15545=>arriving  in  Rivendell, there  was a long  silence, broken only by the soft  <

line 15730=>     'And is that the end of the Black Riders?' asked Frodo. <
line 15731=>     'No,' said Gandalf. 'Their horses must have perished,  and without them <
line 15732=>they  are crippled.  But  the  Ringwraiths  themselves cannot  be  so easily <

line 15760=>g-finder.'    `Dear Bilbo!' said Frodo sleepily. `I wonder where he is. I wish he was <
line 15761=> all  about it.  It would have  made  him laugh, The cow <

line 15763=>asleep. <
line 15764=>     Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea. That house <
line 15765=>was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, `a perfect house, whether you like food <

line 15767=>leasant  mixture  of  them all'.  Merely  to  be  there was  a cure  for  <

line 15782=>     At that moment there  was a knock on the door,  and Sam came in. He ran <
line 15783=>to Frodo and took his left hand,  awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it  gently  <
line 15784=>and then he blushed and turned hastily away. <

line 15786=>and turned hastily away. d Frodo. d Sam. `Meaning your hand, Mr.  Frodo. It has  felt so <

line 15788=>round again with shining  eyes and dancing  on  the floor. 'It's fine to see <

line 15802=>s!'   Sam led him  along several passages and down many steps and out  into a <
line 15803=>  steep bank of the river. He found his friends sitting <
line 15804=>in a  porch on the side of the house looking east. Shadows had fallen in the <
line 15805=>0was still a light on the faces of the mountains far <
line 15806=>above. The air was warm. The sound of running  and falling  water  was loud, <
line 15807=>ith a  faint scent  of trees and flowers, as if <
line 15808=><
line 15809=>####-summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens.  <
line 15810=> springing  up.  `Here is our noble cousin! Make <

line 15817=>     `Gandalf  has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said Pippin. <
line 15818=>`He thinks I need keeping in  order.  But it  seems impossible, somehow,  to  <

line 15825=>     `More than meal!  A  feast!'  said  Merry. `As soon as Gandalf reported <
line 15826=>that  you were  recovered, the  preparations began.' He  had hardly finished <
line 15827=>speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells. <
line 15828=>se was filled with folk: Elves  for  the  most  <
line 15829=>here wer e a  few guests of other  sorts.  Elrond, as  was his <
line 15830=>custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and <
line 15831=> one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.  <
line 15832=>     Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of <
line 15833=>ke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left,  <
line 15834=>Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were <
line 15835=>revealed <
line 15836=>0ower. Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other <
line 15837=>two; but his  long  white  hair, his  sweeping silver beard, and  his  broad <
line 15838=> some wise king of ancient  legend. In his aged <
line 15839=>face under  great snowy brows  his dark eyes  were set like coals that could <
line 15840=>leap suddenly into fire. <
line 15841=>     Glorfindel  was tall and straight;  his  hair was of shining gold,  his <
line 15842=>0earless and full  of  joy; his eyes were bright and <
line 15843=>keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and  in his hand was <
line 15844=>Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was <
line 15845=><
line 15846=>####-written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark <
line 15847=>of twilight, and upon  it  was set  a circlet  of silver; his <
line 15848=>eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of <
line 15849=> seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale <
line 15850=>as  a tried warrior in  the  fulness  of  his strength.  He was the Lord  of <

line 15852=>     In  the  middle of the table, against  the  woven cloths upon the wall, <
line 15853=>there  was a chair under  a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look  upon, <
line 15854=>and so like was she in form of womanhood  to Elrond that Frodo  guessed that <
line 15855=>dred. Young she was  and yet not so. The braids <
line 15856=>ir were touched  by no frost, her white arms and  clear  face <
line 15857=>were  flawless and smooth,  and the light  of stars was in  her bright eyes,  <
line 15858=>s night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge <
line 15859=>were in  her  glance, as  of  one  who has known  many things that the years <

line 15861=>with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament <

line 15867=>s,  and  was  but  lately  returned to Rivendell  to her  <
line 15868=>father's  house.  But  her  brothers, Elladan and  Elrohir,  were  out  upon <

line 15870=>forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the orcs.  <
line 15871=>     Such loveliness  in  living  thing  Frodo had  never  seen  before  nor  <

line 15873=>had a seat at  Elrond's table among all these  folk so high and fair. Though <
line 15874=>d was raised upon several  cushions, he felt very <
line 15875=>small, and  rather out of place; but that  feeling quickly passed. The feast  <
line 15876=>hat his  hunger could desire. It was some time <
line 15877=>could desire. It was some time  about him again or even turned to his neighbours. <
line 15878=>     He  looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be  allowed to wait <
line 15879=>on his  master, but had been  told that  for this  time he  was  a  guest of <

line 15881=>end  of  one of  the side-tables close to  the dais. He could see no sign of <
line 15882=>Strider. <
line 15883=><
line 15884=>####-     Next to Frodo  on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly <
line 15885=>dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was  white, nearly as white as the <
line 15886=>ite cloth  of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck  <
line 15887=>nd diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him. <
line 15888=>  and well met!'  said the dwarf, turning towards  him. Then he <
line 15889=> bowed. `Gluin at your service,' he said, and <
line 15890=>at your service,' he said, and . <
line 15891=>your service,' he said, and . r  service  and  your   family's,'  said  Frodo <
line 15892=>correctly, rising  in surprise and scattering  his cushions. 'Am I right  in <

line 15894=>Thorin Oakenshield?' <
line 15895=>d  the dwarf,  gathering up  the  cushions  and <
line 15896=>courteously assist ing  Frodo back  into his seat. 'And I do  not ask, for  I <

line 15900=>  `Thank you very much,' said Frodo.  strange  adventures, I hear,'  said  Gluin. 'I  <
line 15901=>wonder greatly  what brings  four hobbits  on so long a journey. Nothing like <
line 15902=>it  has happened  since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire <
line 15903=>te Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?' <
line 15904=>     'I  think  we  will not  speak  of it,  at least not  yet,' said  Frodo <
line 15905=>politely. <
line 15906=>     He guessed that  even in Elrond's house the matter of  the Ring was not <
line 15907=>one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his  troubles for a  <
line 15908=>time. 'But  I am  equally  curious,'  he  added,  `to learn what  brings  so <
line 15909=>he Lonely Mountain.' <
line 15910=>     Gluin looked at him. 'If you have not heard, I  think we will not speak <
line 15911=> Elrond will summon us all ere long,  I believe, <
line 15912=>and  then we shall all hear many things. But there is much else that  may be <
line 15913=>told.' <
line 15914=>t  of  the  meal  they talked  together,  but  Frodo <
line 15915=>listened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart from the Ring, <
line 15916=>d unimportant. while  Gluin had much to tell  of <
line 15917=>events in the northern regions of Wilderland.  Frodo  learned that Grimbeorn <
line 15918=>the Old, son of  Beorn, was now the lord  of  many sturdy men ,  and to their  <
line 15919=> Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go.  <
line 15920=>     'lndeed,' said Gluin,  `if it were not for  the  Beornings, the passage <
line 15921=>ivendell  would long  ago  have become  impossible. They are <
line 15922=>valiant men and keep open  the High Pass  and the Ford of Carrock. But their <
line 15923=>added with a shake of his  head;  `and like Beorn of old <
line 15924=>they are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty,  and that is much <
line 15925=>re there any men so friendly to  us  as the  Men  of <
line 15926=>Dale. They  are  good  folk,  the Bardings. The  grandson of Bard the Bowman <
line 15927=>ain  son of Bard. He is a  strong king.  and his <
line 15928=>realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth.' <
line 15929=> people?' asked Frodo. <
line 15930=>     `There is much  to tell, good and bad,' said  Gluin; 'yet it  is mostly <
line 15931=>good:  we have so far been fortunate, though  we do not escape the shadow of <
line 15932=>these  times. If you  really  wish  to  hear of us, I will tell  you tidings <
line 15933=>u are  weary!  Dwarves'  tongues  run  on when <
line 15934=>warves'  tongues  run  on when r handiwork, they say.' <
line 15935=>     And with that  Gluin embarked on a long  account of the doings  of  the <
line 15936=>0elighted  to have found  so polite a  listener; for  <
line 15937=>Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, <
line 15938=>ot rather lost among the strange names of people <
line 15939=>and places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to <
line 15940=>hear that Dbin was  still  King under the  Mountain, and was now old (having <
line 15941=>ndred  and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich. <
line 15942=>Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies  seven were <
line 15943=>, Gluin, Dori, Nori,  Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur <
line 15944=>was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at <
line 15945=>ng dwarves to lift him. <
line 15946=>     'And what has become of Balin and Ori and Uin?' asked Frodo. <
line 15947=>     A shadow passed  over Gluin's face.  `We do not know,' he answered. 'It <
line 15948=>is largely  on account of  Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those <
line 15949=>that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak of merrier things!' <
line 15950=>     Gluin began then  to talk  of the works of  his  people,  telling Frodo <
line 15951=> labours in Dale  and under the  Mountain. 'We have  done <
line 15952=>well,' he  said. `But  in  metalwork  we cannot rival  our fathers, many  of <
line 15953=>. We make good armour and keen swords, but  we cannot <
line 15954=>again make mail or blade  to match  those  that were  made before the dragon <
line 15955=>ilding have we surpassed the old days. You should <
line 15956=>see  the  waterways of Dale,  Frodo, and the fountains, and  the pools!  You  <
line 15957=>roads  of  many  colours! And  the  halls  and <
line 15958=> colours! And  the  halls  and streets under the earth with  arches  carved  like trees;  and the <
line 15959=>terraces and  towers upon the Mountain's  sides! Then you would  see that we <
line 15960=>idle.' <
line 15961=>     'I will come and see them, if  ever I can,' said  Frodo. 'How surprised <
line 15962=>d have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!' <
line 15963=>smiled. 'You were very fond of Bilbo were you <
line 15964=>re very fond of Bilbo were you      `Yes,' answered Frodo. 'I would rather see him than all  the towers and <
line 15965=>ld.' <
line 15966=>     At length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down <
line 15967=>d the company followed them in due  order. The doors were thrown <
line 15968=>wide passage and through other doors, and came <
line 15969=> through other doors, and came all.  In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in <
line 15970=>a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side. <
line 15971=>     Frodo found himself  walking with  Gandalf. `This  is the Hall of Fire' <
line 15972=> you will hear many songs and  tales-if you  can keep <
line 15973=>awake. But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people <
line 15974=>e,  and thought. There is always a fire here, all  <
line 15975=>the year round, but there is little other light.' <
line 15976=>0d  went towards  the seat prepared for  him, elvish <
line 15977=>minstrels began to  make sweet  music.  Slowly  the hall  filled,  and Frodo <
line 15978=>e many  fair faces that were gathered together; <
line 15979=>the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in  their hair. Suddenly <
line 15980=>he noticed, not far from the further  end of  the fire, a small dark  figure <
line 15981=>ith his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on  the <
line 15982=>ground was a drinking-cup  and some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was <
line 15983=>ll in Rivendell), and had been unable  to  come to the <
line 15984=>feast. His head seemed sunk  in sleep on  his breast, and a fold of his dark <
line 15985=>ace. <
line 15986=>and stood beside the  silent figure. 'Awake  little <
line 15987=>master.  he  said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him. <
line 15988=>ome that you have wished  for, Frodo,' he said. <
line 15989=>`Here is a friend that you have long missed.' <
line 15990=>long missed.'      The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face. <
line 15991=>     `Bilbo!' cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward. <
line 15992=>lad!' said Bilbo.  `So  you have got here at  last. I <
line 15993=><
line 15994=>####-hoped you would manage it. Well,  well! So  all this  feasting  is  in  your <
line 15995=>e you enjoyed yourself?' <
line 15996=>     'Why weren't  you there?' cried Frodo.  `And why haven't I been allowed <
line 15997=>  `Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by <
line 15998=>your ach day. But as for  the feast` I don't go in  for such <
line 15999=>things much now. And I had something else to do.' <
line 16000=>doing?' <
line 16001=>thinking.  I do  a lot of that  nowadays, and this is <
line 16002=>the best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!' he said, cocking an <
line 16003=>  bright  twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness <
line 16004=>that Frodo could see. `Wake up! I was not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want <
line 16005=> out from your  feast too  soon, and  you have <
line 16006=>feast too  soon, and  you have the middle of making up a song. I was stuck  over a line  or  <
line 16007=>two, and was thinking  about them; but  now I don't suppose I shall ever get  <
line 16008=>them right.  There will  be such a deal of singing  that  the  ideas wi ll be <
line 16009=>ven clean out  of my head.  I  shall have to get my friend the DÂ®nadan to <
line 16010=>?' <
line 16011=>all  be found,' he  said. `Then you two shall go <
line 16012=>into a corner  and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before <
line 16013=>we end our merrymaking.' Messengers were sent to find Bilbo's friend, though <
line 16014=> was, or why he had not been present at the feast. <
line 16015=>     In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly <
line 16016=>They talked together in soft voices, oblivious <
line 16017=>ther in soft voices, oblivious  music in the hall about them.  Bilbo had not much to say of <
line 16018=>himself. When  he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the <
line 16019=>Road or in the country on either side;  but  somehow  he had steered all the <
line 16020=>owards Rivendell. `I got here without  much adventure,' he  said, `and <
line 16021=>with  the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan't  <
line 16022=>0ain.  Old  Balin had gone away. Then I came  back  here, and here I  <
line 16023=>s and that. I have  written some more of my  book. <
line 16024=>And, of course, I make  up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to <
line 16025=>please  me,  I course,  they aren't really  good  enough for  <
line 16026=>I listen and  I think. Time doesn't seem to pass here: it just  <
line 16027=>er. <
line 16028=>  news,  from  over the Mountains, and out of the <
line 16029=>South,  but  hardly  anything  from the Shire.  I heard  about  the Ring, of <
line 16030=>here often. Not  that he has told me a  great deal, <
line 16031=>he has become closer than ever these last few years. The DÂ®nadan has told me <
line 16032=>e causing such a disturbance! It  is a pity that <
line 16033=>Gandalf did not find out more sooner. I  could  have brought  the thing here <
line 16034=>myself  long ago without  so much trouble. I have  thought several  times of <
line 16035=>iton for it; but I am getting old, and they  would not let <
line 16036=>me: Gandalf and Elrond,  I  mean.  They seemed  to  think that the Enemy was <
line 16037=>or me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught <
line 16038=>me <
line 16039=>tottering about in the Wild. <
line 16040=>     'And Gandalf said: "The Ring has passed on,  Bilbo. It would do no good <
line 16041=>u tried to meddle  with it  again." Odd  sort  of <
line 16042=>remark,  just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after  you, so I  let <

line 16046=>curious,  you know, after all I've heard. I  should very much like  just  to <
line 16047=>peep at it again.' <
line 16048=>     `Yes, I've  got  it,' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. `It <
line 16049=>s ever it did.' <
line 16050=>hould just lik e to see it for a moment,' said Bilbo. <
line 16051=>     When he had dressed, Frodo found  that while he slept the Ring had been <
line 16052=>hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. <
line 16053=>Bilbo  put  out  his hand.  But Frodo  quickly drew  back the Ring.  To  his <
line 16054=>distress  and  amazement he found that he was no  longer looking at Bilbo; a  <
line 16055=>  have fallen between them, and through it he found  himself <
line 16056=>eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands.  <
line 16057=>He felt a desire to strike him. <
line 16058=>re to strike him. d singing round them seemed  to falter and a silence fell. <
line 16059=>Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes. `I  <
line 16060=>said. `Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have  come in <
line 16061=>for this burden: sorry about everything.  Don't adventures ever have an end?  <
line 16062=>lse always has to carry on the story. Well, it can't  <
line 16063=>be helped. I wonder if it's any good  trying  to finish my  book? But  don't <
line 16064=>et 's have some real News! Tell  me all about  the <
line 16065=>Shire!' <
line 16066=>     Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly  a  shred <
line 16067=>e light  and music  of  Rivendell was about  him again. Bilbo <
line 16068=>smiled  and laughed happily. Every  item  of news  from the Shire that Frodo <
line 16069=>nd corrected now and again  by  Sam-was  of the  greatest  <
line 16070=>interest to  him, from the felling of  the least tree to the  pranks of  the <
line 16071=>bbiton. They were so deep in  the doings  of  the Four <
line 16072=>Farthings that they did not  notice  the arrival of a man clad in dark green <

line 16074=>ing down at them with a smile.  looked  up. 'Ah, there you are  at last,  DÂ®nadan!' he <
line 16075=>cried. <
line 16076=>     `Strider!' said Frodo. `You seem to have a lot of names.' <
line 16077=>     `Well, Strider is one that I haven't heard before, anyway,' said Bilbo. <
line 16078=>l him that for?' <
line 16079=>     `They call me that in Bree,' said Strider laughing, 'and that is how  I <
line 16080=>was introduced to him.' <
line 16081=>     `And why do you call him DÂ®nadan?' asked Frodo. <
line 16082=>an,' said Bilbo. `He is often called that here. But I thought <
line 16083=>you  knew  enough  Elvish  at  least to  know  dÂ®n-udan: Man  of  the  West, <
line 16084=>his is not the time for lessons!' He turned to Strider. <
line 16085=>     `Where have you been, my friend? Why weren't you at the feast? The Lady <
line 16086=>0trider looked down at Bilbo gravely. `I  know,'  he said. 'But often I <
line 16087=>must putlladan  and Elrohir  have returned  out  of the Wild <
line 16088=>unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.' <
line 16089=>     `Well, my  dear fellow,' said  Bilbo, `now you've heard the news, can't  <
line 16090=>  I want your help in  something urgent.  Elrond says <

line 16093=>     Strider smiled. `Come then!' he said. `Let me hear it!' <
line 16094=>     Frodo  was left  to himself  for a while. for Sam had fallen asleep. He <
line 16095=>was  alone and felt rather forlorn`  although  all  about  him  the  folk of <
line 16096=>Rivendell were gathered. But  those near  him were silent,  intent upon  the <
line 16097=>music of the voices and the instruments. and they  gave no heed to  anything <
line 16098=>an to listen. <
line 16099=>     At first the beauty of the  melodies  and  of  the interwoven  words in <
line 16100=>en-tongues, even though he understood  them little` held him in  a spell, <
line 16101=>to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took  <
line 16102=>shape, and  visions of  far la nds  and  bright things that he had  never yet <
line 16103=><
line 16104=>####-imagined  opened out before him;  and the firelit  hall became like a golden <
line 16105=>mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the  world. Then the <
line 16106=>ore and more dreamlike, until  he  felt  that an endless <
line 16107=>river of  swelling gold  and  silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous <
line 16108=>omprehended;  it  became part of  the throbbing  air <
line 16109=>about him, and  it  drenched and  drowned him. Swiftly  he  sank  under  its <
line 16110=>ealm of sleep. <
line 16111=>andered long in a dream of  music  that turned  into running <
line 16112=>water, and  then suddenly into a  voice. It seemed  to be the voice of Bilbo <

line 16283=>elight in  Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug of  regret as they <

line 16297=>star shone  on his breast.  They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed  <
line 16298=>urned towards him, and the light of  her eyes  fell on <
line 16299=>him from afar and pierced his heart. <
line 16300=>heart.    He  stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song <
line 16301=>wels  of blended  word  and melody. `It  is  a  song  to <

line 16306=>ugh  the   window   at  the  bright  stars  above   the <
line 16307=>steep-climbing  woods, and  talking softly. They  spoke no more of the small <
line 16308=>0away, nor  of  the dark  shadows  and  perils  that <
line 16309=>encompassed  them,  but  of  the  fair  things  they  had seen in the  world <

line 16321=>to see you again! There are no folk like  hobbits  after all for a real good <

line 16330=>silver mist;  the dew upon the  yellow leaves was glimmering, and  the woven <

line 18123=>olly-bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from <
line 18124=> flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought <
line 18125=>they were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense <

line 18135=>also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move <

line 18144=>if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!' said Pippin. The news: no <
line 18145=>fire, and a move again  by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke <
line 18146=>ernoon. 'All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward <

line 18158=>these strange lands  seemed so vast that he was quite <

line 18625=>of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones. <

line 18633=>over the brow of the  hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a  <
line 18634=>dark wolf-shape  could be seen halted, gazing at <
line 18635=>them.  A shuddering howl  broke from him, as if he  were a captain summoning <
line 18636=>his pack to the assault. <
line 18637=>     Gandalf stood  up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. 'Listen, <

line 18642=>hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to  the ground; the elvish arrow <
line 18643=>had  pierced  its  throat. The  watching  eyes were  suddenly  extinguished. <
line 18644=>Gandalf  and  Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting <
line 18645=>out them  the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on <
line 18646=>the sighing wind. <

line 18648=>y  through the breaking clouds.  Suddenly  Frodo started  from sleep. <

line 18654=>shapes spring over  the  ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the <
line 18655=>lþleader  Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with  a  <
line 18656=>great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood <
line 18657=>with <
line 18658=>his  stout  legs apart,  wielding  his  dwarf-axe.  The  bow of  Legolas was <
line 18659=>singing. <
line 18660=> Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, <
line 18661=> suddenly to grow: he rose up,  shape like the monument of some ancient king of  stone set <
line 18662=>upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to <

line 18664=>  brand.  It flared with a  sudden white radiance like lightning; and <

line 18668=>leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt  from tree-top to tree-top. <
line 18669=>The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the <
line 18670=>0 shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in  the air <

line 18674=>a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the <

line 18676=>routed and did not return. <
line 18677=>  tell  you,  Mr. Pippin?  ' said Sam, she/thing his  sword. <
line 18678=>`Wolves won't get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed <
line 18679=>the hair off my head!' <
line 18680=>     When  the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to <
line 18681=>be found, and they  looked in vain for the  bodies of the  dead. No trace of <
line 18682=>the fight remained but the  charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on <
line 18683=>the hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left. <
line 18684=>`It is as  I feared,'  said Gandalf.  `These  were no  ordinary  wolves <
line 18685=> wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!' <
line 18686=>s. Let us eat quickly and go!' ther changed again, almost as if it was at the command  <
line 18687=>of some power that had no longer  any use for snow, since they had retreated <
line 18688=>from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in  which things <
line 18689=>that  moved  in the  wild could be  seen from far away.  The  wind  had been <
line 18690=>th-west during the night, and now it failed. The <
line 18691=>clouds  vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue.  As  they <
line 18692=>stood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over  the <
line 18693=>mountain-tops.  <
line 18694=>     `We must reach  the doors before sunset,' said Gandalf,  'or I  fear we <
line 18695=>shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for  <
line 18696=> Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only <
line 18697=> the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago. <
line 18698=> lies,' he said,  pointing away south-eastwards to where  the <
line 18699=>mountains' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet.  In the distance <
line 18700=>n a line of bare cliffs,  and in their midst, taller than <
line 18701=>the rest, one great grey wall. `When we left the pass I  led you southwards,  <

line 18705=>is needed. Let us go! ' <
line 18706=>o hope,' said  Boromir grimly: `that Gandalf will <
line 18707=>seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost <
line 18708=> and to be caught between wolves and the wall  <
line 18709=>t between wolves and the wall  ance. Lead on!' <
line 18710=>and the wall  ance. Lead on!' walked ahead by the wizard's side, so eager was he to come to <
line 18711=>Moria. Together they led  the Company back towards the  mountains. The  only <
line 18712=>ia from the  west  had lain along the course of a stream, <
line 18713=>the Sirannon,  that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors <
line 18714=>Gandalf was astray,  or  else the land had changed in <
line 18715=>recent years; for he  did not strike the stream where he  looked to  find it, <
line 18716=>s from their start. <
line 18717=>     The morning was  passing towards noon,  and still the  Company wandered <
line 18718=>ntry  of red stones. Nowhere could they see any <
line 18719=>gleam of  water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts <
line 18720=>0ank.  They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the <
line 18721=>night  would bring, if it caught them in that  lost land, none of them cared <
line 18722=>ink. <
line 18723=>     Suddenly Gimli, who  had pressed on ahead, called back  to them. He was <
line 18724=> a knoll and pointing to the  right. Hurrying up they saw  below <
line 18725=>el. It was  empty and  silent,  and  hardly  a  <
line 18726=>trickle of water flowed among the  brown and red-stained  stones of its bed;  <
line 18727=>but  on the  near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound <
line 18728=>its way among the ruined walls and paving -stones of an ancient highroad. <
line 18729=>h! Here it is at last! ' said Gandalf. `This is where the stream ran: <
line 18730=>Sirannon, the  Gate-stream, they used  to call  it. But what has happened to <
line 18731=>the water,  I cannot guess; it used  to  be swift  and noisy.  Come! We must  <
line 18732=>  The Company were  footsore and tired; but they  trudged  doggedly along <
line 18733=>the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and <
line 18734=>began  to go west. After  a brief halt  and a hasty meal they went on again. <
line 18735=>0s frowned, but  their path lay in a deep  trough of <
line 18736=>land  and  they  could  see only  the higher shoulders and the  far eastward <
line 18737=>peaks. <
line 18738=>     ame  to a sharp  bend. There  the road, which had  been <
line 18739=>veering southwards between the brink of the channel and  a steep fall of the <
line 18740=>0urned and went due east again. Rounding  the corner  they <
line 18741=>saw  before them a  low  cliff, some  five fathoms  high, with a  broken and <
line 18742=>a trickling water  dripped, through a wide cleft that <
line 18743=>seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been  strong and full.  <
line 18744=>     `Indchanged! ' said Gandalf. `But there is no mistaking <
line 18745=>  There  is  all  that remains of the  Stair Falls. If I remember  <
line 18746=>f steps cut  in the  rock at their side, but the <
line 18747=>main road  wound away left and climbed with several  loops  up  to the level <
line 18748=>ground at  the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right <
line 18749=>up to the Walls of  Moria, and the Sirannon flowed  through it with the road <
line 18750=>de it. Let us go and see what things are like now! ' <
line 18751=>     They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly <
line 18752=>up them,  fof and Frodo.  When they reached the top they saw <
line 18753=>ld go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of <
line 18754=>the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind  them the sinking Sun filled  the  cool  <
line 18755=>0glimmering  gold. Before them stretched a dark still  lake. <
line 18756=>Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had <
line 18757=>lþfilled  all the valley.  Beyond the  ominous water were <
line 18758=>reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in  the fading light: final and <
line 18759=>impassablte or entrance,  not a fissure or crack could Frodo <
line 18760=>frowning stone. <
line 18761=>e  the  Walls  of  Moria,' said Gandalf,  pointing across the <
line 18762=>water. `And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end <
line 18763=>of the road from Hollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None <
line 18764=>of  the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this  gloomy water at the end  of <
line 18765=>holesome look.' <
line 18766=>     `We  must find a way round the northern  edge,' said Gimli. `The  first  <
line 18767=>thing for the  Company to  do is to climb up  by the main path and see where <
line 18768=>.  Even  if  there were  no  lake,  we could not  get  our <
line 18769=>baggage-pony up this stair.' <
line 18770=>     `But in any  case we cannot take the poor  beast  into the Mines,' said <
line 18771=> the mountains is a dark road, and there are  places <
line 18772=>narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.' <
line 18773=>ill! ' said Frodo. `I had not thought of that. And poor Sam!  <
line 18774=>I wonder what he will say?  ' <
line 18775=>     `I am sorry,' said Gandalf. `Poor Bill has  been a useful companion and <
line 18776=>it goes  to  my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter  <
line 18777=><
line 18778=>####-and brought no animal, least of  all  this one that Sam is fond of, if I had <
line 18779=>had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.' <
line 18780=>  The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky <
line 18781=>, when the  Company,  with all  the speed  they  could,  <
line 18782=>climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked <
line 18783=> or three furlongs at the widest point.  How far  it <
line 18784=>stretched  away  southward they could  not see in the failing light; but its <
line 18785=>n half a mile from where they stood, and between <
line 18786=>the  stony ridges  that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a  <
line 18787=>d forward, for they had still  a mile  or two <
line 18788=>they had still  a mile  or two y could reach the point on the  far shore that  Gandalf was <
line 18789=>making for; and then he had still to find the doors. <
line 18790=>     When  they came to the northernmost corner of  the  lake  they  found a  <
line 18791=>r way. It was green and stagnant,  thrust  out <
line 18792=>een and stagnant,  thrust  out arm  towards  the  enclosing  hills.  Gimli  strode  forward <
line 18793=>undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at <
line 18794=>the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for  <
line 18795=>  the  weedy  pools were sliding  and  greasy  stones, and footing  was <
line 18796=>treacherous. Frodo shuddered  with disgust at  the touch of the dark unclean <
line 18797=>0his feet. <
line 18798=>st of the Company, led Bill up  on to the dry ground on <
line 18799=>r side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a  <
line 18800=>till surface of  the water. Turning quickly they saw <
line 18801=>ripples, black -edged  with shadow in  the  waning  light: great  rings  were <
line 18802=>oint far out in the lake.  There  was  a bubbling  <
line 18803=>noise, and then silence.  The  dusk  deepened, and  the  last gleams of  the <
line 18804=>     Gandalf  now  pressed on  at  a great pace, and the  others followed as <
line 18805=>quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry  land between  the lake <
line 18806=>and the cliffs: it  was  narrow,  often  hardly  a  dozen yards  across, and <
line 18807=>n  rock  and stones; but they found a way, hugging the <
line 18808=>cliff,  and  keeping  as  far  from the  dark water as  they might.  A  mile <
line 18809=>southwardsre  they  came upon holly trees.  Stumps  and dead <
line 18810=>rotting  in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets,  <
line 18811=>ined the  road  across the drowned valley.  But <
line 18812=>close under the cliff  there  stood,  still strong and  living,  . two  tall <
line 18813=>0rees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo  had ever seen or imagined. <
line 18814=><
line 18815=>####-Their  great  roots spread  from the  wall to the  water. Under the   looming <
line 18816=>cliffs  they had looked like mere bushes, when seen  far off from the top of <
line 18817=>ow they  towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing <
line 18818=>deep night-shadows about their feet,  standing  like sentinel pillars at the <
line 18819=>   `Well, here  we are at last!  ' said  Gandalf. 'Here the Elven-way from <
line 18820=>Hollin ended. Holly  was  the  token  of the  people of that land, and  they <
line 18821=>planted it here to mark the end of their  domain; for the West -door was made <
line 18822=>in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those  were <
line 18823=>happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of <
line 18824=>n Dwarves and Elves.' <
line 18825=>     'It was not  the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship  waned,' said <
line 18826=>Gimli. <

line 18828=>     'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement  now. <

line 18872=>muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back. <
line 18873=>     'Look!' he said. `Can you see anything now?' <
line 18874=> upon the grey face of the  rock; but they could see <
line 18875=>nothing else for a  while.  Then slowly on the surface, where  the  wizard's <
line 18876=>s appeared, like slender veins of silver running <
line 18877=>in the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer -threads, so fine <

line 18965=>     The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at  the same instant there was <
line 18966=> rippling rings formed on the surface  out beyond  <
line 18967=>where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards  the  foot  of the <
line 18968=>cliff. <

line 18975=>despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was  heard <
line 18976=>. The ripples  on the water  grew and came  closer;  some were  already  <

line 18979=>the wizard sprang to his feet. `I have it! '  he  cried. 'Of  course, of  course! Absurdly <
line 18980=>simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.' <
line 18981=>     Picking up  his  staff he  stood before  the rock and  said  in  a clear <
line 18982=>voice: Mellon! <
line 18983=>     The  star  shone  out briefly  and faded again.  Then silently  a great <
line 18984=>doorway was  outlined, though not a  crack or joint had been visible before. <
line 18985=>Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch  by inch, until both  <
line 18986=>s lay back against the wall.  Through the opening a shadowy stair  could  <
line 18987=>ply up; but  beyond the  lower  steps the darkness  was <
line 18988=>deeper than the night. The Company stared in wonder. <
line 18989=>0 after all,' said  Gandalf, 'and Gimli  too. Merry, of  all <

line 18998=>and he fell with a cry. Bill  the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned <
line 18999=>d away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped  after  <
line 19000=>him, and  then hearing Frodo's cry  he ran back again, weeping  and cursing.  <
line 19001=>The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host  <
line 19002=>of snakes were swimming up from the southern end. <
line 19003=>  the  water  a  long sinuous  tentacle had  crawled;  it  was <
line 19004=>pale-green  and luminous and wet.  Its fingered end had ho ld of Frodo's foot  <

line 19009=>`Into  the gateway!  Up  the stairs!  Quick! ' shouted Gandalf  leaping <
line 19010=>back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to <
line 19011=>the ground where they stood, he drove them forward. <
line 19012=>þ in time. Sam and  Frodo were  only  a few steps up, and <
line 19013=>Gandalf had just  begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed  across <
line 19014=>the  nar fingered  the cliff-wall  and  the  doors. One came <
line 19015=>over  the  threshold, glistening in  the starlight. Gandalf turned <
line 19016=>dering what word would close the gate again from <

line 19024=> come with you.' <
line 19025=>     They heard Gandalf go back down  the steps and thrust his staff against <
line 19026=>the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the <
line 19027=>n. `Well, well! ' said the wizard. `The passage is blocked <

line 19055=>dim figures  in the gloom. After they had eaten,  Gandalf gave  them each  a  <

line 19069=>to  get the journey over as quickly  as possible, and were willing, tired as <
line 19070=>0ching  still for  several hours. Gandalf  walked in <
line 19071=>front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light <
line 19072=>nd before  his feet; in his right he  held  his <
line 19073=>sword Glamdring.  Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in  the dim light <
line 19074=>0s he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf  walked Frodo, and <
line 19075=>he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of  Sting <
line 19076=>  Glamdring;  and  that was some comfort, for being the work of  Elvish <
line 19077=>smiths in  the Elder  Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs <
line 19078=>were near  at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after  him  Legolas,  and the <
line 19079=> In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked <
line 19080=>Aragorn. <
line 19081=>     The passage  twisted  round a few  turns, and then began to descend. It <
line 19082=>went steadily down for  a long while before it became level once again.  The  <
line 19083=>ew  hot and  stifling, but  it was  not  foul, and at times they  felt <
line 19084=>pon  their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings <
line 19085=>in the walls.  There  were  many of  these. In the  pale ray of the wizard's <
line 19086=> of stairs and arches and of  other passages and <
line 19087=>tunnels, sloping  up,  or  running steeply down, or opening  blankly dark on <
line 19088=>either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering. <
line 19089=>     Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by h is stout  courage. At least  <
line 19090=>he  was not,  as  were most of the  others, troubled by the mere darkness in <
line 19091=>itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was <
line 19092=>lways  Gandalf who had the final word. The  Mines  of <
line 19093=>Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination  of Gimli, Gluin's son,  <
line 19094=>dwarf of t though he was. To Gandalf the far -off memories of <
line 19095=>long  before were now of little help, but  even  in the gloom and <
line 19096=>oad he knew whither he wished to go, and he did <
line 19097=>not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal. <
line 19098=>t be afraid! ' said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, <
line 19099=>and Gandalf and Gimli were  whispering  together; the  others  were  crowded <
line 19100=> anxiously. `Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a  <
line 19101=>journey,  if  never on  one so dark; and  there  are tales  of  Rivendell of <

line 19108=>many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have <
line 19109=>come  to grief. There  were not only  many roads  to choose from, there were <
line 19110=>also  in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside  the  path in <
line 19111=>0echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls <
line 19112=>and floor, and  every  now  and  then  a crack would open right before their <
line 19113=>feet.  The wian seven  feet across, and it  was long  before <
line 19114=>mmon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap.  The noise <
line 19115=>of churning water came  up from  far below, as if  some great mill-wheel was <

line 19125=>. His senses were sharper and more aware  of things that could <
line 19126=>not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed  was that he  could <
line 19127=>ark  than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And <
line 19128=>he was  in any case  the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain  against <

line 19147=>passages: all  led  in  the  same  general  direction,  eastwards;  but  the <
line 19148=>down, while the right-hand climbed up,  and  the  <
line 19149=>middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow. <
line 19150=>     'I  have no  memory of this  place  at all! '  said  Gandalf,  standing <
line 19151=>held up his staff in the hope of finding some <
line 19152=>ff in the hope of finding some ion that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was <
line 19153=>to be seen. `I am too  weary to decide,'  he said, shaking his head. `And  I <
line 19154=>expect  that you are all as weary  as I  am, or wearier.  We had better halt <
line 19155=>here for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever  <

line 19159=>haven't got him yet.' <
line 19160=>reat arch  they  found a stone door:  it was half <
line 19161=>closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie <
line 19162=> <
line 19163=>     `Steady! Steady!  ' cried  Gandalf as Merry and  Pippin pushed forward, <
line 19164=>lace where  they could  rest  with  at least more feeling of <
line 19165=>shelter than  in  the open passage. `Steady! You do  not know what is inside  <
line 19166=>t.' <
line 19167=>     He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. `There! '  he said, <
line 19168=>pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw <
line 19169=>uth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at <

line 19171=>     'One of you might have fallen in and  still be wondering  when you were <

line 19173=>while you have one.' <
line 19174=>to  have been a guardroom, made for  the  watching  of the <
line 19175=>e passages,'  said Gimli. `That hole was plainly a  well for the guards' <

line 19177=><
line 19178=>####-care in the dark.' <
line 19179=>     Pippin  felt  curiously attracted by  the  well. While the  others were <
line 19180=>unrolling  blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far  <
line 19181=>as  possible from the hole in  the floor, he crept  to the  edge  and peered <
line 19182=>over. A chill air seemed to  strike his face,  rising from invisible depths. <
line 19183=>pulse he groped for a loose  stone, and let it drop. He <
line 19184=>felt  his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then  far below,  <

line 19188=>what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see  his  eye glinting.  <
line 19189=>'Fool  of a Took!  '  he growled. 'This  is a serious journey,  not a hobbit <
line 19190=>walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and  then you will be no further  <
line 19191=>sance. Now be quiet! ' <
line 19192=>     Nothing more was heard for several  minutes; but then there came out of <
line 19193=>om-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and when the echoes <
line 19194=>had  died away, they  were repeated:  tap-tom,  tom-tap, tap-tap, tom.  They  <
line 19195=>signals of  some  sort;  but after a  while the <
line 19196=>knocking died away and was not heard again. <
line 19197=> heard again.    'That  was  the  sound of a  hammer, or I have never heard  one,'  said <

line 19201=>Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can <
line 19202=>go on the first watch, as a  reward,' he growled, as he  rolled himself in a  <
line 19203=>blanket.  <
line 19204=>0ly  by  the door in  the pitch dark; but he kept on <
line 19205=>und, fearing  that some unknown thing would  crawl  up out of the <
line 19206=>ver  the  hole,  if only with a blanket, but he <
line 19207=>dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep. <
line 19208=>tually Gandalf was awake, though  lying still and silent. He was deep <
line 19209=>in  thought,  trying  to recall  every memory of  his former journey in  the <
line 19210=> considering  anxiously  the next  course  that he should take; a  <
line 19211=>false turn now might be disastrous.  After an hour  he rose up and came over  <
line 19212=>to Pippin. <
line 19213=>     `Get into a corner  and have a sleep, my lad,' he said in a kindly tone. <
line 19214=> sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so  I may  as well do the <
line 19215=>watching.' <
line 19216=>     'I know what is the matter with me,' he muttered, as he sat down by the <
line 19217=>door.  'I  need  smoke!  I have not tasted  it since the morning  before the <
line 19218=>snowstorm.' <
line 19219=>     The  last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took  him, was a dark glimpse <
line 19220=>d on  the floor,  shielding a glowing chip in his <
line 19221=>gnarled hands  between his knees.  The flicker for  a moment showed his sharp <
line 19222=>nose. and the      It was  Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He  had sat and watched <
line 19223=>ut six hours, and had let  the others  rest.  `And  in the <
line 19224=>watches I have  made up my mind,' he  said. `I  do  not  like the feel of the <
line 19225=>middle way; and  I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul <
line 19226=>air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right -hand passage. It is <

line 19228=>     For eight dark hours, not counting two brief  halts,  they marched  on;  <

line 19243=>all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls <
line 19244=>to  right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some  arched <
line 19245=>y space. There  was  a great draught of  warmer  <
line 19246=>air behind them, and before  them the darkness was cold on their faces. They <

line 19252=>Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide <

line 19254=>     He  raised his staff,  and for a  brief instant there was blaze  like a  <
line 19255=>adows sprang up and fled, and for a second they  <
line 19256=>saw a vast roof  far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of <
line 19257=>stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black  <
line 19258=>walls, polished  and smooth  as  glass, flashed and glittered.  Three  other  <
line 19259=>trances  they saw, dark black  arches: one straight before them eastwards,  <
line 19260=>and one on either side. Then the light went out. <

line 19263=>to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached  them <

line 19265=>am right, tomorrow we may  actually see  the morning peeping  in. But in the <
line 19266=>  no further. Let  us rest, if we can. Things have <
line 19267=>gone well  so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are <

line 19269=>e Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close <
line 19270=>0 escape  the draught:  there seemed  to be a steady <
line 19271=>inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as  they lay <
line 19272=>hung the darkd  immense,  and  they  were  oppressed by  the <
line 19273=>vastness of  the dolven halls and endlessly branching  stairs <
line 19274=>and passages. The wildest imaginings  that dark rumour had ever suggested to <
line 19275=>together short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria. <
line 19276=>     `There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time ' said <

line 19282=>splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.' <

line 19367=>e Shire and everything in it.'  put his hand under his tunic and touched the <
line 19368=>0-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking <
line 19369=>about with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt <
line 19370=>new quite  well.  It was indeed a kingly gift. But  now <
line 19371=>his thoughts  had been carried away  from the dark  Mines, to  Rivendell, to <
line 19372=>0n  the days while Bilbo was  still there. He wished <
line 19373=>with  all his  heart  that he was back  there, and in those days, mowing the  <

line 19377=>guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors  out of deep <
line 19378=> over him. His hands were cold  and his  brow  damp. He <
line 19379=>listened. All his mind was given to listening and  nothing else for two slow <

line 19381=>     His  watch  was nearly over, when, far  off  where he guessed  that the <
line 19382=>western  archway stood,  he  fancied  that he could  see two pale points  of <
line 19383=> luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. `I must  <

line 19391=>eastern  archway through a shaft near  the roof came  a long pale gleam; and <
line 19392=>across the hall  through  the  northern  arch light also glimmered faint and <
line 19393=><
line 19394=>####-distantly. <
line 19395=>ood morning!  ' said  Gandalf: `For morning it is again <
line 19396=>at last. I was right,  you see.  We  are high up on the east  side of Moria. <

line 19402=>     After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at  once. `We <

line 19413=> light comes only down deep shafts.' <
line 19414=> comes only down deep shafts.' the Company  passed under the  northern arch. They <
line 19415=>found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the  glimmer grew <
line 19416=>stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was <
line 19417=>high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing <
line 19418=>half open.  Beyond it was a large square  chamber. It was  dimly lit, but to <
line 19419=> long  a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly  bright, <
line 19420=>and they blinked as they entered. <
line 19421=>red.   Their  feet  disturbed  a deep dust upon the floor,  and stumbled among <
line 19422=>thingdoorway whose shapes they could not at first  make out. <
line 19423=>The chamber was lit  by a  wi de shaft high in the  further  eastern wall; it <
line 19424=>slanted  upwards and, far  above,  a small square patch of blue sky could be <
line 19425=>seen. The light of the  shaft fell directly  on a table in the middle of the <
line 19426=>k, about two  feet high,  upon  which was laid a  <
line 19427=>great slab of white stone. <
line 19428=>     `It  looks  like  a tomb,' muttered  Frodo,  and  bent forwards with  a  <
line 19429=>rious  sense  of foreboding,  to  look more  closely  at it.  Gandalf came <
line 19430=> On the slab runes were deeply graven: <

line 19434=>     lord of moria.' <
line 19435=>   then,' said  Frodo. `I feared it was  so.' Gimli cast his <

line 19437=>er 5. The Bridge of Khazad-dym <
line 19438=><
line 19439=>ng stood silent beside the  tomb of  Balin. Frodo <
line 19440=>thought  of  Bilbo  and his long friendship with the  dwarf,  and of Balin's <

line 19447=>broken swords and axe-heads,  and cloven  shields and <
line 19448=>helms. Some of the swords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.  <
line 19449=>ses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were <
line 19450=>large iron-bound chests  of  wood. All had  been  broken and plundered;  but <
line 19451=>beside the shae there lay the remains of a book. It had been <
line 19452=>bbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and <

line 19559=>door and thrust forward his staff:  There was a dazzling flash that  lit the <
line 19560=>sage  outside. For an instant  the wizard  looked  out. <
line 19561=>Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back. <
line 19562=>     'There are  Orcs, very many of them,' he said. `And some are  large and <

line 19575=>     Heavy feet  were  heard in the corridor. Boromir  flung himself against  <
line 19576=>the door  and heaved it to; then  he wedged it  with broken sword-blades and <

line 19600=>     How many there were the Company could  not count. The affray was sharp, <

line 19615=>clustered in the doorway. His broad flat  face was swart, his eyes were like <

line 19750=>     Even as he  spoke they heard again  the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, <

line 19758=>echo  of  many  hurrying feet behind.  A shrill  yell went up: they had been <

line 19760=>head. <
line 19761=>     Boromir laughed. `They did not expect this,' he said. `The fire has cut <

line 19776=>pierced Gandalf's hat  and stuck there  like a black feather.  Frodo  looked <
line 19777=>behind. Beyond  the fire  he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to  be <
line 19778=>hundreds of orcs. They brandished spears and scimitars which  shone  red  as <

line 19810=>Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side,  <

line 19851=>or staring  into the pit. Even  as Aragorn and Boromir came flying <
line 19852=>back, the rest  of the bridge cracked and  fell.  With a  cry Aragorn roused <
line 19853=>them. <
line 19854=>     'Come!  I  will lead you now!  '  he  called.  'We  must  obey his last  <

line 19862=>They passed into  a  hall, bright with daylight from  its <
line 19863=>high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors <

line 19866=>of  orcs crouching in the  shadows behind the  great <
line 19867=>door posts towering on either  side,  but the gates were shattered and  cast <
line 19868=>down.  Aragorn smote to the ground the  captain that stood  in his path, and <

line 19877=> Dark yawned  the  archway  of  the Gates  under the <
line 19878=>mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats:  <

line 19900=>     `Or Caradhras less cruel,' said Gimli. `There he stands smiling in  the <

line 19906=>little below them, for they still stood high up on  the <
line 19907=>west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a  <
line 19908=> deep  into the northern glen; but its  southern end <
line 19909=>was  beyond the  shadows under the sunlit sky. Yet  its  waters were dark: a  <
line 19910=>ing sky seen from  a lamp-lit room. Its face  was <
line 19911=>still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides <
line 19912=> `There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled -zvram! ' said  Gimli sadly.  `I  <
line 19913=>remember that he said: "May you have joy of  the sight! But we cannot linger <

line 19916=>     The  Company now went down  the road from the Gates.  It was  rough and <

line 19981=>     'I am sorry,  Frodo!  ' he cried, full of concern. `So much has happened <

line 20032=>the  food ready.  Aragorn  bathed the hurts  with wa ter in which athelas was <
line 20033=>steeped. The pungent fragrance filled  the dell, and all  those who  stooped <
line 20034=>refreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the <

line 20041=>     When they  had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They  put out the  <

line 20043=>in.  They  had  not  gone far before the sun  sank  behind the <
line 20044=>westward  heights  and  great  shadows crept down  the mountain-sides.  Dusk  <

line 20051=>the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound  upon the <
line 20052=>road behind. At length Gimli broke the silence. <
line 20053=>     'Not a sound but the wind,' he  said. `There are no goblins near, or my <

line 20057=>for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.' <
line 20058=>  Frodo  did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade  was dull. Yet <
line 20059=>he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon a s the shadows had fallen <
line 20060=>about them and the  road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter <
line 20061=>of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams <
line 20062=>of light behind, or for a moment he thought he  saw  them, but at once  they <
line 20063=>shed. <
line 20064=>     `What is it? ' said the dwarf.  <
line 20065=> it? ' said the dwarf.  ' answered Frodo. 'I thought I heard feet,  and I thought <

line 20073=>     `Lothlurien! ' cried Legolas. 'Lothlurien! We have come to the eaves of <

line 20078=>of fallow gold. <

line 20089=>     'Indeed deep  in the  wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, and sighed as  if <

line 20102=>     `Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak <

line 20111=>     They  had gone  little more than a mile into the  forest when they came <
line 20112=>g  down swiftly from  the tree-clad  slopes that <
line 20113=>climbed back westward towards the mountains.  They heard it splashing over a  <
line 20114=> their  right. Its dark  hurrying waters  ran <
line 20115=>Its dark  hurrying waters  ran efore  them, and joined  the Silverlode in a  swirl  of dim <

line 20124=>the  further bank we can rest. and  the sound of the falling water may bring <

line 20126=>     One by one they  climbed down and followed Legolas. For  a moment Frodo <
line 20127=>stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet. It was cold <
line 20128=>but its touch was clean, and  as he went on and it  mounted to his knees, he <
line 20129=>felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs.  <
line 20130=>mpany had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little <
line 20131=>food; and Legolas  told them  tales of Lothlurien that the Elves of Mirkwood  <

line 20135=>nce fell, and they  heard the music of the waterfall <
line 20136=>running sweetly  in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he  could  hear a <
line 20137=>the sound of the water. <
line 20138=>     `Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel? ' asked Legolas. 'I will sing you a  <
line 20139=>song  of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same  name  as the stream  besi de <
line 20140=>0 lived lung ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this <
line 20141=>is how it runs in the  Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.' In <
line 20142=>hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them  he <
line 20143=>began: <

line 20203=>     `I said not  so; yet evil came,' answered Legolas sadly.  `Then many of <

line 20219=>ter days dwelling in the trees might  be thought <

line 20221=>to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then up into the roof of dark <
line 20222=>boughs above. <
line 20223=>     `Your  words bring good counsel, Gimli,' said Aragorn. `We cannot build <
line 20224=>a house, but  tonight we  will do as the Galadhrim  and seek  refuge  in the <
line 20225=>ps, if we can. We have sat here beside  the road  already longer than <
line 20226=>was wise.' <
line 20227=>     The Company now turned aside from the path, and  went into the shadow of <
line 20228=>the deeper woods,  westward along  the mountain-stream away from <
line 20229=>Silverlode. <
line 20230=>Not  far from the falls of Nimrodel they  found a cluster of trees,  some of <
line 20231=>0hich overhung the stream. Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but <
line 20232=>not be guessed. <
line 20233=>     `I will climb up,' said  Legolas. `I am at home among trees, by root or  <
line 20234=>bough, though  these  trees are of a kind strange to  me, save as  a name in <
line 20235=>rn  they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, <

line 20243=>that grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for <
line 20244=>a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him. <

line 20247=> against the bole of the tree. l! ' he whispered to the others. `Do not move or speak! ' <
line 20248=>     There  was a sound  of soft laughter over their heads, and then another  <
line 20249=>clear voice spoke in an  elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what <
line 20250=>was  said, for the speech that the  Silvan folk east of the  mountains  used <
line 20251=>e that of the West. Legolas looked up and <
line 20252=>he West. Legolas looked up and  language.* <
line 20253=>las looked up and  language.*  and what do they say? ' asked Merry. <
line 20254=>     `They're Elves,' said Sam. `Can't  you hear their voices? ' <
line 20255=>es,'  said Legolas; `and they say that you breathe so <
line 20256=>loud that they could  shoot you in the dark.' Sam  hastily put his hand over <
line 20257=>lso that  you need have  no fear. They have  been <
line 20258=>or a long while. They heard  my  voice across the Nimrodel, and <
line 20259=>Northern kindred, and therefore they did  not <
line 20260=>d, and therefore they did  not ing; and  afterwards  they  heard  my song. Now they bid me <
line 20261=>climb up  with Frodo;  for they seem  to have had some tidings of him and of <
line 20262=>our journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep  watch at  the <
line 20263=> the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.' <
line 20264=>     Out of  the  shadows a  ladder  was  let  down:  it  was made  of rope, <
line 20265=>silver -grey and  glimmering  in the dark, and  though it looked  slender  it <
line 20266=>rong enough to bear  many men. Legolas ran  lightly up, and  Frodo <
line 20267=>e Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches <
line 20268=>of the mallorn-tree grew  out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept <
line 20269=>upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown  of many boughs,  <
line 20270=>0these they  found that there had been built a wooden platform, or <
line 20271=>flet as such things were called in those days: the  Elves called it a talan. <

line 20273=>passed. <
line 20274=> last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated  with <

line 20276=>ss they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of <
line 20277=>them uncovered a small lamp that  gave out a slender silver beam. He held it <
line 20278=>and Sam's. Then he shut  off the light again, <
line 20279=> he shut  off the light again, of welcome in  his elven-tongue.  Frodo  spoke haltingly in <
line 20280=>return. <
line 20281=>     `Welcome!' the Elf then said  again in the  Common  Language,  speaking <

line 20295=>     `Eight,' said Legolas. `Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom, <

line 20297=>     `The  name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lurien,' said Haldir, <
line 20298=>`and  he  has the favour of  the  Lady. All then is  well.  But you have yet <

line 20308=>their own tongue. 'Very good,' said Haldir at last. `We will do this, though <
line 20309=>it is against our liking. If  Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer  <
line 20310=>all pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlurien. <
line 20311=>     `But now  we must debate  no  longer. Your folk  must not remain on the <

line 20632=>     Frodo looked  and saw, still at some  distance, a  hill of many  mighty <
line 20633=>trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it, <

line 20637=>he looked  eastward and  saw all the land of Lurien running down to  the pale  <
line 20638=>0leam of Anduin, the Great  River.  He lifted his  eyes across the river and <
line 20639=>out, and he  was back again in the world he knew.  Beyond <
line 20640=>the river  the land  appeared flat and empty,  formless and vague, until far <
line 20641=>like  a  wall, dark  and drear.  The sun that lay  on <
line 20642=>Lothlurien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height. <
line 20643=>     `There  lies  the fastness of  Southern  Mirkwood,' said Haldir. `It is <
line 20644=>clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and <

line 20656=>and as Frodo looked  at him he eld things as they once had been in this same place. For the <

line 20659=>to one whom Frodo could not see . Arwen vanimelda, nambril! he said, and then <

line 20673=>running in a  great circle  and bending  away on  either  <
line 20674=>hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its <
line 20675=>it  glowed still in memory of the sun that  had gone. <
line 20676=>Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a  <

line 20685=>0the  southern side,  and the  way is  not  short,  for the city  is <
line 20686=>great.' <
line 20687=>     There was a road  paved with white stone  running on the outer brink of <
line 20688=>the  fosse. Along this  they wen t westward, with the city  ever  climbing up <
line 20689=>like  a  green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened  more lights <
line 20690=>forth, until all the  hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last <

line 20697=>passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could <

line 20701=>     They went along many paths and climbed many  stairs, until they came to <
line 20702=>igh places and saw before them amid a wide  lawn a fountain shimmering. <
line 20703=>It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees,  and it fell <
line 20704=>into a  basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled.  Upon the  south <

line 20709=>seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they <

line 20711=>cloaks. <

line 20720=>et about  the  bole of the tree,  so that the ladder  <
line 20721=>passed through them. At a  great height above the ground he came to  a  wide <
line 20722=>reat ship. On it was built a house, so large that <
line 20723=>almost  it would have served  for  a hall of Men upon the earth. He  entered <
line 20724=>he was  in a chamber of oval  shape,  in  the <
line 20725=>amber of oval  shape,  in  the ew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its <
line 20726=>crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth. <
line 20727=>     The chamber was  filled with a  soft  light; its walls were  green  and <
line 20728=>silver and  its roof  of gold. Many Elves were  seated there.  On two chairs <
line 20729=>beneath the  bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side <
line 20730=>by side, Celeborn and Galadriel.  They stood up to greet  their guests, after  <
line 20731=>s, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall <
line 20732=>they were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave  and <

line 20739=>     Haldir led  Frodo  before them, and the  Lord welcomed  him in his  own <
line 20740=>tongue. The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face. <

line 20753=>  When all  the guests were seated before his chair   the  Lord  looked at <
line 20754=>them again. 'Here there  are eight,' he said. `Nine were to set out: so said <
line 20755=>ssages. But maybe  there has been some  change of counsel that we have <
line 20756=>not heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this <

line 20758=>longer.'  `Nay, there was no change of counsel,' said the Lady Galadriel speaking <

line 20776=>     `Yet our grief  is  great  and our loss  cannot be mended ,' said Frodo. <

line 20807=>names given in his own ancient tongue,  looked up and met her  eyes;  and it <
line 20808=>seemed  to him that he looked  suddenly  into the heart of  an enemy and saw <

line 21042=>for  the stars went out. As if  a dark  veil had  been withdrawn, the Mirror  <
line 21043=> clear. There was sun shining, and the branches  of trees <
line 21044=>were waving and tossing in the  wind. But before Sam could make  up his mind <
line 21045=>w, the  light faded; and  now he thought he saw Frodo <
line 21046=>with  a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed <
line 21047=>to see  him  a dim passage, and climbing an endless  winding <

line 21053=>0Sam  in  an  outraged  voice.  'There's  that Ted  Sandyman <

line 21057=>     But  now  Sam  noticed  that the Old  Mill had  vanished,  and  a large <
line 21058=> being put up  where it had stood. Lots of  folk  were <
line 21059=>busily  at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby.  Black smoke seemed to <

line 21061=>     'There's some devilry at work in the Shire,' he said. 'Elrond knew what <

line 21074=>.'     Sam  sat on  the  ground and  put his head in his hands. `I  wish I had <
line 21075=>never come  here, and I don't want to see  no  more magic,' he said and fell <
line 21076=>silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with  tears. <

line 21083=>     'No,' she said. `I do not counsel you one way or the other. I am  not a  <

line 21088=>     `I will look,' said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over  <
line 21089=>the  dark  water.  At once the Mirror  cleared  and  he  saw  a twilit land. <
line 21090=>Mountains  loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A  long grey road <
line 21091=>r away a figure came slowly down the road, faint <
line 21092=>and  small at  first,  but  growing  larger and  clearer  as it  approached. <
line 21093=>Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded  him  of Gandalf. He  almost called <
line 21094=>aloud the wizard's name, and then he saw that  the figure was clothed not in <
line 21095=>grey but in  white, in  a white  that shone faintly in the dusk; and  in its <
line 21096=>te staff. The  head was so bowed that he could see  no <
line 21097=>face,  and  presently the figure turned aside round  a bend in the road  and <
line 21098=>went out    view. Doubt came into Frodo's  mind:  was this a  <
line 21099=>andalf on one of his  many  lonely  journeys long  ago, or was it <
line 21100=>w  changed. Brief and  small but  very vivid  he  caught a  <
line 21101=>glimpse of  Bilbo  walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered <

line 21104=>Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become <
line 21105=>0d and he saw a sight which he had never seen before <
line 21106=>but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose  and raged in a great <
line 21107=>storm. Then   the  Sun, sinking  blood-red into a  wrack  of <
line 21108=>ack outline  of a tall ship with torn sails riding up  out of <
line 21109=>the  West.  Then a wide river flowing through a  populous city. Then a white  <
line 21110=>n towers. And then again a ship with  black sails, but now <
line 21111=>it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing  <
line 21112=>lþe tree shone in the sun. A smoke  as of fire and battle <
line 21113=>arose, and again the  sun went  down in a burning red that faded into a grey <
line 21114=>mist; and small  ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It <

line 21116=>hed and prepared to draw away. e Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as  if a hole had <
line 21117=>opened in the world  of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black  <
line 21118=>abyss there appeared a single Eye  that slowly grew. until it  filled nearly <
line 21119=>all  the  Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to  cry <
line 21120=>ze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but  was itself <
line 21121=>glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful  and  intent, and  the black slit of its <
line 21122=> into nothing. <
line 21123=>e began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew <
line 21124=>th certainty  and  horror that  among  the  many things that it sought  he <
line 21125=>himself  was one. But  he also knew that  it could not see him-not yet,  not <
line 21126=> he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its  chain  about his neck grew <
line 21127=>eat stone,  and his  head was dragged downwards. The <
line 21128=>Mirror  seemed  to be growing hot and  curls  of steam were rising  from the <
line 21129=>rd. <
line 21130=>     `Do not touch the water!' said the  Lady  Galadriel softly. The  vision <
line 21131=>faded,  and Frodo found that he was  looking  at the cool stars twinkling in <

line 21136=>Lothlurien maintained and defended against its  Enemy. I say  to you, Frodo, <

line 21141=>     She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East <
line 21142=>in a  gesture of  rejection  and  denial. Edrendil, the Evening  Star,  most  <
line 21143=>beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of <
line 21144=>the Elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring <
line 21145=>t  glittered like  polished  gold overlaid  with silver <
line 21146=>light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Even -star had come down to <

line 21168=>     'You are wise  and fearless  and fair, Lady  Galadriel,' said Frodo. `I  <

line 21170=>me.' <
line 21171=>     Galadriel laughed  with a sudden clear laugh. `Wise the  Lady Galadriel <
line 21172=>may be,' she said, `yet here she has met her match in  courtesy. Gently  are <

line 21177=>p. The evil that was devised long ago  works on  in many  ways,  whether <
line 21178=>or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set  <

line 21197=>he tides of fate are flowing.'   one thing before we go,'  said Frodo, `a  thing which I <

line 21285=>to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go  first to Minas <

line 21289=>his mind. <
line 21290=><
line 21291=>####-     His  own  plan, while Gandalf remained with  them, had been to go  with <
line 21292=>Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the <
line 21293=>message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last <
line 21294=>0il  should  come  forth and  strive with  Sauron  for the <
line 21295=>mastery. But in Moria  the burden of Gandalf had been laid  on  him; and  he  <
line 21296=>knew t now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in  the end to  <
line 21297=>  Boromir. And  yet what help could he or any of the Company give  to <
line 21298=>0ly with him into the darkness?  <
line 21299=>ly with him into the darkness?  h,  alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said <
line 21300=>Boromir; and after  that he was  silent  for a while,  sitting with his eyes <
line 21301=>fixed  on Frodo, as if  he was trying  to  read the Halfling's thoughts.  At <
line 21302=>in, softly, as if he was debating  with himself. `If you  <
line 21303=>wish only to destroy  the Ring,' he said,  `then there is little use in  war <
line 21304=>n of Minas  Tirith  cannot  help.  But if you wish to  <
line 21305=>destroy the armed might  of the  Dark Lord,  then it is folly  to go without <
line 21306=> folly  to throw away.' He  paused suddenly, as if <
line 21307=>he had  become aware that he was  speaking his thoughts aloud. `It  would be <
line 21308=>folly  to  thr I  mean,' he ended. `It is  a choice  between <
line 21309=>ong place  and   walking openly  into the arms  of death.  At  <
line 21310=>least, that is how I see it.' <
line 21311=>     Frodo caught something  new  and strange  in  Boromir's glance, and  he <
line 21312=>.  Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final <
line 21313=>words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said <
line 21314=> the Council, but then he had accepted the correction <
line 21315=>of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn,  but he seemed  deep in  his own thought <
line 21316=>ad  heeded Boromir's wor ds.  And so  their debate <
line 21317=>ended. Merry and Pippin were  already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The <
line 21318=>t <
line 21319=>was growing old. <
line 21320=>     In the  morning, as they were  beginning  to  pack their slender goods,  <
line 21321=>Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts <
line 21322=>othing for the  journey.  The food was  mostly in the  form of <
line 21323=>very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, <
line 21324=>he colour of  cream. Gimli took  up one  of  the cakes and <
line 21325=>looked at it with a doubtful eye. <
line 21326=>e.     `Cram,' he said  under his breath,  as he broke off a crisp corner  and <
line 21327=>. His expression quickly changed, and  he ate  all the rest  of <
line 21328=>the cake with relish. <
line 21329=>     `No more,  no  more!' cried the  Elves laughing.  `You have eaten enough <
line 21330=>already for a long day's march.' <
line 21331=>or a long day's march.'   only a kind of cram, such as  the Dale-men make for <
line 21332=>journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf.  <
line 21333=>Dwarf.       `So it is,' they answered.  `But we call it   lembas or waybread, and it <
line 21334=>0ening than any food made  by Men, and  it  is more  pleasant  <
line 21335=>than cram, by all accounts.' <
line 21336=>     `Indeed it is,' said Gimli.  'Why it is better than  the honey-cakes of <
line 21337=>the Beornings,  and  that  is great praise,  for the Beornings  are the best <
line 21338=>bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes <
line 21339=>0ys. You are kindly hosts! ' <
line 21340=>     'All the same, we bid you spare the food,' they  said. 'Eat little at a  <
line 21341=>eed. For these things  are given to  serve  you when all  <
line 21342=>else fails.  The  cakes  will keep sweet  for  many many  days, if  they are <
line 21343=>eir leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will <
line 21344=>keep a traveller on his feet for a day of  long labour, even if he be one of <
line 21345=>the tall Meh.' <
line 21346=>ped  and gave to each  of the Company the clothes <

line 21351=>, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow <
line 21352=>fields by  night, dusk -silver  as  water under  the  stars. Each  cloak  was <
line 21353=> with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver. <
line 21354=>     `Are these magic cloaks? ' asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder. <
line 21355=> mean by  that,' answered  the  leader  of the <
line 21356=> answered  the  leader  of the  fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this <
line 21357=>land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what  you  mean. Leaf  and  <
line 21358=>branch, water and  stone: they have the hue and beauty  of all  these things <
line 21359=>under the twilight of Lurien that we  love; for  we  put the thought of  all <
line 21360=>hat  we make. Yet they  are garments, not armour, and <
line 21361=>they  will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are <
line 21362=>light to weugh  or cool enough at  need.  And  you will find <
line 21363=>aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you  <

line 21365=>Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have <

line 21367=>     After  their morning meal the Company said farewell to  the lawn by the <
line 21368=>ere  heavy;  for it was a fair  place, and it had <
line 21369=>become like home to  them,  though they could not count the days and  nights <

line 21384=>white  bridge; and so they  passed out and left the city of the Elves.  Then <
line 21385=>they turned  away from the paved road  and took  a path that went off into a  <
line 21386=>deep  thicket  of  mallorn-trees,  and passed  on,  winding through  rolling <
line 21387=>er  shadow,  leading   them  ever  down,  southwards  and <
line 21388=>eastwards, towards the shores of the River. <
line 21389=>s, towards the shores of the River.  ten miles and noon  was at hand when they came on a  <
line 21390=>high green  wall. Passing through  an opening they came  suddenly out of the <
line 21391=>trees. Before them  lay a  long  lawn of shining grass, studded  with golden <
line 21392=> glinted  in the sun.  The lawn ran  out  into a narrow  tongue <
line 21393=>between  bright margins:  on  the  right  and  west  the  Silverlode  flowed <
line 21394=>glittering; on the left and  east the Great River  rolled its broad  waters, <
line 21395=>deep and  dark.  On  the  further  shores the  woodlands  still  marched  on <
line 21396=>the eye could see, but  all the banks  were  bleak  and <
line 21397=>bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lurien. <
line 21398=>rlode, at some distance up from the meeting of <
line 21399=>istance up from the meeting of here was a hythe of white stones and  white wood. By it were <
line 21400=>moored many boats and  barges.  Some were  brightly painted, and shone  with <
line 21401=>d  and green, but most were either  white or grey. Three small <
line 21402=>grey boats had been made ready for  the travellers, and  in  these the Elves <
line 21403=>. And they added  also coils of rope, three  to each boat. <
line 21404=>Slender they looked, but strong,  silken  to the touch, grey of hue like the <

line 21410=> many needs.' on't  need to  tell me  that! ' said Sam. `I came without any and <
line 21411=> But I was wondering  what these  were made of,  <

line 21413=>`They are made of hithlain ,' said the Elf, `but there is no time now to <

line 21415=>ed  you, we  could  have taught  you  much. But  now alas! unless you <
line 21416=>0n hither, you must be content with our gift. May it <
line 21417=>serve you well! ' <
line 21418=>r.  `All is now ready  for you. Enter the boats! But <
line 21419=>take care at first! ' <
line 21420=>s! ' said the other  Elves. 'These boats are light-built, <
line 21421=>and they are crafty and  unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink, <
line 21422=>lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be  wise <
line 21423=>0customed yourselves to stepping  in and out,  here where there is a  <
line 21424=>landing-place, before you set off downstream.' <
line 21425=>you set off downstream.' ompany  was  arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in <
line 21426=>and Pippin  in another; and  in the  third  were <
line 21427=>Legolas and Gimli, who  had now become fast friends. In this last boat  most <
line 21428=>of  the goods and packs were  stowed. The boats were moved and  steered with <
line 21429=>short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all  was ready <
line 21430=>Aragorn led them  on a trial up  the Silverlode. The current  was  swift and <
line 21431=>wly. Sam sat  in the  bows,  clutching the  sides, and <
line 21432=>looking back wistfully to  the  shore. The sunlight  glittering on the water  <
line 21433=>dazzled hy passed beyond the green field of the Tongue,  the <
line 21434=> down to the  river's  brink. Here and there golden lea ves tossed <
line 21435=> stream.  The air was very bright and still, and <
line 21436=>there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks. <
line 21437=>ey turned a sharp bend in  the river, and there, sailing proudly down <
line 21438=>the stream toward them, they saw a  swan of great size. The water rippled on  <
line 21439=>de of the white  breast beneath its curving neck. Its  beak  shone <
line 21440=>like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its <
line 21441=>huge white wings  were half lifted.  A music came down the river as it  drew <
line 21442=>nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was  a ship, wrought  and carved <
line 21443=>n the likeness of  a bird. Two elves clad in white steered <
line 21444=>it  with  black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind <
line 21445=>Ælþtall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her  <
line 21446=>hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and  she sang. Sad and  sweet was the <
line 21447=>sound of  cool clear air: <
line 21448=>     I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold  there grew:  <
line 21449=>     Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.  <
line 21450=>     Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea, <
line 21451=>     And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree. <
line 21452=>     Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone, <
line 21453=>     In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion. <
line 21454=>lden leaves have grown upon the branching years, <
line 21455=>e beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears. <
line 21456=>     O Lurien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day; <
line 21457=>     The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away. <
line 21458=>     O Lurien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore <
line 21459=>     And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor. <
line 21460=>ps I now should sing, what ship would come to me, <
line 21461=>     What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea? <
line 21462=>ayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended <
line 21463=>her  song and greeted them. `We have come to bid you our last farewell,' she <
line 21464=> you with blessings from our land . ' <
line 21465=>th blessings from our land . ' een our guests,'  said Celeborn, `you have  not yet <
line 21466=>eaten with  us, and we  bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between <
line 21467=>bear you far from Lurien.' <
line 21468=>     The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and <
line 21469=>followed it. There in the last  end  of  Egladil  upon  the  green grass the <
line 21470=>parting feast was held;  but Frodo ate  and drank  little,  heeding only the <
line 21471=> voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible,  <
line 21472=>nor  filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later <
line 21473=>e seen: present and yet remote, a living vision <
line 21474=><
line 21475=>####-of that  which has already been left far behind by  the  flowing  streams of <
line 21476=>Time. <
line 21477=>     After they had eaten and drunk,  sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke <
line 21478=>to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the <
line 21479=> <
line 21480=>     `As you go down the water,' he said, `you will find that the trees will <
line 21481=>ill come to a barren country. There the River flows in stony <
line 21482=>vale amid  high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall <
line 21483=>ock,  that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its  arms <
line 21484=>about the steep shores of the  isle, and falls then  with a  great noise and <

line 21589=>     The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at <
line 21590=>the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. 'It is said that the  skill of the <
line 21591=>ds rather than in their tongues ' she said; `yet that <
line 21592=>is not true of Gimli. For  none have ever  made to me a request  so bold and <

line 21594=>what would you do with such a gift? ' <
line 21595=>uld you do with such a gift? '  he answered, `in memory of your words to me at our <

line 21607=> prepared  this.'  She held up phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light <
line 21608=>sprang from  her hand.  'In this  phial,' she said, `is  caught the light of <

line 21622=>d her they  turned and their eyes watched her  <
line 21623=>ed and their eyes watched her   away  from  them.  For  so it seemed  to  them:  Lurien was <
line 21624=>slipping  backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees,  sailing <
line 21625=>es, while they sat  helpless upon the margin of the grey <
line 21626=>and leafless world. <
line 21627=>0 gazed,  the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the <
line 21628=>Great River, and their boats turned  and began to speed southwards. Soon the <
line 21629=>white form of the Lady  was small and  distant. She  shone like a window  of <
line 21630=>glass  upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a  <
line 21631=>len in the lap of the land. Then  it seemed to Frodo <
line 21632=>that she lifted her arms in a  final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on <
line 21633=>the followinsound of her voice singing. But now she  sang in <
line 21634=>ongue of the Elves  beyond the Sea, and he  did not understand  <
line 21635=>but it did not comfort him. <
line 21636=>     Yet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained  graven in his memory,  <
line 21637=>and long afterwards he interpreted  them, as well as he could:  the language <
line 21638=>at of Elven -song and spoke of things little known on Middle-earth. <

line 21679=>that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I <
line 21680=>r of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in  this <
line 21681=>parting, even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Lord. Alas for <
line 21682=>Gimli son of Gluin! ' <
line 21683=>     `Nay! ' said Legolas. `Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world <
line 21684=>in these after -days. For  such is the  way of  it:  to find and lose,  as it <
line 21685=>seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed, <
line 21686=>Gimli son of Gluin: for your loss you suffer of your own  free will, and you  <
line 21687=>ht have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken  your companions, <

line 21700=>n their long way, down the wide  hurrying waters,  <
line 21701=>borne ever  southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could <
line 21702=>ds behind. The breeze died  away and the River <
line 21703=>reeze died  away and the River  sound. No voice  of  bird broke the silence.  The  sun grew <
line 21704=>misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky  like a high white <
line 21705=> into the West, and dusk came  early, followed by a grey <
line 21706=>and  starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours they  floated on, guiding <
line 21707=>erhanging shadows  of the western woods. Great trees <
line 21708=>passed  by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty  roots  through  the <

line 21710=>the  faint lap and  gurgle  of  the River fretting among the  tree-roots and <

line 21720=>bank of the  Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night  away, and the grey <
line 21721=>among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire <
line 21722=>near at hand. <
line 21723=>in  before   the day  was broad.  Not that most of  the <
line 21724=> were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision, <
line 21725=>0latest  when they came  to  Rauros and the Tindrock  <
line 21726=>Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the River  bear them on at its <
line 21727=> to hasten  towards  the perils that lay beyond, <
line 21728=>whichever course they  took in  the end. Aragorn  let  them  drift with  the <
line 21729=>stream as they wished, husbanding their  strength against weariness to come.  <
line 21730=>But he insisted that at least they should  start early  each day and journey <
line 21731=>on  far into the evening; for he felt  in his heart that  time was pressing, <
line 21732=>he Dark Lord  had not been idle while  they lingered in <
line 21733=>Lurien. <
line 21734=>     Nonetheless  they saw no sign of  an enemy that  day, nor the next. The <
line 21735=>dull grey hours passed without event. As the third  day of their voyage wore <
line 21736=>on the lands changed slowly: the trees  thinned and  then failed altogether. <
line 21737=> to their left  they saw long formless slopes stretching <
line 21738=> away toward the sky; brown and withered they  looked, as  if fire had <
line 21739=>ng no  living  blade of green:  an  unfriendly waste <
line 21740=>without even a broken tree or a  bold  stone to relieve the  emptiness. They <
line 21741=>had come to  the Brown Lands  that lay, vast and  desolate, between Southern <
line 21742=>Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence or war or evil deed <
line 21743=>of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell. <
line 21744=>their  right the land was treeless  also,  but it  was <
line 21745=>flat, and  in many places green  with wide plains of grass. On this side  of <
line 21746=>sts of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all <
line 21747=>view to  the  west,  as  the  little  boats  went   rustling by  along  their <
line 21748=>fluttering bok withered plumes bent and tossed in  the light <
line 21749=>ing softly and sadly. Here and there through  openings  Frodo <
line 21750=>could catch sudden  glimpses of rolling meads, and far  beyond them hills in <
line 21751=>and  away on  the edge of sight a dark line, where marched  the <

line 21754=> many: small  fowl whistling  and  piping in  the reeds,  but  they were <
line 21755=>seldom seen.  Once  or  twice the  travellers  heard  the rush  and whine of <
line 21756=>gs, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky. <
line 21757=>And mighty big ones too! ' <
line 21758=>     `Yes,' said Aragorn, 'and they are black swans.' <
line 21759=>     `How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks! '  said Frodo.  <
line 21760=>`I  always imagined  that as one journeyed  south it got warmer and merrier,  <
line 21761=>until winter was left behind for ever.' <
line 21762=>nd for ever.' But we  have not journeyed  far south yet,'  answered Aragorn. `It  is <
line 21763=> far from the sea. Here the world  is cold until the <

line 21777=>     Sam looked from bank to  bank  uneasily. The trees had  seemed  hostile <
line 21778=>before, as if they harboured secret eyes and  lurking dangers; now he wished  <
line 21779=>that  the trees were still  there. He felt  that the  Company was too naked, <

line 21781=>river that was the frontier of war. <

line 21783=> grew  on  all the Company. For  a whole day they <

line 21790=>0ithered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of <
line 21791=>ains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlurien. There <
line 21792=>was little speech and  no laughter  in any of  the boats. Each member of the <

line 22168=>sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of  grey  limestone-boulders,  <
line 22169=> shrouded with weeds and bushes;  there were thickets <

line 22172=>     One  by  one  Boromir and  Aragorn  carried the boats, while the others <

line 22203=>down  lower,  and it began to rain heavily. They drew  the  skin-covers over  <
line 22204=>their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on: little could <
line 22205=>be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains. <
line 22206=>     The rain,  however, did  not  last  long.  Slowly  the  sky above  grew <

line 22210=>upon  shelves  and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn  trees. The channel grew <
line 22211=>narrower and the River swifter. Now  they were speeding  along  with  little  <
line 22212=>ning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a  <
line 22213=>lane of pale-blue sky, around them  the dark overshadowed  River, and before <

line 22219=>between them, and the River swept the boats towards it. <

line 22221=>all pass them soon. Keep the boats  in  line, and as far apart as you can!  <
line 22222=>Hold the middle of the stream! ' <
line 22223=> of the stream! '   borne towards them the great  pillars rose like towers to <
line 22224=>t  him.  Giants  they  seemed  to  him,  vast  grey  figures  silent  but <
line 22225=>threatening. Then  he saw that they were  indeed shaped and  fashioned:  the <
line 22226=>craft and power  of  old had  wrought  upon them,  and  still they preserved <
line 22227=>0s of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which <

line 22235=>Frodo,  and he  cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as <
line 22236=> boat drew  near. Even Boromir bowed  his head  as  the boats whirled by. <
line 22237=>as little  leaves,  under  the  enduring  shadow of the <

line 22250=>     'Fear not!  ' he said. `Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses <

line 22257=>     The  chasm was long and  dark,  and filled  with the noise of wind  and <
line 22258=>rushing water and echoing stone. It  bent somewhat  towards the west so that <
line 22259=>0ead; but soon Frodo  saw a tall gap of light before <
line 22260=>him,  ever  growing.  Swiftly it  drew  near,  and  suddenly the  boats shot <
line 22261=>through, out r light. <
line 22262=>long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. <
line 22263=>The pent  waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale  Nen Hithoel, fenced <

line 22267=>d from the others and sundered   in the waters,  about  which   the flowing River  flung pale <
line 22268=>shimmering arms. Distant but deep there came up on the wind a  roaring sound <
line 22269=>like the roll of thunder heard far away. <
line 22270=> heard far away.    `Behold Tol Brandir! ' said Aragorn,  pointing south to  the tall peak. <
line 22271=>'Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of <

line 22322=>clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with  gold. Frodo looked out <

line 22409=>@  up. His heart went suddenly cold.  He caught the  strange <
line 22410=>gleam in  Boromir's eyes, yet his face was still kind  and friendly.  'It is <

line 22430=>this  hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why <
line 22431=>ing would give  me power of Command. How I would <
line 22432=>drive the <
line 22433=>hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!' <
line 22434=>     Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed <
line 22435=>to have forgotten Frodo, while  his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the <
line 22436=> men;  and he drew  plans  for  great alliances  and  glorious <
line 22437=>victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself  a mighty king, <

line 22444=>again. `You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should  pardon <

line 22455=>`You <
line 22456=>need  rest before your venture. if  go you must.' He laid  his  hand on  the <
line 22457=>hobbit's  shoulder in friendly fashion;  but Frodo  felt  the hand trembling <
line 22458=>suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the <
line 22459=>his height and many times his match in strength. <
line 22460=>     `Why are you  so unfriendly? '  said Boromir. `I am a true man, neither  <
line 22461=> Ring: that you know now; but  I give  you my  <
line 22462=>know now; but  I give  you my  not  desire to keep it.  Will you not at least  let me  make <

line 22472=>between them. `Come, come, my friend! ' said Boromir in a softer voice. 'Why <
line 22473=>not get rid of it? Why not be free of your  doubt and  fear? You can lay the <
line 22474=>  will.  You  can say that I was too strong and took it by <
line 22475=>force. For I am  too strong for you, halfling,' he cried;  and  suddenly  he <
line 22476=>  and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face  was <
line 22477=>hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes. <
line 22478=>de and again put the stone between them. There was only <
line 22479=>ng he could do: trembling  he pulled  out the Ring upon its chain and <
line 22480=>quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him  again.  The <
line 22481=>, stared for a  moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking <
line 22482=>here and there among the rocks and trees. <
line 22483=> among the rocks and trees. ickster!' he shouted. `Let me  get my  hands on you! Now I <
line 22484=>your mind. You  will take the Ring  to Sauron and  sell us all. You have <
line 22485=>only waited  your  chance to  leave  us  in  the  lurch. Curse  you and  all <
line 22486=>halflings to death  and darkness! ' Then, catching his foot on  a stone,  he <
line 22487=>on his face. For a while he was as still as if his <
line 22488=>own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept. <
line 22489=>sed  his  hand  over his eyes, dashing away  the tears.  <
line 22490=>'What have I said? ' he cried. `What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! ' he called.  <
line 22491=>'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back! ' <
line 22492=>r. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was  already <
line 22493=>far  away, leaping  blindly up  the path to the hill -top. Terror  and  grief <
line 22494=> thought the  mad fierce face of Boromir,  and his <
line 22495=>burning eyes. <
line 22496=>on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted,  gasping <
line 22497=>saw as through a mist a  wide  flat circle, paved with mighty <
line 22498=>flags, and surrounded with  a crumbling battlement;  and in the middle,  set <
line 22499=>llars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. <
line 22500=>Up  he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like  a lost  child that <
line 22501=>throne of mountain-kings.  <
line 22502=>     At first he could see little. He seemed  to be in a  world of  mist  in <
line 22503=> shadows: the Ring  was upon him.  Then here and there <
line 22504=>the mist gave way and he saw  many visions: small and clear as if they  were <
line 22505=>a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright <
line 22506=>living images.  The world  seemed to have shrunk  and  fallen silent. He was <
line 22507=>sitting  Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men <
line 22508=>or. Eastward he looked into  wide uncharted lands, nameless plains,  <
line 22509=>rthward he looked, and the Great  River lay like a <
line 22510=>ribbon beneath him, and the  Misty Mountains stood small and hard  as broken <
line 22511=>saw  the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, <
line 22512=>astures of Rohan; and Orthanc, Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below <
line 22513=>his very feet the  Great River curled  like a toppling wave and plunged over <
line 22514=>the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the <
line 22515=>fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of <
line 22516=> a white dust  in the  sun, and  beneath them a green <
line 22517=>and silver sea, rippling in endless lines.  <
line 22518=>silver sea, rippling in endless lines.  d he saw  the signs of  war. The Misty Mountains <
line 22519=>  like anthills:  orcs were  issuing out  of a thousand holes.  <
line 22520=>there was  deadly strife of Elves and Men and <
line 22521=>ly strife of Elves and Men and   land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; <

line 22526=>tains  and laden wains. All  the power of the Dark Lord was <
line 22527=>in  motion. Then turning south  again  he  beheld Minas Tirith. Far away  it <
line 22528=>lþ: white-walled,  many-towered, proud  and fair upon its <

line 22530=>bright wi Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith <
line 22531=>nother  fortress,  greater and more  strong.  Thither,  eastward, <
line 22532=> It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the <
line 22533=>grinning  gates of  Minas Morgul. and the  haunted Mountains, and it  looked <
line 22534=>0pon Gorgoroth,  the  valley of terror  in the  Land  of Mordor. Darkness lay <
line 22535=>there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, <
line 22536=>great  reek  rising.  Then at last  his  gaze was held: wall  upon  wall, <
line 22537=>battlement  upon  battlement, black, immeasurably strong,  mountain of iron, <
line 22538=>gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw  it: Barad-dyr,  Fortress of Sauron. <
line 22539=>0-     And suddenly he felt the  Eye. There was an eye  in the Dark Tower that <
line 22540=>did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze.  A fierce eager  <
line 22541=>will  was there.  It leaped  towards him; almost  like a finger he  felt it, <
line 22542=>ery soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where <
line 22543=>he was. Amon  Lhaw it touched. It glanced  upon Tol Brandir he threw himself <
line 22544=>from the, covering his head with his grey hood. <
line 22545=>rying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I  come, I <
line 22546=>come to  you? He could not tell. Then  as a flash  from some other point  of <
line 22547=>mind another thought: Take it off!  Take  it off! <
line 22548=>Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring! <
line 22549=>f the Ring! he two powers strove in him. For a moment,  perfectly balanced between <
line 22550=> he  writhed,  tormented. Suddenly  he was aware  of <
line 22551=>himself  again. Frodo, neither  the  Voice nor the Eye: free to choose,  and <
line 22552=>with  one  rt in  which to  do so. He  took the Ring off his <
line 22553=>s kneeling in clear  sunlight before  the  high  seat. A black  <
line 22554=>arm above him; it  missed Amon Hen and <
line 22555=>e him; it  missed Amon Hen and aded. Then all the sky was  clean and blue and birds sang in <
line 22556=>every tree. <
line 22557=>s feet. A great weariness was on him,  but his will was <
line 22558=>firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. `I  will do now what I <
line 22559=>t least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at <
line 22560=>work even in the Company,  and the Ring must leave them before it  does more <
line 22561=>I cannot  trust, and  those I  can trust are too <
line 22562=>dear  to me: poor old  Sam,  and Merry and  Pippin. Strider,  too: his heart <
line 22563=>yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen <
line 22564=>into evil. I will go alone. At once.' <
line 22565=>alone. At once.' t quickly  down the path and came back to the lawn where  Boromir <
line 22566=>, listening. He thought he could hear cries and  <
line 22567=>calls from the woods near the shore below.  <
line 22568=>hore below.      'They'll be hunting  for  me,' he  said. `I wonder how long I have been <
line 22569=>ld think.' He hesitated. 'What can  I  do? ' he muttered. <
line 22570=>'I must go now or I shall never go.  I shan't  get  a  chance  again. I hate <
line 22571=>leaving this without  any explanation. But surely  they will <

line 22573=> will. And what else can I do?' the Ring and put it  on  once more. He vanished and  <
line 22574=>passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind. <

line 22576=>t; but now they  were sitting in a circle, and <
line 22577=> were sitting in a circle, and ng. Every now  and again they made efforts to speak of other  <
line 22578=>0hings,  of  their  long road and many  adventures;  they questioned Aragorn <
line 22579=>m of Gondor and its ancient  history, and the remnants of <
line 22580=>its great works that could still be seen in this strange border -land  of the <
line 22581=>Ælþkings and  the  seats of Lhaw and Hen, and  the  great <
line 22582=>Stair  beside  the falls  of  Rauros. But always  their  thoughts  and words <

line 22584=>ng?  <
line 22585=>ch course  is  the most desperate, I think,'  said <
line 22586=>Aragorn. 'And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company <
line 22587=>to  go east, since we have  been tracked by Gollum,  and  must fear that the <
line 22588=>secret of our journey is already betrayed.  But Minas Tirith is no nearer to <

line 22593=>y when he comes  to take it.  Which way would any of us choose in <
line 22594=>Frodo's place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.' <
line 22595=>  said Legolas.  'Yet we must needs make up  our <
line 22596=>his aid.  Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call <
line 22597=>him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.' <
line 22598=>     `And so should I,'  said Gimli. 'We, of course, were only sent  to help <
line 22599=>oad, to go no further than we wished; and none of us <

line 22602=>Lothlurien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we  have reached the <
line 22603=>last  choice, it  is clear to  me that I  cannot leave Frodo. I would choose <
line 22604=>t, then I follow him.' <
line 22605=>     `And I  too will go with him,' said Legolas. `It would be faithless now <
line 22606=>t would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,' said Aragorn. 'But <
line 22607=>if  he goes east,  then all need not go  with him; nor  do I think that  all <
line 22608=>should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, <
line 22609=>d let me choose,  then  I should  appoint three <

line 22614=>     `That won't do at all! ' cried Merry. 'We can't leave Frodo! Pippin and <
line 22615=>ays intended to go wherever he went,  and we still  do. But we did not <
line 22616=>mean. It  seemed different so far away, in the Shire <
line 22617=>or in Rivendell. It  would  be mad and cruel to let Frodo go  to Mordor. Why  <
line 22618=>We must stop  him,'  said Pippin.  `And  that is what  he  is worrying <
line 22619=>about, I am sure. He knows we shan't agree to his going east. And  he doesn't  <
line 22620=>like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to <

line 22628=>Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on  the outside of the circle, <
line 22629=>was no longer there. <
line 22630=>     `Now where's he got to? ' cried Sam, looking worried.  'He's been a bit <
line 22631=>d. But anyway he's  not in this business. He's off to <
line 22632=>his  home, as he always said;  and no blame to  him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows <

line 22659=>     `Where have you been, Boromir? ' asked Aragorn. `Have you seen Frodo? ' <
line 22660=> a second.  `Yes,  and no,'  he  answered slowly. <
line 22661=>`Yes: I found him some way up the hill,  and I spoke to  him. I urged him to  <

line 22667=>kindly at Boromir. <
line 22668=>     `Yes,' he answered. `I will say no more yet.' <
line 22669=>ed Sam, jumping up. `I don't know  what this Man has <
line 22670=>been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put  the thing on? He didn't ought to have; <
line 22671=>and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!' <

line 23194=>     'Ah!  the green smell!'  he said. 'It is better than much sleep. Let us <

line 23260=>to do so.' <
line 23261=>     'I said that  it  was a  hard  choice,' said Aragorn.  'How shall we end <
line 23262=>this debate?' <
line 23263=>     'You are our guide,' said Gimli, 'and you are skilled in the chase. You  <
line 23264=>shall choose.' <
line 23265=>     'My heart  bids me go on,'  said Legolas. 'But we must hold together. I <
line 23266=>.' <
line 23267=>     'You give the choice to an ill chooser,' said Aragorn. 'Since we passed <
line 23268=>through the Argonath  my  choices have  gone amiss.' He  fell  silent gazing <
line 23269=>north and west into the gathering night for a long while. <
line 23270=>     'We will  not walk in  the dark,'  he  said at length.   'The  peril  of <
line 23271=> signs  of  other  coming and  going seems to  me  the <
line 23272=>greater. If the  Moon gave enough  light, we would use it, but alas! he sets <
line 23273=> pale.' <
line 23274=>     'And  tonight he is shrouded anyway,' Gimli murmured.  'Would  that the <
line 23275=>0given us a light, such a gift as she gave to Frodo!' <
line 23276=>     'It will be more needed  where it is bestowed,' said Aragorn. 'With him <
line 23277=>is but a small matter in the great deeds of this <
line 23278=>time. A vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no  choice of mine can <
line 23279=>mar or mend. Well, I have chosen. So let us use the time as best we may!' <
line 23280=>     He  cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he  had <
line 23281=>pt since their night under the shadow of Tol Brandir. Before dawn was <
line 23282=>in the sky he woke and rose.  Gimli  was still deep in slumber,  but Legolas <
line 23283=>was standing,  gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as <
line 23284=>ght.  <
line 23285=>     'They are  far far away,' he said sadly, turning to Aragorn. 'I know in <
line 23286=>at they have not rested this night.  Only an eagle could overtake <
line 23287=> we will still follow as we may,' said Aragorn. Stooping he <
line 23288=>roused the Dwarf. 'Come! We must go,' he said. 'The scent is growing cold.' <
line 23289=>Ælþdark,' said Gimli. 'Even Legolas on a  hill-top  could <
line 23290=>not see them till the Sun is up.' <
line 23291=>s up.' -     'I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon <
line 23292=>0olas.  <
line 23293=>the earth may  bring us rumour,' said  Aragorn. 'The <
line 23294=>  groan under  their hated  feet.' He stretched  himself  upon the <
line 23295=>ground with his ear pressed against the turf. He lay  there  motionless, for  <
line 23296=>e that Gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again. <
line 23297=>ly a grey  light grew about them.  At last he <
line 23298=>t grew about them.  At last he  friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his <
line 23299=>look was troubled. <
line 23300=>r of the earth is dim and confused,' he said. 'Nothing  walks <
line 23301=>upon it for many miles about  us. Faint and far are the feet of our enemies.  <

line 23303=>even  as  I lay on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams:  hor ses <
line 23304=>in the West. But now they are  drawing ever further from <
line 23305=>us, riding northward. I wonder what is happening in this land!' <
line 23306=>'Let us go!' said Legolas.  <
line 23307=>     So the third day of their pursuit began. During  all its long  hours of <
line 23308=>they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no <
line 23309=>weariness could quench the  fire that burned them.  They seldom spoke.  Over  <
line 23310=> passed  and their elven-cloaks  faded  against  the <
line 23311=>background of the grey-green fields; even  in the cool  sunlight  of mid-day <

line 23316=>without a break or turn. As once again the  day wore to its end they came to  <
line 23317=>0re the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low <
line 23318=>humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter  as it bent north towards <
line 23319=>them, for  thharder  and the grass  shorter. Far away to the <
line 23320=> Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor.  No  moving <
line 23321=>thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered  that they saw no sign  of beast <
line 23322=>ngs of the  Rohirrim were for the most  part many leagues <
line 23323=>away to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now <

line 23325=>studs  in  the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the <
line 23326=>herdsmench, living  in  camp  and tent, even in winter -time. <
line 23327=>0 now  all the land was empty, and there was silence  that did not seem to  <
line 23328=>e. <
line 23329=>     At  dusk they halted  again. Now twice twelve  leagues  they had passed <
line 23330=>over  the plains of Rohan  and  the wall of  the Emyn Muil was  lost in  the <
line 23331=>shadows  of the East. The  young moon  was glimmering in a misty sky, but it <
line 23332=>and the stars were veiled. <
line 23333=>     'Now  do I most  grudge  a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said <
line 23334=>Legolas. 'The Orcs have run before us, as if  the very whips  of Sauron were <
line 23335=>hem. I fear they have already reached the forest and  the dark hills, <
line 23336=>and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.' <
line 23337=>This  is a bitter end to our  hope and to all <
line 23338=>er end to our  hope and to all d. <
line 23339=>nd to our  hope and to all d. not to  toil,'  said Aragorn. 'We shall not turn <
line 23340=> I am weary.' He gazed  back along the  way that they had come <
line 23341=>towards the night gathering in the East. 'There is something strange at work <
line 23342=>in this land.  I distrust the  silence. I  distrust even  the pale Moon. The <
line 23343=>s are  faint; and I am weary a s I have  seldom been before,  weary as no <
line 23344=> a clear trail to follow. There is some will that lends <
line 23345=>speed  to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is <
line 23346=>0 the limb.' <
line 23347=>     'Truly!' said Legolas. 'That I have known since first we came down from <
line 23348=>the Emyn Muil. For the will is not behind us but before us.' He pointed away <
line 23349=>an  into  the darkling West  under  the sickle  moon. <
line 23350=>'Saruman!'  muttered Aragorn. 'But he shall not  turn  us back!  Halt we must  <
line 23351=>once moren the  Moon  is falling  into gathering  cloud. But <
line 23352=>our road between down and fen when day returns.' <
line 23353=>     As before Legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. 'Awake!  <
line 23354=>dawn. Strange things await us by the eaves of <
line 23355=>hings await us by the eaves of or evil, I do not know; but we are called. Awake!' <
line 23356=>     The others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the <
line 23357=> an hour before  noon when they  reached them: <
line 23358=> noon when they  reached them: ing to bare ridges  that ran in a line straight  towards the <
line 23359=>North. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long strip <
line 23360=>of  sunken  land,  some  ten  miles  wide, lay  between them  and the  river  <
line 23361=>ring deep in  dim  thickets of reed  and rush. Just to  the West of the <
line 23362=>southernmost slope there was a great ring, where  the turf had been torn and <
line 23363=>0 many trampling feet. From it  the orc-trail ran out again, turning <
line 23364=>  skirts  of the hills. Aragorn halted and examined  the <
line 23365=>tracks closely. <
line 23366=>e a  while,' he said,  'but even the outward  trail  is <
line 23367=>already  old. I  fear  that your  heart  spoke truly,  Legolas: it is thrice <
line 23368=>twelve hours, I guess, since the Orcs stood where we now stand. If they held <
line 23369=>to their pace,  then  at sundown  yesterday they would reach  the borders of <
line 23370=>thing  away north or west but  grass dwindling into mist,' <
line 23371=>said Gimli. 'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?' <
line 23372=>     'It is  still  far  away,'  said Aragorn. 'If I remember rightly, these <
line 23373=>downs run  eight leagues  or  more to the north, and then north-west to  the <
line 23374=>issuing of the Entwash there lies still a wide land. another fifteen leagues <
line 23375=>0let  us go on,' said Gimli. 'My legs must forget the miles. They <
line 23376=>would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.' <
line 23377=>     The sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the  end of the line <
line 23378=>s they had  marched without rest. They  were going <
line 23379=>slowly now, and Gimli's back was bent.  Stone-hard are the Dwarves in labour <

line 23381=>ell on him, as all hope failed agorn walked behind  him, grim and silent,  stooping now and <
line 23382=>again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped <
line 23383=>  his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no <
line 23384=>footprints  as he passed; but in  the waybread of the Elves he found all the <
line 23385=>ed, and  he could sleep, if sleep it  could be called <
line 23386=>by Men, resting his mind in the strange  paths of elvish dreams,  even as he <
line 23387=>ht of this world. <
line 23388=>     'Let us go  up on to this green hill!' he said.  Wearily they  fol lowed <
line 23389=>until  they  came out upon the  top. It  was a  <
line 23390=>round hill smooth and  bare, standing by itself,  the  most northerly of the <
line 23391=>0owns. The sun sank  and  the  shadows of evening fell  like a curtain. They  <
line 23392=>were alone  in a gr ey formless world without mark or measure. Only  far away <
line 23393=>th-west  there  was  a  deeper darkness  against  the  dying  light:  the <
line 23394=>Mountains of Mist and the forest at their feet. <
line 23395=>     'Nothing can  we see to guide us here,' said Gimli. 'Well, now we  must  <

line 23398=>     'And ere morning  it will be in  the East,' said Legolas.  'But rest if <

line 23401=>ound at the rising of the Sun.' risen on  our  chase and brought no counsel ' <

line 23403=>Ælþey saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to <
line 23404=>and <
line 23405=>fro, singing softly to  himself in his own tongue, and as  he sang the white <
line 23406=>stars  opened in  the hard black vault above. So the  night passed. Together  <
line 23407=>they watched the dawn grow slowly in the  sky, now bare and cloudless, until <
line 23408=>t was pale and clear. The  wind was  in the East  <
line 23409=>and  all the mists had rolled away;  wide lands lay bleak about them in  the <
line 23410=>astward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that <
line 23411=>they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North-<
line 23412=>rest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy <
line 23413=>eaves, and its  further  slopes  faded into  the distant blue. Beyond  there <
line 23414=>glimmerif floating  on a  grey cloud, the white head of tall <
line 23415=>0, the  last  peak  of  the  Misty Mountains. Out of  the forest the <
line 23416=>, its  stream now swift and narrow, and its banks <
line 23417=>deep-cloven. The orc-trail turned from the downs towards it. <
line 23418=>with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river  <
line 23419=>back towards the forest,  Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green,  a dark  <
line 23420=>swift-moving  blur.  He cast  himself upon  the  ground  and  listened again <
line 23421=>intently.  But Legolas stood beside him, shading  his bright elven-eyes with <
line 23422=>, and he saw not a  shadow, nor  a blur, but the  small <
line 23423=>figures  of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of <
line 23424=>their spee twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal <
line 23425=>behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.  <
line 23426=>     There was a silence  in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air <
line 23427=>0   'Riders!' cried Aragorn, springing to  his feet.  'Many riders on swift <
line 23428=>steeds are coming towards us!' <
line 23429=>olas, 'there are one hundred  and five. Yellow is  their <
line 23430=>hair, and bright are their spears. Their leader is very tall.' <
line 23431=>     Aragorn smiled. 'Keen are the eyes of the Elves,' he said. <
line 23432=><
line 23433=>####-     'Nay!  The  riders are little  more  than  five leagues distant,'  said <
line 23434=>Legolas.  <
line 23435=>     'Five leagues or  one,' said Gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare <
line 23436=>land. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?' <
line 23437=>   'We will wait,' said Aragorn. 'I  am weary, and our hunt has failed. Or <
line 23438=>at least  others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the <

line 23442=> that we should hear good news,' said  Aragorn. 'But evil <
line 23443=>or good we will await it here.' <
line 23444=>e.'  The three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy  <
line 23445=>mark  sky, and they walked slowly down the northward  slope. <
line 23446=>A little  above the hill's foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about <
line 23447=>them, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass. The time passed slowly <
line 23448=>and heavily. The wind was thin and searching. Gimli was uneasy. <
line 23449=> do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?' he said. 'Do we sit here <
line 23450=>     'I have been among them,' answered Aragorn. 'They are proud and wilful, <
line 23451=>but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; <
line 23452=>wise but unlearned,  writing no books  but  singing many  songs,  after  the <
line 23453=> of Men before the Dark Years. But I do not know  what <
line 23454=>has happened here of late, nor in what mind the Rohirrim may now  be between <

line 23460=>fair, <
line 23461=>as are the Riders of Rohan. At least they will not love the Orcs.' <

line 23466=>     At length even Gimli could  hear the distant  beat of  galloping hoofs. <
line 23467=>The horsemen,  following  the trail, had  turned  from the  river,   and were <
line 23468=> the downs. They were riding like the wind. <
line 23469=>hey were riding like the wind.  cries  of clear strong voices  came ringing over  the  fields. <
line 23470=>oise like thunder, and  the foremost horseman <
line 23471=>er, and  the foremost horseman by  the  foot  of  the  hill,  and  leading  the  host  back  <
line 23472=>southward along the western skirts of the downs. After him they rode: a long <
line 23473=>en. swift, shining, fell and fair to look upon. <
line 23474=>     Their horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed; their grey <
line 23475=>0oats  glistened, their  long tails flowed  in the  wind, their  manes  were <
line 23476=>braided on their proud necks. The Men that rode them matched them well: tall <
line 23477=>ong-limbed; their hair, flaxen -pale,  flowed under  their  light helms,  <
line 23478=>and streamed in long braids behind them; their faces were stern and keen. In <
line 23479=>their  hands were tall  spears of ash,  painted  shields were slung at their <
line 23480=>0t their belts, their burnished skirts of  mail hung <
line 23481=>down upon their knees.  <
line 23482=>     In pairs  they galloped  by, and though every now  and then one rose in <
line 23483=> stirrups  and  gazed ahead  and to  either side, they appeared  not  to <
line 23484=>rangers sitting silently and  watching them. The  host  <
line 23485=>had almost passed  when  suddenly Aragorn  st ood  up, and  called in a  loud <
line 23486=>voice: <
line 23487=>from the North, Riders of Rohan?' <
line 23488=>m the North, Riders of Rohan?' nd  skill they  checked  their steeds, wheeled, <
line 23489=>and came charging round.  Soon the three companions  found  themselves  in a  <
line 23490=>ring of horsemen  moving in a running circle, up the hill -slope  behind them <
line 23491=>0and round  them, and  drawing  ever inwards. Aragorn  stood <
line 23492=>silent, and  the other two  sat  without  moving, wondering what  way things <
line 23493=>hout a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears <
line 23494=>were  pointed towards the strangers; and some  of the  horsemen had bows  in <
line 23495=>hand, and their  arrows were  already fitted  to the  string. Then one  rode <
line 23496=>an  all the rest; from  his helm as a crest  a  <
line 23497=> flowed. He advanced  until the point of his spear was within <
line 23498=>a foot of Aragorn's breast. Aragorn did not stir. <
line 23499=>     'Who are  you,  and what are you doing  in this  land?' said the Rider, <
line 23500=>using the  Common Speech of the West, in manner and tone like  to the speech <
line 23501=> Gondor. <
line 23502=>     'I am called Strider,' answered Aragorn. 'I came out of the North. I am <
line 23503=>hunting Orcs.' <
line 23504=>om  his horse. Giving his spear to another  who rode <
line 23505=>nd dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with  <
line 23506=>m keenly, and not  without wonder. At  length  he spoke <
line 23507=>again. <
line 23508=>ou yourselves were Orcs,' he said; 'but now I <
line 23509=>ere Orcs,' he said; 'but now I ot so. Indeed  you know  little of Orcs, if  you go hunting <

line 23511=>d from hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them. <
line 23512=>But there is something strange about you, Strider.' He bent his clear bright <
line 23513=>0r. 'That  is  no name for a Man that  you give. And <
line 23514=>strange too is your raiment.  Have you sprung out of the  grass? How did you <
line 23515=>escape our siish folk?' <
line 23516=>agorn.  'One  only of us  is an  Elf, Legolas  from  the <

line 23520=>     The Rider looked at them  with  renewed wonder, but  his eyes hardened. <
line 23521=>'Then there  is a Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales tell!' he said. 'Few <
line 23522=>escape  her  nets, they  say. These are  strange days! But if  you  have her  <
line 23523=>favour, then you  also are  net -weavers and  sorcerers,  maybe.' He turned a  <
line 23524=>cold glance suddenly upon Legolas and Gimli.  'Why do you  not speak, silent <
line 23525=>imli  rose and  planted  his feet  firmly apart: his hand gripped  the <
line 23526=>handle  of  his  axe,  and  his  dark  eyes flashed.  'Give  me  your  name, <
line 23527=>horse-master, and I will give you mine, and more besides,' he said. <
line 23528=>'As for that,' said the Rider, staring down at the Dwarf, 'the stranger  <

line 23535=>ears. 'I  would cut  off your  head, beard and  all, <

line 23537=>     'He stands not  alone,'  said Legolas,  bending his bow and fitting  an <
line 23538=>s that moved quicker than sight. 'You would  die before  your <
line 23539=>0troke fell.' <
line 23540=>raised  his sword, and things might  have  gone ill, but Aragorn <
line 23541=>ed his hand. 'Your pardon,  Jomer!' he  cried.  <
line 23542=>'When you know more you will understand why  you have angered my <

line 23983=>no <

line 23988=>and  dozens of other goblins had sprung out  of the  trees. Merry and he had <

line 23990=>to lay  hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several  of their arms and <

line 24004=>     He could  not  answer the questions. He felt  cold and  sick.  'I  wish <

line 24092=> their knives and swords,  but ck UglÂ®k. <
line 24093=>s and swords,  but ck UglÂ®k. , and a  number of other Orcs of  nearly his own size ran <
line 24094=>up. Then suddenly, without  warning, UglÂ®k sprang  forwards,  and  with  two <
line 24095=>swift strokes swept  the heads  off two of his opponents.  Grishnbkh stepped <
line 24096=>aside and  vanished  into the  shadows. The others gave way, and one stepped <
line 24097=>Merry's  prostrate  form with  a  curse. Yet  that <
line 24098=>probably saved his life, for UglÂ®k's followers leaped over him and  cut down <
line 24099=>another with ed swords. It was the yellow-fanged  guard. His <
line 24100=> on top of Pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife. <
line 24101=>     'Put up your weapons!' shouted UglÂ®k. 'And let's have no more nonsense! <

line 24105=><
line 24106=>####-while to get his  troop under control, I've got  a chance.' A gleam of  hope <
line 24107=>had come to him. The edge  of the black knife had snicked his arm, and  then <
line 24108=>slid down to his wrist.  He  felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he <

line 24116=>side, then hardly daring to  breathe, he drew the  knot of the wrist -cord up <
line 24117=>and down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held <
line 24118=>it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers and knotted  <
line 24119=> bracelet of two loops and slipped it  over his hands.  <
line 24120=>Then he lay very still. <
line 24121=>     'Pick up those prisoners!' shouted UglÂ®k.  'Don't play any  tricks with <
line 24122=>them! If they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.' <
line 24123=>Pippin like a sack. put its head between his tied hands,  <
line 24124=>grabbed his arms and  dragged them  down, until  Pippin's  face was  crushed <
line 24125=>it jolted off  with him. Another treated Merry in the <
line 24126=>same way. The Orc's clawlike hand gripped Pippin's arms like iron; the nails <
line 24127=>yes and slipped back into evil dreams.  <
line 24128=>lipped back into evil dreams.  rown on to the stony floor again. It was early night, <
line 24129=>but the  slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the  edge of a <

line 24298=>     The Isengarders seized Merry and  Pippin again  and slung them on their  <
line 24299=>backs started off. Hour after hour they ran, pausing now and <
line 24300=>nly to sling the hobbits to fresh  carriers. Either because they were <
line 24301=>0ecause of some plan of Grishnbkh's, the Isengarders <
line 24302=>gradually passed through the Orcs of Mordor,  and Grishnbkh's folk closed in <
line 24303=>ing also on  the Northerners ahead.  The forest  <
line 24304=>began to draw nearer. <
line 24305=>     Pippin was bruised and torn,  his aching  head was grated by the filthy <
line 24306=>0hairy ear of the Orc that held him. Immediately in front were bowed <

line 24308=>they were made of wire and horn,  beating out  the nightmare seconds  of  an <

line 24313=>re coming!' <
line 24314=>     A cry  from Grishnbkh  showed that  this was  not mere jest.  Horsemen, <
line 24315=>g very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still  far behind, but gaining <

line 24326=>     'They will  make it yet. They will escape,' thought Pippin. And then he <
line 24327=>managed  to twist  his neck.  so  as  to  glance back with  one eye over his <
line 24328=>shoulder. He saw that riders away eastward were already level with the Orcs, <
line 24329=>e plain.  The sunset gilded their spears  and helmets, and <
line 24330=>glinted  in  their  pale  flowing  hair.  They  were  hemming the  Orcs  in, <
line 24331=>Ælþ scattering, and  driving them along the  line of  the <
line 24332=>river. <
line 24333=>     He wondered  very much what kind of folk they were. He wished  now that <
line 24334=>he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in <
line 24335=>e days the plans for the journey seemed to be  in  more competent hands, <

line 24379=>     The night was  cold  and still. All round the knoll  on which  the  Orcs <

line 24382=>not  show themselves against  the light,  and the  Orcs wasted  many  arrows <

line 24472=>mouths. Then he sprang forward,  stooping low. Quickly and silently he went, <
line 24473=>e  of the knoll. There, choosing a gap  between the <
line 24474=>watchers, he passed like an evil shadow out into the  night, down  the slope <
line 24475=>and away weste river that  flowed out of the forest. In that <
line 24476=> was a wide open space with only one fire. <
line 24477=>open space with only one fire.  dozen yards he  halted,  peering and listening. Nothing <
line 24478=>could be  seen or heard. He crept  slowly  on, bent almost  double. Then  he <
line 24479=>squatted and listened  again. Then he stood up, as if to risk a sudden dash. <
line 24480=>At that very moment the  dark form of a  rider loomed up  right  in front of <
line 24481=>red. A man called out. <
line 24482=>     Grishnbkh flung himself on the ground flat,  dragging the hobbits under  <
line 24483=>0rd.  No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather  <
line 24484=>than allow them  to escape or to  be rescued;  but  it  was his undoing. The <
line 24485=>nted a  little in the light of the fire away  to <
line 24486=>his left. An arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill, <
line 24487=>or guided by fate, and it pierced his right hand. He dr opped the  sword  and <
line 24488=>shrieked. There was a quick beat of hoofs, and  even as  Grishnbkh leaped up <
line 24489=>and  ran,  he  was ridden down and  a spear  passed through  him.  He gave a  <
line 24490=>y and lay still. <
line 24491=>     The hobbits remained flat on  the  ground, as  Grishnbkh had left them. <
line 24492=>Another  horseman came riding swiftly  to his comrade's aid. Whether because <
line 24493=>enness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse <
line 24494=>lifted  and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did  not see them, lying <
line 24495=>Ælþ-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to <
line 24496=>move. <
line 24497=>     At  last  Merry stirred and whispered softly: 'So  far so good: but how <
line 24498=>are we to avoid being spitted?' <
line 24499=>d being spitted?' me almost immediately. The cries of Grishnbkh  had  roused <
line 24500=>Orcs. From the yells  and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits <
line 24501=>isappearance had been discovered:  UglÂ®k  was probably <
line 24502=>knocking  off  a  few  more  heads.  Then suddenly  the answering  cries  of <
line 24503=>0 right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the <
line 24504=>direction of the forest and the mountains. MauhÂ®r had apparently arrived and <
line 24505=> There was  the sound  of galloping  horses. The <
line 24506=>Riders  were  drawing  in  their  ring  close  round the  knoll, risking the <
line 24507=>orc-arrows, so as  to prevent any sortie, while a company  rode off to  deal <
line 24508=>with the newcomers.  Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized  that without moving <
line 24509=>they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape. <
line 24510=> Merry,  'if only we had our legs  and hands free,  we might <
line 24511=>get away. But I can't touch the knots, and I can't bite them.' <
line 24512=>     'No need to  try,'  said Pippin. 'I was going to tell you: I've managed <
line 24513=>to fThese loops are only  left for show. You'd better have a  <
line 24514=>f lembas first.' <
line 24515=>     He slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. The cakes <
line 24516=>were broken, but good,  still in their leaf-wrappings. The  hobbits each ate <
line 24517=>two  or three  pieces.  The  taste brought  back  to them the memory of fair <
line 24518=>faces,  and laughter, and wholesome food in  quiet  days now far away. For a <
line 24519=>fully, sitting in the dark, heedless  of the cries and <
line 24520=>sounds of battle nearby. Pippin was the first to come back to the present. <
line 24521=>     'We musid. 'Half a moment!' Grishnbkh's sword was lying <
line 24522=> but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled <

line 24528=>e turf was deep and yielding, and that helped them: but <
line 24529=>it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide  berth,  and <
line 24530=>wormed their way  forward bit  by  bit, until  they came to the edge  of the <
line 24531=>river, gurgling away in  the black shadows under its deep   banks. Then  they <
line 24532=>s  had  died away.  Evidently  MauhÂ®r  and his 'lads' had been <
line 24533=>killed or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. <
line 24534=>0 very much longer. Already  the night was old. In the East, <
line 24535=>ch had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale. <
line 24536=>     'We must get under cover,' said  Pippin, 'or we  shall be seen. It will <
line 24537=>rt  to us, if  these riders discover that we are  not Orcs <
line 24538=>after we are dead.' He got up and stamped his feet. 'Those cords have cut me <
line 24539=>Ælþt are getting warm again. I could stagger on now. What <
line 24540=>about you, Merry?' <
line 24541=>     Merry got up. 'Yes,' he said, 'I can  manage it. Lembas does put  heart <
line 24542=>you! A more  wholesome sort  of  feeling, too, than  the heat  of that <
line 24543=> what it was made of. Better not to  know, I expect. <
line 24544=>Let's get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it!' <
line 24545=>     'Not here, the banks are too steep,' said Pippin. 'Forward now!' <
line 24546=><
line 24547=>####-     They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river. <
line 24548=>Behind them the light grew in the East. As they  walked they compared notes,  <

line 24551=>suffered cruelly, and been in dire peril, going without hope towards torment  <

line 24568=>one so knowing will not have forgotten that.' <
line 24569=>will not have forgotten that.' ,' answered Merry; 'but the forest seems better to  me, all <
line 24570=>the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.' <
line 24571=>     He  led the way  in under the  huge branches  of  the trees. Old beyond <
line 24572=>eat  trailing  beards of lichen  hung  from  them, <
line 24573=>blowing and swaying in  the breeze. Out of the  shadows the  hobbits peeped, <

line 24575=>igures  that in the  dim light children  in the deeps  of time peering out of the Wild Wood  <
line 24576=>in wonder at their first Dawn. <
line 24577=>     Far  over the  Great  River,  and the  Brown  Lands,  leagues upon grey <
line 24578=>awn came,  red as flame.  Loud rang the hunting-horns  to <
line 24579=>greet it.  The Rider s of Rohan sprang suddenly  to life. Horn  answered horn <
line 24580=>  Pippin heard,  clear  in  the  cold  air,  the  neighing  of <
line 24581=>war-horses, and  the  sudden singing of many men. The Sun's limb was lifted, <
line 24582=>fire,  above the margin of the world. Then with a great  cry the <
line 24583=> the red  light gleamed on mail and spear. The <
line 24584=>gleamed on mail and spear. The  shot all the arrows that remained to  them. The hobbits saw <
line 24585=>several horsemen fall; but their line held on up  the hill  and  over it, and <
line 24586=>harged  again. Most  of the raiders that were  left alive <
line 24587=>then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. But <
line 24588=>her in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the  <
line 24589=>direction  of  the  forest.  Straight up the slope they charged  towards the <
line 24590=>awing near,  and it seemed certain that they would <
line 24591=>escape: they had already hewn down three Riders that barred their way. <
line 24592=>     'We have watched too long,' said Merry. 'There's UglÂ®k! I don't want to <
line 24593=>meet him again.' The hobbits turned and  fled deep into the  shadows of  the <
line 24594=>wood. <
line 24595=>     So it  was  that  they did not sec  the  last  stand,  when  UglÂ®k  was <
line 24596=>0ught to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he was slain <
line 24597=>at last by Jomer,  the Third Marshal  of the Mark, who dismounted and fought <
line 24598=>lþ And over  the  wide fields the keen-eyed Riders hunted <
line 24599=>down the few Orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly. <
line 24600=>     Then when they had  laid their fallen comrades in a  mound and had sung <
line 24601=>their praises, the Riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their <
line 24602=>enemies.  So ended  the raid, and no  news  of  it came ever back either  to <
line 24603=> the smoke of  the burning rose high to heaven and <
line 24604=>was seen by many watchful eyes.  <

line 24607=>forest allowed, following  the line of the  running  stream, westward and up <

line 24609=>their fear of the Orcs died away, and their pace slackened. A queer stifling <
line 24610=>feeling came  over  them,  as  if the air were  too thin or too  scanty  for  <
line 24611=>breathing. <
line 24612=>     At last Merry halted.  'We can't go on like this,' he  panted.  'I want <

line 24614=>clambered on to a  great tree-root that  wound  down  into the  stream,  and <
line 24615=>p some water in his cupped hands. It was clear and  cold, and <
line 24616=>0e  took many draughts.  Merry followed  him.  The water refreshed them  and <
line 24617=>eir hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of <
line 24618=>the  stream,  dabbling  their  sore feet and legs, and peering round at  the <

line 24621=>ection.     'I suppose you  haven't  lost us already?'  said  Pippin,  leaning back  <
line 24622=>ree-trunk.  'We  can  at  least follow the  course of this <
line 24623=>stream, the Entwash or whatever you call  it, and get  out again  the way we <
line 24624=>came.', if  our legs  would  do it,' said  Merry;  'and if  we could <
line 24625=>breathe properly.' <
line 24626=>     'Yes, it is  all  very  dim,  and stuffy,  in   here,' said Pippin.  'It <

line 24641=>frightfully  tree-ish.  You  can't imagine animals  living here  at all,  or <
line 24642=>o, nor hobbits,' said Pippin. 'And I don't like the thought of trying <
line 24643=>to get through  it  either.  Nothing to cat  for a  hundred  miles, I should <
line 24644=>guess. How are our supplies?' <
line 24645=>     'Low,'  said Merry.  'We ran  off  with nothing but a  couple of  spare <
line 24646=> everything else behind.' They  looked at what <
line 24647=> behind.' They  looked at what  elven-cakes:  broken  fragments for abou t five meagre days, <

line 24649=>way we go.' <
line 24650=>     'Well, we'd  better decide on  the way now,' said  Pippin. 'The morning <
line 24651=>must be getting on.' <
line 24652=>they became  aware of a yellow light that  had appeared, some <
line 24653=>way further  on into the  wood: shafts  of sunlight seemed  suddenly to have  <
line 24654=>pierced the forest -roof. <
line 24655=>     'Hullo!' said Merry.  'The Sun must have run into a cloud  while  we've <
line 24656=>been under these  trees, and now she  has  run  out  again; or  else she has <
line 24657=>climbed high enough to look down through some opening. It isn't far let's go <
line 24658=>te!' <
line 24659=>further than  they thought. The  ground was rising <
line 24660=>ll,  and  it was becoming  increasingly stony.  The  light  grew <
line 24661=>oon they saw that there was a rock -wall before <
line 24662=>them: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of  some long root thrust out by <
line 24663=>the distant mountains.  No trees grew on it, and the sun was falling full on <
line 24664=> twigs of the trees at  its foot were stretched out stiff <
line 24665=>and still, as if reaching out to the warmth. Where  all had looked so shabby <

line 24667=>ith rich browns, and with the  eys  of bark  like polished leather.  The boles of the trees  glowed <
line 24668=>with a soft green like young grass: early spring or  a fleeting vision of it <
line 24669=>was about them. <
line 24670=>ny wall there was something like a stair: natural <
line 24671=>perhaps, and  made by the weathering  and splitting  of the rock, for it was <
line 24672=>rough and uneven. High up, almost level with the tops of forest -trees, there <
line 24673=><
line 24674=>####-was a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at <
line 24675=>its edge, and  one old stump of a tree  with only two bent branches left: it <
line 24676=> like the figure  of some gnarled  old  man,  standing  there, <
line 24677=>blinking in the morning-light. <

line 24681=>surprised at the  remarkable  way  in  which the  cuts  and  sores of  their <
line 24682=>0 their  vigour had returned. They came at length to <
line 24683=>the edge  of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang <
line 24684=>their backs  to the  hill, breathing  deep, and <
line 24685=>looking  out eastward. They saw  that they had  only come some three or four <
line 24686=>miles  into the  forest:  the heads  of the  trees marched  down  the slopes <
line 24687=>towards the  plain. There, near the fringe  of  the forest,  tall spires  of <
line 24688=>curling black smoke went up, wavering and floating towards them. <
line 24689=>  'The wind's changing,'  said Merry.  'It's  turned east again. It feels <
line 24690=>'Yes,'  said Pippin; 'I'm  afraid this is only a passing  gleam, and it <
line 24691=>will  all go grey  again. What a  pity! This  shaggy  old  forest  looked so <

line 24696=>Turn round!' A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders,  <

line 24949=>e hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees stood there, one <
line 24950=>on  either side, like living gate-posts; bu t  there was  no gate  save their <
line 24951=>0rwoven boughs. As  the old Ent approached, the trees lifted <

line 24954=>twilight. Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great <

line 24956=>til they were fifty feet high  or more, and along each wall stood <

line 25002=>there was  some scent or savour in  it which they could not describe: it was <
line 25003=>of  the smell of a distant wood borne  from afar <
line 25004=>by a cool breeze at night. The effect of the  draught began at the toes, and <
line 25005=>rose  steadily  through every limb, bringing  refreshment  and vigour  as it <
line 25006=>coursed upwards, right to the tips of the hair. Indeed the hobbits felt that <
line 25007=>the  hair  on  their heads was actually standing up,  waving and curling and <

line 25009=>arch, and then he  drained his bowl at one draught, one long, slow  draught. <
line 25010=>The hobbitld never stop. <
line 25011=> set the bowl down again. 'Ah -- ah,' he sighed. 'Hm,  hoom, <
line 25012=>now we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and  I will lie down; that <
line 25013=>will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep.' <
line 25014=>     On the right side of  the  bay there  was a great bed on low legs;  not <
line 25015=>igh,  covered  deep in dried grass  and bracken. <
line 25016=>Treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of <
line 25017=>bending at his  middle),  until he lay at full  length, with his arms behind <
line 25018=>his head, looking up at the ceiling. upon which lights were flickering, like <
line 25019=>the  play of leaves  in the sunshine. Merry  and Pippin  sat  beside him  on <
line 25020=>   'Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!' said Treebeard. <
line 25021=>     The hobbits began to tell him the story of their  adventures ever since <
line 25022=>the They followed  no very clear order, for they interrupted <
line 25023=>nother continually, and Treebeard often stopped the  speaker, and  went <
line 25024=>int, or  jumped forward asking questions  about later  <
line 25025=>events. They said  nothing whatever about the Ring, and did not tell him why <
line 25026=>ey  were going to;  and he  did not  ask  for  any <
line 25027=>reasons.  <
line 25028=>     He  was  immensely interested in  everything: in  the  Black Riders, in <
line 25029=>Elrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and  Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of <
line 25030=>, and in Lothlurien  and Galadriel. He made them describe the Shire and <
line 25031=>er  again. He  said an odd thing at  this point.  'You <
line 25032=>never see any, hm, any Ents round  there do you?' he asked. 'Well, not Ents,  <
line 25033=>0say.' <
line 25034=>     'Entwives?' said Pippin. 'Are they like you at all?' <
line 25035=> do  not  really  know   now,  said  Treebeard <
line 25036=>  know   now,  said  Treebeard ly. 'But they would like your country, so I just wondered.' <
line 25037=>     Treebeard  was  however   especially  interested   in  everything  that <
line 25038=>concerned Gandalf;  and  most  interested of  all  in Saruman's  doings. The <
line 25039=>hobbits  regretted  very much that  they  knew so little  about them: only a  <
line 25040=>Sam of what Gandalf had told  the Council.  But they  <
line 25041=>were clear  at  any rate that  UglÂ®k and  his troop  came from Isengard, and <
line 25042=>spoke of Smaster. <
line 25043=> Treebeard,  when at last  their story  had wound and <
line 25044=>wandered  down to the battle of the Orcs  and  the Riders  of Rohan.  'Well, <
line 25045=>well! That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me  all, no <
line 25046=>indeed, not by a long way. But I do not doubt that you a re  doing as Gandalf <

line 25051=>Gandalf takes them  on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras <
line 25052=>e them down all the  leagues  of Wilderland:  indeed <
line 25053=>they seem to be caught up in a great storm. I hope they weather it!' <

line 25056=>'they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards <

line 25059=>on my  side, d me: nobody cares  for the woods as I care for  <
line 25060=>  Elves nowadays. Still,  I  take more kindly to Elves than  to <

line 25069=>ing near.  There is naught that an old Ent can  do to hold back  <

line 25071=>he must weather it or crack. w! Saruman is a neighbour: I cannot overlook him. I must  <

line 25073=>Who is  Saruman?'  asked  Pippin.  'Do  you know  anything  about  his <
line 25074=>a  Wizard,' answered Treebeard.  'More  than  that I <
line 25075=>cannot say. I do not know the history of Wizards. They  appeared first after  <
line 25076=>he Sea; but if they came with  the Ships  I never  <

line 25078=>wandering  abohe  affairs of Men and Elves, some time ago -- <
line 25079=>t a very long time ago: and he settled down at Angrenost, or  <

line 25083=>was nol ways. But at any  rate he used to give no trouble to <
line 25084=>hbours. I used to talk to him.  There was a time when  he was always <
line 25085=> was polite in  those days, always asking my leave <
line 25086=>(at  least when he  met me); and always  eager  to  listen. I told him  many <

line 25088=>imself; but he never repaid me  cannot remember that he ever told.  me anything. And he got <
line 25089=>more and more like that; his face, as I remember  it-I  have not seen it for  <
line 25090=>many  a  day-became  like windows  in  a stone  wall: windows with  shutters <

line 25095=>0is a  black traitor. He has taken up  with  foul folk, with <
line 25096=>the Orcs. Brm,  hoom! Worse than that: he  has been doing something to them; <

line 25100=>what he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of <

line 25102=>     Treebeard  rumbled for a moment, as if he  were pronouncing some  deep, <
line 25103=>bterranean Entish malediction. 'Some  time ago I began to wonder  how Orcs <
line 25104=>gh my woods so  freely,'  he went on. 'Only lately did I <

line 25130=>     He strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain <
line 25131=>of the spring. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the  drops of <
line 25132=>water fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green <
line 25133=>He came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent. <
line 25134=>     After some time the hobbits heard him murmuring  again. He seemed to be <
line 25135=>ingers. 'Fangorn,  Finglas, Fladrif, aye, aye,' he sighed. <

line 25138=>before  the  Darkness: only myself, Fangorn, and  Finglas  and Fladrif  -- to <

line 25145=> on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is <
line 25146=>where the worst  trouble  has been. He was wounded by the Orcs,  and many of <

line 25148=> and destroyed. He has gone up ces, among the birches that he loves  best, and he will not <
line 25149=>come down. Still,  I  daresay I  could get  together a fair company  of  our <
line 25150=>younger folks-if  I could make  them understand the  need: if I could  rouse <
line 25151=>them: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity the re are so few of us!' <

line 25153=> a great many died?' <
line 25154=>     'Oh, no!' said Treebeard. 'None  have died from  inside, as  you  might <
line 25155=>say. Some have  fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of course: and <
line 25156=>wn tree-ish. But  there were never many of us and we have  not <

line 25159=>sad!' said Pippin. 'How was it that they all died?' <
line 25160=>     'They did not die!' said Treebeard. 'I never said died. We lost them, I <
line 25161=>not find them.' He sighed. 'I thought most folk  <
line 25162=>knew that. There were songs about the hunt of the Ents for the Entwives sung <
line 25163=>among  Elves  and  Men  from  Mirkwood  to  Gondor.  They  cannot  be  quite <
line 25164=>forgotten.' <
line 25165=>     'Well, I  am  afraid the songs have not come west over the Mountains to <
line 25166=>. 'Won't you tell us some more, or sing us one of the <
line 25167=>songs?' <
line 25168=>     'Yes, I will indeed,' said Treebeard, seeming pleased with the request. <
line 25169=>'But  I  cannot  tell it properly, only in short; and then  we  must end our <
line 25170=>: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey <
line 25171=>s rather a strange and sad story,' he went on after a pause. 'When <
line 25172=>he woods were  wide  and wild,  the Ents and the <
line 25173=>Entwives  --  and  there  were  Entmaidens  then:  ah!   the  loveliness  of <
line 25174=>Fimbrethil, of Wandlimb the  lightfooted, in the days of our  youth! -- they <
line 25175=>walked  together  and they  housed together.  But our  hearts did not  go on <
line 25176=>ing in the same way: the Ents gave their love to things that they met in <
line 25177=>the world, and the Entwives gave their thought to other things, for the Ents <
line 25178=>loved the great trees; and the wild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; <
line 25179=>tain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees <
line 25180=><
line 25181=>####-let fall in their path;  and they learned of  the Elves and  spoke  with the <
line 25182=>Trees. But  the Entwives gave their  minds to the  lesser trees, and to  the <
line 25183=>meads in the sunshine  beyond the feet of the forests; and they saw the sloe <
line 25184=>d apple and the cherry blossoming in spring, and <
line 25185=>the green herbs in the waterlands in summer, and the seeding grasses in  the <
line 25186=>autumn  fields. They  did  not desire  to  speak with these things; but they <
line 25187=>wished  them to  hear and obey what was said to  them. The  Entwives ordered <
line 25188=>them to  grow  according to  their wishes, and bear leaf and fruit to  their <
line 25189=>es desired order, and plenty, and peace (by which they <
line 25190=>meant that things should remain  where they had set them).  So the  Entwives <

line 25197=>we were only a legend to them, a secret in the heart of the forest. Yet here <

line 25199=>them the Brown Lands now. <
line 25200=>r it was  long ago --  in the time of  the war between Sauron <
line 25201=>0nd the Men of the Sea -- desire came over me to see Fimbrethil  again. Very <
line 25202=>in my eyes, when I had last seen her, though  little like <
line 25203=>the  Entmaiden  of old.  For  the Entwives were bent  and  browned  by their  <
line 25204=>Ælþrched  by the sun to the hue  of ripe corn  and  their <
line 25205=>cheeks  like  red apples.  Yet their eyes were still  the eyes  of  our  own <
line 25206=>people.  W Anduin and came to  their  land:  but  we found a  <

line 25208=>  we called, and long we searched; and we asked <
line 25209=>all  folk  that  we  met which way the Entwives had gone. Some said they had <
line 25210=>0ever seen them;  and  some said that they had seen them walking  away west, <
line 25211=>and some said east, and others south. But nowhere that we went could we find <
line 25212=> Our sorrow was very great. Yet the wild  wood called, and we  returned <
line 25213=>to it. For many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the <
line 25214=>Entwives.  walking far and wide and  calling  them by their beautiful names.  <
line 25215=>  more  seldom and  wandered less far. And now the <
line 25216=>Entwives are only a memory for us, and our  beards  are  long and  grey. The <
line 25217=>Elves made manng the Search of  the  Ents,  and some of  the <
line 25218=>ed into the tongues of  Men. But we made  no songs about it, being <
line 25219=>tiful names when we thought of the Entwives.  We <
line 25220=>believe that we may meet again in  a time to come, and perhaps we shall find <
line 25221=>somewhere  a  land where we can live together and both be content. But it is <
line 25222=>foreboded  that tha t will only be  when we have  both  lost all  that we now <

line 25293=>tmoot.'     He  poured  them  out two  full bowls  from a  stone  jar;  but  from a  <
line 25294=> taste was not the same  as it  had been the night before: <
line 25295=>it was earthier and  richer, more sustaining and  food-like,  so  to  speak. <
line 25296=>While k, sitting on the edge of  the bed, and nibbling small <
line 25297=>f elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a  necessary part <
line 25298=> they  felt  hungry), Treebeard stood,  humming in <
line 25299=>Entish or Elvish or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky. <
line 25300=>here is Entmoot?' Pippin ventured to ask. <
line 25301=>moot?' Pippin ventured to ask. t?' said Treebeard, turning round. 'It is not a  place, <
line 25302=>it  is a  gathering of Ents  --  which does not often happen nowadays.  But I <
line 25303=> fair number  promise to come.  We shall meet in the <
line 25304=>place  where we have always met: Derndingle  Men  call it.  It is away south <
line 25305=>before noon.' <
line 25306=>     Before long they set off. Treebeard carried the  hobbits in his arms as <
line 25307=>on the previous day. At  the entrance to  the court he turned  to the right, <
line 25308=>am, and strode away southwards along  the feet of great <
line 25309=>tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets <
line 25310=>of birch eyond them dark climbing pinewoods.  Soon <

line 25313=>seen before. For a  while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they <
line 25314=>had  noticed when  they  first ventured into Fangorn,  but it  soon  passed. <
line 25315=>Treebeard  did   not  talk  to  them.  He   hummed  to  himself  deeply  and <
line 25316=>thoughtfully,  but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded  like <
line 25317=>oorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar <
line 25318=>boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar ith  a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought <
line 25319=>they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed  to come out of <

line 25322=>     They had been going for a  long while  -- Pippin had tried to keep count <
line 25323=>iled, getting lost at about three thousand -- <
line 25324=>ost at about three thousand -- began to  slacken his pace. Suddenly he  stopped,  put  the <
line 25325=>hobbits down, and raised his curled  hands to his mouth so that they  made a  <
line 25326=> blew or called through them. A great hoom, hom rang out <
line 25327=>like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed  to echo  from the trees.  <
line 25328=>  several directions  a similar  hoom, hom, hoom that <
line 25329=>was not an echo but an answer. <
line 25330=>     Treebeard  now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders  and strode on <
line 25331=>ending out another horn-call,  and each time  the <
line 25332=>answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked <
line 25333=>ark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the <
line 25334=>rees, trees of a kind that the  seen  before:  they branched out right from the roots, and <
line 25335=>were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and  they bore <
line 25336=>many stiff upright flower -spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.  <
line 25337=>     Turning to the  left and skirting this huge hedge  Treebeard  came in a  <
line 25338=>ntrance. Through it a  worn path passed  and dived <
line 25339=>suddenly down  a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending <
line 25340=>into a great  s round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned  <
line 25341=> the high dark evergreen hedge. It  was smooth and  grassclad <
line 25342=>inside,  and  there were no  trees  except  three  very tall  and  beautiful <
line 25343=>t stood at the  bottom  of the bowl.  Two  other paths led <
line 25344=>down into the dingle: from the west and from the east. <
line 25345=> Ents had already arrived.  More were coming  in down the  other  <
line 25346=>paths, and  some were now following Treebeard. As they drew near the hobbits <
line 25347=>  They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like <
line 25348=>Treebeard as  one hobbit is like another (at any  rate to a stranger's eye); <
line 25349=>andmuch surprised to see nothing of the  kind. The Ents were <
line 25350=>fferent from  one another as trees from trees: some as different as one <
line 25351=> of the  same  name  but  quite  different growth and <
line 25352=>history; and some as different  as one tree-kind from another, as birch from <

line 25354=>hale  but  ancient trees (though none looked  as ancient as Treebeard);  and <
line 25355=>s,   clean-limbed  and  smooth-skinned   like <
line 25356=>ed  and  smooth-skinned   like   their  prime; but  there were no young Ents, no  saplings. <
line 25357=>Altogether there were about two  dozen standing on the wide grassy  floor of <

line 25364=>them of beech-trees  or oaks. But  there were other kinds. Some recalled the <
line 25365=>chestnutEnts with large splayfingered hands, and short thick <
line 25366=> recalled  the  ash:  tall straight grey  Ents  with many-fingered <
line 25367=>he fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, <
line 25368=>the  rowan, and the linden.  But when the Ents all gather ed round Treebeard, <
line 25369=>murmuring in  their  slow musical voices, and <
line 25370=>heir  slow musical voices, and  intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw  that they <
line 25371=>were all of the same kindred, and all had  the same eyes: not all so old  or  <
line 25372=>so  deep  as Treebeard's,  but  all  with the  same slow, steady, thoughtful <
line 25373=>expression, and the same green flicker. <
line 25374=>ression, and the same green flicker. mpany was assembled,  standing in a wide circle  <
line 25375=>rd, a curious and unintelligible conversation began.  The Ents <
line 25376=>began to murmur slowly: first  one joined and then  another, until they were <
line 25377=>her in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one <

line 25382=>(and the  chant showed no signs  of  sla ckening) he found himself wondering, <
line 25383=>n 'unhasty'  language,  whether they had yet  got <
line 25384=>further than Good Morning; and if  Treebeard  was to call the roll, how many <
line 25385=>their names. 'I wonder what the Entish is for  <
line 25386=>wonder what the Entish is for  hought. He yawned. <
line 25387=>rd  was immediately  aware  of him. 'Hm, ha, hey, my Pippin!' he <
line 25388=>stopped their chant. 'You are a hasty folk,  I <
line 25389=>ant. 'You are a hasty folk,  I and anyway it is  wearisome listening to a speech you do not <
line 25390=>understand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the Entmoot, <
line 25391=>and <
line 25392=>they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not Orcs, and  that  a  <
line 25393=>new line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that <
line 25394=>is quick work for an Entmoot. You and Merry  can stroll about in the dingle, <
line 25395=>ike.  There is  a well of  good water, if you  need refreshing, away <

line 25398=> the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed  low. This <
line 25399=>feat  seemed  to amuse  the Ents very much, to judge by the  tone  of  their <
line 25400=>e flicker of their  eyes; but they soon turned  back to their <
line 25401=>own  business. Merry  and Pippin  climbed up the path that came in from  the <
line 25402=>hrough the opening in the  great  hedge.  Long  tree-clad <
line 25403=>slopes  rose  from  the  lip of  the dingle, and away beyond them, above the <
line 25404=>st  ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of  a  <
line 25405=>high  mountain.  Southwards to their left they could see the forest  falling <
line 25406=>y distance. There far  away there was a pale green <
line 25407=>glimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan. <
line 25408=>     'I wonder where Isengard is?' said Pippin. <
line 25409=>     'I  don't  know quite where  we are,'  said  Merry;  'but that peak  is <
line 25410=>probably Methedras. and as far  as I can remember the  ring of Isengard lies <
line 25411=>t the end of the  mountains. It  is probably down <
line 25412=>behind this  great ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left <
line 25413=><
line 25414=>     'What  is Isengard like?' said Pippin. 'I wonder what Ents can do a bout <
line 25415=> do I,' said Merry.  'Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or  <
line 25416=>hills, I think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock  in <
line 25417=> Orthanc. Saruman has  a tower  on  it. There  is a gate, <
line 25418=>perhaps  more  than   one, in the encircling wall,  and I  believe there is a  <
line 25419=>lþgh it; it  comes  out  of  the  mountains, and flows on <

line 25424=>happened, I would rather not be on the other side.' <
line 25425=>.  'I  know  what you mean.  There might be  all the <

line 25433=>side of the  dingle  with  a  cool yellow  light.  There they  saw  a little <

line 25438=>of  sun  on the grass and the shadows  of  the <
line 25439=>grass and the shadows  of  the assing over the  floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents <
line 25440=>went on. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and <
line 25441=> that had ever  happened  to  them. A great longing  came <
line 25442=>over them for the faces and voices of their companions. especially for Frodo <

line 25444=>     At last there came  a pause in the  Ent-voices; and looking up they saw <

line 25460=>looked at him, wondering when he would show any signs of 'hastiness'. He was <
line 25461=>tall, and seemed to be one of the  younger Ents;  he had smooth shining skin <
line 25462=>d legs; his lips  were ruddy, and his hair was grey-green. He <
line 25463=>0ould bend and  sway like a slender tree in the wind. At last  he spoke, and <

line 25465=>     'Ha, hmm, my friends, let us go  for a walk!' he said. 'I  am Bregalad, <

line 25472=>of  the hobbits. All that day  they  walked  about in  the  woods with  him, <
line 25473=>singing, and laughing; for Quickbeam  often  laughed. He laughed if the  sun <
line 25474=>, he laughed  if  they came upon a  stream  or  <

line 25494=>where  whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing. Yet there are no  trees <
line 25495=>of all  that race, the people of the Rose, that are  so beautiful to me. And <

line 25497=>and  their red  berries in the  autumn  were  a burden,  and a beauty  and a  <

line 25499=>0d  to  spare. But  the birds became  unfriendly and <
line 25500=>greedy  and tore at the trees, and threw  the fruit down and did not eat it. <
line 25501=>Then  Orcs cad cut down my trees. I came  and called them by <

line 25523=>to a great clamour and then died down again. As the morning wore on the wind <

line 25886=>     The old man took no notice,  but stooped and sat himself on  a low flat <
line 25887=>stone. Then  his grey cloak  drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he <

line 25889=>     'Saruman!' cried Gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand. 'speak! <

line 25899=>into the ain a flash of flame. <

line 25908=>nothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes.  <
line 25909=> the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long <
line 25910=>disused word. 'Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.' <
line 25911=>     He stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it  <
line 25912=>  the  sun had been  shining, but now was  hid  in <

line 25955=>0is knees, and his eyes  were closed. At  last  when <
line 25956=>Aragorn spoke of the death of Boromir and of his last journey upon the Great <
line 25957=>River, the ol    'You have not said  all  that you know or guess, Aragorn my  friend,' he <
line 25958=>r Boromir! I could not see what happened to him. It was  a  <
line 25959=>sore trial  for such a man: a warrior, and a  lord of men. Galadriel told me <
line 25960=>that he was in peril. But  he escaped in the end.  I am glad. It was  not in <
line 25961=>vain that  the  young hobbits  came with us, if only for Boromir's sake. But <

line 25963=>and  their coming  was like  the  falling  of  small stones  that starts  an <

line 25971=>isest  person present to speak lanations needed by the young are wearying.' He laughed, but <

line 25975=>     'What  then shall  I say?'  said Gandalf, and  paused  for a  while  in <
line 25976=>  I  see things at the moment, if you wish  to <
line 25977=>at the moment, if you wish  to my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of course, has long <
line 25978=>known that the Ring  is abroad, and that it is  borne by a  hobbit. He knows <
line 25979=>now the number  of our  Company that set out fr om Rivendell, and the kind of <
line 25980=>each of us.  But he does  not yet  perceive our purpose clearly. He supposes <
line 25981=> to Minas Tirith; for that is what he  would  himself <
line 25982=>have done in our  place. And according to  his wisdom  it would have  been a <
line 25983=>heavy strokwer. Indeed he is in great fear, not knowing what <
line 25984=>may suddenly  appear, wielding the Ring, and assailing him with <
line 25985=>and take his  place. That we  should wish  to <
line 25986=>lace. That we  should wish  to  have no one in his place is not a thought that  occurs  to <
line 25987=>his  mind. That we should try to destroy the Ring itself has not yet entered <
line 25988=>m. In which no doubt you will see our good fortune  and  <
line 25989=>our hope. For imagining war he has let loose war,  believing  that he has no <
line 25990=>r he  that  strikes the  first blow, if he strikes it hard <
line 25991=>enough, may need  to strike no  more.  So the forces that he has  long  been <
line 25992=>Ælþetting in motion, sooner than he intended.  Wise  fool. <
line 25993=>For if he had used all his power to guard Mordor,  so that none could enter, <
line 25994=>and bent to the hunting of the  Ring, then indeed hope would <
line 25995=> neither  Ring nor Bearer could long have eluded him. But now his <
line 25996=>near at home; and mostly he looks towards Minas <
line 25997=>Tirith. Very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm. <
line 25998=>already he knows that the messengers that  he  sent to waylay the <
line 25999=>Company have  failed again. They have not  found the Ring. Neither have they <
line 26000=>y hobbits as hostages. Had they done even so much as that, it <
line 26001=>would have been a heavy blow to us, and it might have been fatal. But let us <
line 26002=>notrts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the <
line 26003=>Tower. For the Enemy has failed-so far. Thanks to Saruman:' <
line 26004=>     'Then is not Saruman a traitor?' said Gimli. <
line 26005=>,' said Gandalf.  'Doubly. And is  not that strange? Nothing <
line 26006=>that  we have endured of  late has seemed  so grievous  as  the  treason  of <

line 26008=>He threatens the Men of  Rohan and draws  off their help from Minas  Tirith, <
line 26009=> approaching from the East. Yet a treacherous weapon <
line 26010=>is ever a danger to the hand.  Saruman also had a mind to capture  the Ring, <
line 26011=>for  himselfto snare  some hobbits for his evil purposes. So <
line 26012=>ur enemies have contrived only to  bring Merry and Pippin with <
line 26013=>marvellous speed, and in the  nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they  <

line 26020=> ill with Saruman.' <
line 26021=>     'It is a pity that our  friends lie in between,' said Gimli. 'If no land <
line 26022=>, then  they could  fight  while we watched  and <
line 26023=>waited.' <
line 26024=>     'The victor would emerge  stronger  than either, and  free from doubt,' <
line 26025=>said  Gandalf.  'But  Isengard  cannot  figh t  Mordor,  unless Saruman first  <
line 26026=>s the Ring. That he will never do now. He does not yet know his peril. <
line 26027=><
line 26028=>####-There is much that he does not know. He was so eager to lay his hands on his <
line 26029=>prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on  <
line 26030=>his messengers. But he came too late, for once,  and the battle was over and <
line 26031=>beyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not  remain here long.  <
line 26032=>nd I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes <
line 26033=>that the horsemen slew and burned all  upon the field of battle; but he does <
line 26034=>not know wheere bringing any  prisoners or not. And  he does <
line 26035=>he  quarrel between his  servants and the Orcs  of Mordor; nor  <
line 26036=>enger.' <
line 26037=>     'The Winged  Messenger!' cried  Legolas. 'I shot at him with the bow of <

line 26047=>Thjoden, Lord of the Mark, should come by  it and learn of its power? That is <
line 26048=>the danger that he  sees,  and  he  has fled  back to Isengard to double and <

line 26057=>     'You  certainly did  not see me, '  answered Gandalf,  'therefore I must  <

line 26060=>ood!' said Gimli. 'I am glad that it was not you.' <
line 26061=>     Gandalf laughed again. 'Yes, my good Dwarf,' he said, 'it is a  comfort <

line 26070=>     'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf.  <
line 26071=>xclaimed  Aragorn. 'Then there is truth in the old legends <
line 26072=>t the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees?  <
line 26073=>Are  there  still  Ents in the  world? I thought they were  only a memory of <
line 26074=> days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of Rohan.' <
line 26075=>     'A legend  of Rohan!' cried  Legolas. 'Nay, every Elf in Wilderland has <

line 26079=>Fangorn into the Common Speech; yet you seem  to  speak of a  person. Who is <
line 26080=> now you are asking much,' said Gandalf. 'The little that I know of <
line 26081=>his long  slow  story would  make  a  tale for which we  have no  time  now.  <
line 26082=>Treebeard  is Fangorn, the  guardian of the  forest; he is the oldest of the <
line 26083=>that still  walks  beneath the Sun  upon  this <
line 26084=>s  beneath the Sun  upon  this  hope indeed,  Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and <
line 26085=>Pippin have been fortunate: they  met  him here, even where  we sit. For  he  <
line 26086=>came here  two days ago  and bore  them away to his  dwelling far off by the  <
line 26087=>roots of the  mountains. He often  comes here, especially  when  his mind is <

line 26089=>ago striding among the trees, and  I  think he saw me, for he  paused; but I <
line 26090=>did not  s heavy with  thought, and  weary after my struggle <
line 26091=> of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.' <
line 26092=>     'Perhaps  he also thought that you were  Saruman,' said Gimli. 'But you  <
line 26093=>he was a friend. I thought Fangorn was dangerous.' <
line 26094=>     'Dangerous!'  cried  Gandalf.  'And  so  am  I,  very  dangerous:  more <

line 26096=> unless you are  brought alive  of the Dark Lord. And Aragorn is dangerous, and Legolas  is <
line 26097=>dangerous. You  are  beset with  dangers,  Gimli  son  of Gluin; for you are <
line 26098=>dangerous yourself,  in your own fashion. Certainly the forest of Fangorn is <
line 26099=>perilous-not  least to those that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn <
line 26100=> too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. But now <
line 26101=><
line 26102=>####-his long slow wrath is brimming over, and all the forest is filled  with it. <

line 26109=>o?' asked Legolas in astonishment.  Gandalf. 'I do not think  they know themselves. I <
line 26110=>wonder.' He fell silent, his head bowed in thought. <
line 26111=>  at him. A gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell <
line 26112=>0nds, which lay now  upturned on his  lap: they seemed to  be filled <
line 26113=>th water. At last he looked up and gazed straight <
line 26114=>at the sun. <
line 26115=>     'The morning is wearing away,' he said. 'Soon we must go.' <
line 26116=>     'Do we go to find our friends and to see Treebeard?' asked Aragorn. <
line 26117=>     'No,' said Gandalf. 'That is not  the road that  you must take. I  have <
line 26118=>spoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory. War is <
line 26119=>   upon us and all  our friends, a war in which only the use  of  the Ring <
line 26120=>could give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow and great <
line 26121=>     fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am Gandalf, <
line 26122=>ck is mightier still.' <
line 26123=>     He rose and gazed out  eastward, shading his eyes, as if he  saw things <
line 26124=> could see. Then he shook his head. 'No,' he  said <
line 26125=>in  a soft voice, 'it has gone beyond our reach. Of that at least let  us be <
line 26126=>ted to use the Ring. We must go down to face a  <
line 26127=>peril near despair, yet that deadly peril is removed.' <
line 26128=>Aragorn son of  Arathorn!'  he said. 'Do  not  regret <
line 26129=>your choice in the valley of the Emyn Muil,  nor call it a vain pursuit. You  <
line 26130=>chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the  choice  was just,  and it <
line 26131=>has  been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met <
line 26132=>our companions is over. Your  next  journey is <
line 26133=>s over. Your  next  journey is iven word. You must go to Edoras and seek out Thjoden in <
line 26134=>his <
line 26135=>hall. For you are needed. The  light of AndÂ®ril must now be uncovered in the <
line 26136=>battle for  which it has so long waited. There is  war in  Rohan,  and worse <
line 26137=>: it goes ill with Thjoden.' <
line 26138=>     'Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?' said Legolas. <

line 26140=>you must go, and hope! To Edoras! I go thither also.' <
line 26141=>     'It is a long  way for  a man to walk, young or old,'  said Aragorn. 'I <

line 26145=>you  will  come  there before me, if you wish.' He rose and  looked  long at <
line 26146=>Gandalzed at them in silence as they stood there facing  one <
line 26147=> The grey figure of the Man, Aragorn son of Arathorn,  was tall, and <
line 26148=>pon the hilt of his sword; he  looked  as  if some <

line 26150=>ure, white; shining now as if with some  light  <
line 26151=>kindled within,  bent, laden  with  years,  but holding a  power beyond  the <

line 26353=>hardly to hs went by. The waxing moon  sank into the  cloudy <
line 26354=> bitter chill came into the air. Slowly in the East the dark  faded to <
line 26355=>s of light leapt  above  the black walls of the Emyn <
line 26356=>Muil  far  away upon  their  left. Dawn came clear and bright; a wind  swept  <
line 26357=>g through the  bent  grasses.  Suddenly Shadowfax <
line 26358=>stood still and neighed. Gandalf pointed ahead. <
line 26359=> they lifted their tired eyes. Before them stood <
line 26360=>the mountains  of  the South:  white-tipped  and  streaked  with black.  The <
line 26361=>grass-lands  rolled against  the  hills  that clustered  at their feet,  and <
line 26362=>flowed up into many valleys still  dim and  dark, untouched  by the light of <
line 26363=>,  winding  their way into the heart of the great mountains. Immediately <
line 26364=> the widest of these  glens  opened  like a  long gulf <
line 26365=>among the hills. Far inward they  glimpsed a tumbled mountain -mass with  one <
line 26366=>0of  the  vale there  stood  like  sentinel a lonely <
line 26367=>height. About its feet  there flowed, as a thread of silver, the stream that <
line 26368=>s brow they caught, still  far away, a glint in <
line 26369=>the rising sun, a  glimmer of gold. 'Speak, Legolas!' said Gandalf. 'Tell us <
line 26370=>what you see there before us!' <
line 26371=>     Legolas  gazed  ahead, shading  his eyes from the  level shafts  of the <
line 26372=>new-risen  sun. 'I see a  white stream  that comes down from  the snows,' he  <
line 26373=>. 'Where it issues  from the shadow  of the vale a green hill rises upon <
line 26374=> and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it. Within  there <
line 26375=>rise the  roofs of houses; and in the midst, set upon a green terrace, there <
line 26376=>eat  hall of Men. And it  seems to  my eyes  that it  is <

line 26380=>asleep.' Edoras  those courts are called,' said Gandalf, 'and Meduseld  is that <

line 26387=>     The  morning was  bright and clear about them, and birds were  singing, <
line 26388=>when the  travellers came to the stream. It ran down swiftly into the plain, <
line 26389=>hills  turned across their path in a wide bend, <
line 26390=>flowing away east to  feed the Entwash far off in  its reed-choked beds. The <
line 26391=>land was green: in the wet meads and along  the grassy borders of the stream <
line 26392=>grew many willow-trees. Already in this southern land they were blushing red <
line 26393=>at  their fingertips. Feeling  the approach of spring. Over the stream there <
line 26394=> banks  much trampled by the  passage of horses.  The <
line 26395=>travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the <
line 26396=>uplands.  <

line 26398=>mounds, high and green. Upon their western sides the grass was white as with <

line 26492=>limbing in  short  flights of well-laid  steps.  Many <

line 26508=>long stair under the eyes of the tall  watchmen. Silent they stood now above  <
line 26509=>and spoke no  word, until Gandalf stepped  out upon the paved terrace at the <
line 26510=>stairs head. Then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting  <

line 26512=>swords towards the travellers in token of  peace. Green  gems flashed in the <
line 26513=>sunlight.  Then one of the guards stepped forward  and  spoke in  the Common <

line 26540=>darkly up at the  guard, as if he were a young tree that Gimli had a mind to <
line 26541=>fell. 'Not alone!' <
line 26542=>     'Come, come!' said Gandalf. 'We are all friends here. Or should be; for  <

line 26572=>inwards grumbling on  their great hinges. The travellers entered. Inside  it <
line 26573=>seemed  dark and warm after the clear air  upon the hill.  The hall was long <
line 26574=>and wide and filled  with shadows and half lights; mighty pillars upheld its <
line 26575=>there bright  sunbeams fell  in glimmering  shafts <
line 26576=>from  the  eastern windows, high under the deep eaves. Through the louver in <
line 26577=>the roof, abov  of  issuing smoke,  the sky showed  pale and <
line 26578=> eyes changed, the travellers  perceived  that the floor was <
line 26579=>paved  with  stones  of  many  hues;  branching  runes  and strange  devices <
line 26580=> their feet. They  saw now that  the pillars were richly <
line 26581=>carved,  gleaming dully with gold and half-seen  colours.  Many woven cloths <
line 26582=>were hunls,  and over their  wide spaces  marched figures of <
line 26583=>gend, some  dim with years,  some darkling in the shade. But  upon <
line 26584=>a young man upon a white horse. He was blowing a  <

line 26590=>he Field of Celebrant.' our companions  went forward, past the clear wood-fire burning <
line 26591=>upon the long hearth in  the midst of the hall. Then they halted. At the far <
line 26592=>beyond the hearth and facing north towards  the doors, was <
line 26593=>a dais with three steps; and  in the  middle of the dais was a great  gilded <
line 26594=><
line 26595=>####-at a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but <
line 26596=>his white  hair was  long and thick and fell  in great braids from beneath a  <

line 26598=>a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his <
line 26599=>th  a bright  light,  glinting  as  he  gazed at  the <
line 26600=>strangers. Behind his  chair  stood  a woman clad in white. At his feet upon <

line 26602=>eyes.  <
line 26603=>. The old  man  did not move in his chair. At length <
line 26604=>Gandalf spoke.  'Hail, Thjoden son of Thengel!  I have returned. For behold!  <

line 26606=>singly be destroyed.' <
line 26607=>n rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon a short black  <
line 26608=>staff  with a handle of  white bone; and now  the strangers  saw that,  bent <
line 26609=>though he was, he was still tall and must in youth  have been high and proud <
line 26610=>indeed. <
line 26611=>     'I greet you,'  he said,  'and maybe you look for welcome. But truth to <
line 26612=>tell your welcome is  doubtful here,  Master Gandalf.  You have ever  been a  <
line 26613=>d  of  woe. Troubles follow you like crows,  and ever  the oftener  the <
line 26614=>worse. I will  not deceive  you: when I heard that Shadowfax had  come  back <
line 26615=>0, I rejoiced at the return of the horse, but still more at the lack  <
line 26616=>of the rider; and when Jomer brought the  tidings that you  had gone at last <
line 26617=> home, I did not mourn. But news from afar is seldom sooth. Here <

line 27359=>staring moment the watchers  on the walls saw all the space between them and <

line 27361=>uat and broad, some  tall and grim, with high helms and sable <

line 27382=>     Then at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them,  and a hail of <
line 27383=>stones. They  wavered, broke, and fled  back; and  then charged again, broke <
line 27384=>  again; and each time, like  the incoming sea, they  halted at a  <
line 27385=> rang, and a press of roaring  men leaped forth.  <
line 27386=>They held their great shields  above them like a roof, while in  their midst <

line 27426=>s the gates within. Come now!'  At  that  moment some dozen Orcs that  had  lain <
line 27427=>motionless among  the slain  leaped  to their feet,  and  came  silently and <

line 27653=>some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Orcs laughed with loud voices; <

line 27655=>down. <
line 27656=>     There  was a roar and a blast of  fire. The archway  of the gate  above <

line 27663=>sudden and terrible, from the  tower above, the sound  of the great horn  of <
line 27664=>Helm rang out. <
line 27665=>     All that heard that sound trembled. Many of the Orcs cast themselves on <

line 27694=>slopes lapping  the ever -mounting hills,  there  now a forest  loomed. Great <
line 27695=>ood, rank on  rank, with tangled bough and hoary <
line 27696=>head;  their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass. Darkness was <
line 27697=>under them. Between the  Dike and the eaves of that  nameless wood only  two <
line 27698=>open furlongs lay.  There now cowered  the proud hosts of Saruman, in terror <

line 27700=>until all above the Dike was  empty  of them, but below it they were  packed <
line 27701=>like swarming flies.  Vainly they crawled and clambered about  the walls  of <

line 27703=>valley's side; upon the left, from the west, their final doom approached. <
line 27704=>     There suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in <
line 27705=>the rising  sun.  Over  the low hills  the horns were  sounding. Behind him, <
line 27706=>hastening down the long slopes,  were a  thousand  men on foot; their swords <
line 27707=>id them strode a man tall and strong.  His shield was <
line 27708=>red. As he came to the valley's brink, he set to his lips a great black horn <
line 27709=>and blew a      'Erkenbrand!' the Riders shouted. 'Erkenbrand!' <

line 28229=>white. It was stained as with dried blood; and looking closer they perceived <
line 28230=>d.  Unheeding  Gandalf rode  on  into  the mist,  and <
line 28231=>reluctantly  they followed him. All about them now,  as if  there had been a  <
line 28232=>of water lay beside the road, filling the hollows.  <
line 28233=>and rills went trickling down among the stones.  <

line 28236=>of noon had passed. They were come to the doors of Isengard. <
line 28237=>d and twisted  on the ground.  And  all about, <
line 28238=>n the ground.  And  all about, and  splintered into  countless jagged shards, was scattered <
line 28239=>far and wide, or piled in ruinous heaps. The great arch  still stood, but it <
line 28240=>opened now upon a roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare.  and through the <
line 28241=>like walls  on  either side great  rents  and  breaches had been torn; <
line 28242=>their towers were beaten into  dust. If the Great Sea had risen in wrath and <
line 28243=>fallen on the hills with storm. it could ha ve worked no greater ruin. <
line 28244=>   The ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron, in <
line 28245=> and floated  a wreckage of beams and  spars, chests and <
line 28246=>casks and broken  gear. Twisted and leaning pillars reared their  splintered <
line 28247=>but all the roads were drowned. Far off, it  seemed, <
line 28248=>half veiled in  winding cloud, there loomed the  island rock. Still dark and <
line 28249=>tall, unbrok  the tower of Orthanc stood. Pale waters lapped  <
line 28250=>t. <
line 28251=>ompany  sat silent on  their horses, marvelling, <
line 28252=>perceiving  that the power of Saruman was overthrown; but how they could not <
line 28253=>guess.  And  now they turned their eyes towards the archway  and  the ruined <
line 28254=> saw close  beside  them a great rubble-heap; and suddenly <
line 28255=>they were aware  of two small figures  lying on it at their ease, grey-clad, <
line 28256=>Ælþmong  the  stones. There were  bottles and  bowls  and <
line 28257=>platters  laid beside them, as if  they had just eaten  well, and now rested <
line 28258=>from theirmed asleep; the other, with crossed legs  and arms <
line 28259=>ead,  leaned  back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth <
line 28260=> thin blue smoke. <

line 28264=>became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent  on the edge of  the <

line 28266=>much  more than half a man  in height; his head  of  brown curling hair  was <

line 28271=>     'Welcome, my lords,  to  Isengard!' he said. 'We  are  the doorwardens. <

line 29079=>     'Well?' it  said now with  gentle  question. 'Why  must  you disturb my <

line 29082=>tonished, for they had heard no sound of his coming; <
line 29083=>they saw a figure standing at the  rail, looking  down upon them: an old <

line 29086=>with  a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the <
line 29087=>look  that they now  bore was grave and benevolent, and a  little weary. His <

line 29440=>in the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey  ruins falling into <

line 29492=>the mists were gone. A  chill wind blew. The moon, now  waxing round, filled <
line 29493=>the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen.  The  shoulders of  the mountain  to <

line 29498=>  the northern ranges,  greenfooted,  crowned  with <

line 29509=>P curiously restless. The bracken cracked and rustled, as he <
line 29510=>twisted and turned. <
line 29511=>     'What's the matter?' asked Merry. 'Are you lying on an ant-hill?' <
line 29512=>     'No,'  said Pippin, 'but  I'm not  comfortable. I wonder how long it is <

line 29519=>were riding with Gandalf.' <
line 29520=>     'Well, what of it?' <
line 29521=>     'Did you get any news, any information out of him?' <
line 29522=>     'Yes, a good deal. More than usual. But you heard it all or most of it: <

line 29524=>tomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him-and if he'll have you.' <

line 29556=>-have-it so-go-to-sleep!'  could  I say?' said Merry. 'I'm sorry, Pippin, but you  <
line 29557=>really must wait  till the  morning.  I'll  be as curious as you  like after  <
line 29558=>breakfast, and I'll  help in any  way I can at wizard-wheedling. But I can't  <

line 29561=> was not  encouraged by  the  sound of Merry breathing softly, asleep in a  <
line 29562=>saying good night. 'The thought of  the dark globe seemed <
line 29563=>to grow stronger as all grew quiet.  Pippin felt  again its  weight  in  his <

line 29566=>     At last he could stand it no longer. He got up and looked round. It was <
line 29567=>d  his cloak about him.   The  moon was shining cold and <
line 29568=>white, down into  the  dell, and  the shadows of the bushes were black.  All <
line 29569=> shapes. The  two guards were not in view: they were up on <
line 29570=>the hill, perhaps, or hidden in the bracken. Driven by some  impulse that he <
line 29571=>ippin  walked  softly to  where Gandalf lay. He looked <
line 29572=>down at him. The wizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there <
line 29573=>der his long  lashes. Pippin stepped back hastily. <
line 29574=>But  Gandalf  made no sign;  and drawn forward once more, half  against  his <
line 29575=>n from behind the wizard's head. He was rolled <
line 29576=>e wizard's head. He was rolled ith  his cloak  spread over  the  top; and close beside him, <
line 29577=>between his right  side and  his  bent arm,  there was a hummock,  something <
line 29578=>round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off  <
line 29579=>it to the ground. <
line 29580=>ing, Pippin  crept nearer, foot by  foot. At last he knelt <
line 29581=>. Then he put his hands out  stealthily, and slowly  lifted the lump up: <
line 29582=>  so heavy as he  had  expected. 'Only some  bundle of <
line 29583=>oddments, perhaps, after all,'  he thought  with  a strange sense of relief;  <
line 29584=>0ndle down again. He stood for a moment clasping it . <
line 29585=>Then an idea came into his mind.  He  tiptoed away, found a large stone, and  <
line 29586=>w he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and kneeling <
line 29587=>down, laid it back by the wizard's hand. Then at last he looked at the thing <
line 29588=>ed. There it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and <
line 29589=>dead, lying bare before his knees. Pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in <
line 29590=> turned to go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf <
line 29591=>moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed  to be in a strange <
line 29592=>t  and clasped the  wrapped stone, then he sighed  <
line 29593=>and did not move again. <
line 29594=>fool!' Pippin muttered  to himself. 'You're going  to get <
line 29595=>yourself into frightful  trouble. Put it back quick!'  But he found now that <
line 29596=>his knees  quaked, and he did not  dare to  go  near enough to the wizard to <
line 29597=>reach  the  bundle.  'I'll never get  it back  now without  waking  him,' he <
line 29598=>thought, 'not till I'm a bit calmer. SÂ¢ I may as well have a look first. Not <
line 29599=>hough!'  He stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not  far <
line 29600=>in over the edge of the dell. <
line 29601=>     Pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball  between  them. He bent <
line 29602=>low over it, looking like a greedy  child stooping over a bowl of food, in a  <
line 29603=>corner away from  others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at  it. The  air <
line 29604=> about him. At first the globe was dark, black as jet, <
line 29605=>th the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then ther e came a faint glow and <
line 29606=>f it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look  <
line 29607=>away. Soon all  the inside  seemed on fire;  the ball  was spinning,  or the <
line 29608=>lightsvolving. Suddenly the lights went out.  He gave a gasp  <
line 29609=>uggled; but  he  remained bent,  clasping the ball  with  both hands.  <
line 29610=>t, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly <
line 29611=>for a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still. <
line 29612=>     The cry was  piercing. The guards  leapt down from  the banks.  All the <
line 29613=>   'So this is the thief!' said Gandalf.  Hastily  he cast his  cloak over  <
line 29614=>thet lay.  'But  you, Pippin!  This is a  grievous  turn  to <
line 29615=>things!' He knelt by  Pippin's body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid, <
line 29616=>ing up at the sky. 'The devilry! What mischief has he  <
line 29617=>done-to himself, and to all of us?' The wizard's face was drawn and haggard.  <
line 29618=>0d and bent over his face, listening for his breath; <
line 29619=>then he laid  his hands on his brow.  The hobbit shuddered. His eyes closed.  <
line 29620=> staring in bewilderment at all the  faces round <
line 29621=>him, pale in the moonlight. <
line 29622=>0or you, Saruman!' he  cried in a shrill and toneless  voice <
line 29623=>shrinking away from Gandalf. 'I will send for it at once. Do you understand?  <
line 29624=>Say just that!' Then he struggled to get up and escape but Gandalf held  him <
line 29625=>gently and firmly. <
line 29626=>k!' he said. 'Come back!' <
line 29627=>     The  hobbit relaxed  and  fell  back,  clinging  to  the wizard's hand. <
line 29628=>andalf! Forgive me!' <
line 29629=>     'Forgive you?' said the wizard. 'Tell me first what you have done!' <
line 29630=>     'I, I  took  the  ball  and looked at it,' stammered Pippin; 'and I saw <
line 29631=>things that frightened me. And I wanted to go away, but I couldn't. And then <
line 29632=>he came  and questioned  me; and  he looked  at me, and,  and  that is all I <
line 29633=>remember.' <
line 29634=>     'That won't  do,' said Gandalf sternly. 'What did you see, and what did <

line 29636=>him in  silence, except Merry who turned away. But  Gandalf's face was still  <
line 29637=>aid. <
line 29638=>oice Pippin began again, and slowly his words grew <
line 29639=>clearer  and  stronger. 'I saw a  dark sky, and tall battlements,' he  said. <
line 29640=>med very far away and long ago, yet hard and  clear. <
line 29641=>Then the stars went in and out-they were  cut off by things with wings. Very <

line 29643=>the tower. I  thought  there  were nine of them.  One  began to fly straight <

line 29649=>     'I did not answer. He said: "Who are you?" I still did not answer,  but <

line 29651=>sed me, so I said: "A hobbit."  seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. It was cruel. <
line 29652=>It was like being  stabbed with knives. I struggled.  But  he sa id: "Wait  a  <
line 29653=>moment!  We shall meet again soon. Tell Saruman  that this dainty is not for  <

line 29658=>'t remember anything else.' . t into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze for a  <
line 29659=>moment  in silence. Then  his face grew  gentler, and the shadow  of a smile <
line 29660=>appeared. He laid his hand softly on Pippin's head. <
line 29661=>     'All right!' he said. 'Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no <

line 29971=>yet heavy with an odour of cold decay.  `Well,' he said, at last withdrawing <
line 29972=>0 here all night, fix or no fix. We must find a more <
line 29973=>sheltered spot,  and camp once more; and perhaps another  day will show us a <

line 29975=>We've come the wrong way.' <
line 29976=>     'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'It's my  doom, I think, to go  to  that Shadow <

line 29993=>'     They turned  away and went down into a  stony hollow. The westering sun <
line 29994=>was caught into clouds,  and night came swiftly. They slept as  well as they <
line 29995=>could  for the  cold, turn and  turn about,  in a  nook among  great  jagged <
line 29996=>rock; at  least they were sheltered from the easterly <

line 29998=>     `Did you see them  again, Mr . Frodo?' asked Sam, as they sat, stiff and <
line 29999=>afers of  lembas, in the cold grey of early morning. <
line 30000=>     'No,' said Frodo. `I've heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two nights <

line 30018=>they heard  no more,  nothing but  the  wind sighing over  the  edges of the <
line 30019=>inded them of breath softly hissing through sharp <
line 30020=>teeth. <
line 30021=>     All that  day  the  outer  ridge of the  Emyn  Muil  had  been  bending <

line 30023=>stretched  a wide tumbled flat of scored and  weathered rock,  cut  every now  <
line 30024=>0gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in  <
line 30025=>the cliff-face. To find a path in  these clefts, which  were becoming deeper <
line 30026=>nd Sam were driven to their left, well away from <
line 30027=>the edge, and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going <
line 30028=>slowly but steadily downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of <
line 30029=>  At last  they were brought to a  halt.  The ridge took  a  sharper bend <
line 30030=>nor tshed by  a deeper  ravine. On the further side it reared <
line 30031=>up again,  many fathoms at a single  leap: a great grey cliff  loomed before <
line 30032=> if by  a  knife stroke.  They could  go  no further <
line 30033=>forwards, and must turn now either west or east. But west  would  lead  them <
line 30034=>elay, back towards the  heart of the hills; east <

line 30039=>     'A nasty drop, I'll bet,' said Sam. <
line 30040=>said Sam.     The  cleft  was  longer and deeper  than it seemed. Some way down  they <
line 30041=>d and stunted  trees,  the first they  had seen for days: <
line 30042=>twisted birch for  the  most part, with here and there a fir -tree. Many were <

line 30047=>gh with broken stone and slanted steeply  down. <
line 30048=>When they came at last to the end of it, Frodo stooped and leaned out. <
line 30049=>     `Look!' he said. `We must have come down a  long way, or else the cliff <
line 30050=>0 here than it was, and it looks easier too.' <
line 30051=> was, and it looks easier too.' ide  him  and peered  reluctantly over the  edge.  Then he <
line 30052=>ced up at the great  cliff rising up, away on  their left. `Easier! ' he <
line 30053=>pose it's always easier getting down than up. Those as <
line 30054=>can't fly can jump!' <
line 30055=>a big jump still,' said Frodo. `About, well'  --  he  stood <
line 30056=>for a moment measuring it with his eyes  -- `about eighteen  fathoms I should  <
line 30057=>guess. Not more.' <
line 30058=>     'And that's enough! ' said Sam. `Ugh! How I do hate looking down from a <
line 30059=>height! But looking's better than climbing.' <
line 30060=> than climbing.'  `All the same,' said Frodo, `I think  we could climb here; and  I think  <
line 30061=>lþ See -- the rock is quite different from  what it was a  <
line 30062=>few miles back. It has slipped and cracked.' <
line 30063=>s back. It has slipped and cracked.'   indeed no  longer  sheer,  but  sloped outwards  a  <
line 30064=>little. It looked  like a great rampart or  sea -wall whose  foundations  had <
line 30065=>ses were all twisted and disordered, leaving great <
line 30066=>fissures  and  long  slanting edges that were in places  almost as  wide  as <
line 30067=>stairs. <
line 30068=>     `And if we're going to try and  get down, we had better  try  at  once. <
line 30069=>It's getting dark early. I think there's a storm coming.' <
line 30070=>     The smoky  blur of the mountains  in the  East  was  lost  in a  deeper  <
line 30071=>blackness that was already reaching out  westwards with long arms. There was <
line 30072=>a distant  mutter of  thunder borne on the rising breeze. Frodo sniffed  the <
line 30073=><
line 30074=>####-air and looked up  doubtfully at the  sky. He strapped his belt  outside his <
line 30075=>cloak  and  tightened it, and settled  his  light pack on  his back; then he <

line 30077=>     `Very good! ' said Sam gloomily. `But I'm going first.' <
line 30078=>     'You? ' said Frodo. `What's made you change your mind about climbing?' <
line 30079=>0y mind.  But it's only sense: put the one lowest as <
line 30080=>is most  likely to slip. I don't want to come down atop of you a nd knock you  <
line 30081=> with one fall.' <
line 30082=>     Before Frodo  could  stop  him,  he  sat down,  swung his legs over the <
line 30083=>brink,  and twisted round, scrabbling with  his toes for a  foothold.  It is <
line 30084=>doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood, or more unwise. <
line 30085=>     'No,  no! Sam, you  old ass! ' said Frodo.  `You'll kill  yourself  for  <
line 30086=>certain goiat without  even a look to see what  to make for. <
line 30087=> He took Sam under  the armpits and hauled him up  again. 'Now,  <

line 30090=>sun had not yet set. 'I think we  could manage this,' he  said presently. `I  <

line 30092=>carefully.' <
line 30093=> you can be so sure,' said Sam. `Why! You can't see to <
line 30094=>the bottom in this light. What if you comes to a place where there's nowhere <
line 30095=>ands?' <
line 30096=>ose,' said Frodo. <
line 30097=>     'Easy said,' objected Sam. 'Better wait till morning and more light.' <
line 30098=>     `No! Not if I can help it,' said Frodo with a sudden strange vehemence. <
line 30099=>r, every minute. I'm  going down to try it out.  Don't you  <
line 30100=>follow till I come back or call!' <
line 30101=>'      Gripping  the stony lip of  the  fall with  his fingers he  let himself <
line 30102=> when his arms were almost at full stretch, his toes found <
line 30103=>a ledge.  'On_ e step down!  ' he  said. 'And this ledge broadens out to the <
line 30104=>here without a hold. I'll--' his words were cut short. <
line 30105=>     The  hurrying  darkness, now gathering  great speed, rushed up from the <
line 30106=>. There was a dry splitting crack of thunder right  <
line 30107=>overhead. Searing  lightning smote down into the hills. Then came a blast of <
line 30108=>ngling with its  roar, there came a high shrill <
line 30109=>shriek. The hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the Marish as they <
line 30110=>fled  from Hobbiton, and even there  in the woods of the Shire it had frozen <
line 30111=> Out  here  in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced <
line 30112=>r and despair, stopping heart and breath. Sam <
line 30113=>stopping heart and breath. Sam face. Involuntarily Frodo loosed his hold and put his hands <
line 30114=>over his head and ears. He swayed,  slipped,  and slithered downwards with a <
line 30115=>wailing cry. <
line 30116=>     Sam  heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge. 'Master, master! <
line 30117=>0 <
line 30118=>found he was  shaking all over, but he gathered  <
line 30119=>his breath, and once again he shouted: 'Master!' The wind seemed to blow his <
line 30120=>voice back into his throat, but as it passed, roaring up  the gully and away <
line 30121=>over the hills, a faint answering cry came to his ears:  <
line 30122=>ht! I'm here. But I can't see.' <
line 30123=>t! I'm here. But I can't see.'   weak voice. ,He  was not actually very  far <
line 30124=>0 and not fallen, and had come up with a jolt to his feet on <
line 30125=>ider ledge not  many yards lower down. Fortunately  the  rock -face at this <
line 30126=>point leaned well back and  the  wind had pressed him against the  cliff, so <
line 30127=>he had not toppled  over. He steadied himself a little, laying his face <
line 30128=> feeling  his heart pounding. But either the darkness <
line 30129=>had  grown  complete, or else  his eyes had lost  their sight. All was black  <
line 30130=>he had been struck blind. He took a deep breath.  <
line 30131=>     `Come  back!  Come  back! '  he heard Sam's voice out  of the blackness <
line 30132=>. `I  can't see. I can't find any hold. I can't  move <
line 30133=>yet.' <
line 30134=>     `What  can  I do, Mr. Frodo? What can I do?  ' shouted Sam, leaning out <
line 30135=>y could not his master see?  It was dim, certainly,  but <
line 30136=>not as dark as all that. He could see Frodo below him, a grey forlorn figure <
line 30137=>ff. But  he was far out of the  reach of any helping <
line 30138=>hand. <
line 30139=>     There  was another crack  of  thunder;  and then  the  rain came.  In a  <
line 30140=>led with hail, it drove against the cliff, bitter cold. <
line 30141=>     'I'm  coming  down to you,' shouted Sam, though how he hoped to help in <
line 30142=>0e said. <
line 30143=>' Frodo  called back, more strongly now. `I  shall be <
line 30144=>better  soon. I feel  better already. Wait! You can't do anything  without a  <
line 30145=>d  Sam, talking wildly to himself  in  his  excitement and <

line 30148=>You're nowt  but a ninnyhammer, Sam Gamgee: that's  what <

line 30150=>Gaffer said to me often enough, it being a word of his. Rope!' <
line 30151=>     `Stop  chattering!' cried  Frodo,  now  recovered  enough to feel  both <
line 30152=> 'Never mind your Gaffer! Are you trying to tell yourself <
line 30153=>you've got some rope in your pocket? If so, out with it! <
line 30154=>     `Yes, Mr. Frodo, in my pack and  all.  Carried it hundreds of miles and <

line 30156=>get busy and let an end down!' ng  his pack and rummaged in it. There indeed at the <
line 30157=>bottom was a coil  of the silken-grey rope made by the folk  of  Lurien.  He <
line 30158=>cast an end to his master. The darkness seemed to lift from Frodo's eyes, or  <
line 30159=>else his sight was returning. He could see the grey line as it came dangling <
line 30160=>aint silver sheen. Now that he had some point  <
line 30161=>n. Now that he had some point  to  fix his eyes on, he felt less giddy. Leaning  his weight <
line 30162=>rward, he made the  end fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line <
line 30163=>    Sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from <

line 30167=>falling heavily. The hobbits crawled away back into the gully; but  they did <

line 30174=>remember them putting the  ropes in the boats,  as we started  off:  in  the <
line 30175=> a fancy to it, and  I stowed a coil in my pack. Years <

line 30181=> long is your rope, I wonder?' asuring it with his arms: 'Five, ten, twenty, <
line 30182=><
line 30183=>, more or less,' he said. <
line 30184=>     'Who'd have  thought it!' Frodo exclaimed. <
line 30185=> ' said Sam. `Elves are wonderful folk. It looks  a  bit <
line 30186=>thin, but it's tough; and soft as milk to the  hand. Packs close too, and as <
line 30187=>light as light. Wonderful folk to be sure!' <
line 30188=>rful folk to be sure!' y ells! '  said Frodo considering. 'I believe it would be enough. <
line 30189=>If the storm passes before nightfall, I'm going to try it.' <
line 30190=>     `The rain's nearly  given over already,'  said Sam;  'but  don't you go <
line 30191=>ky in the  dim again, Mr.  Frodo! And I  haven't  got over <
line 30192=>that shriek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a Black Rider it  sounded-but <
line 30193=>they can fly.  I'm  thinking we'd  best lay up in this <
line 30194=>crack till night's over.' <
line 30195=>     'And I'm  thinking that I won't spend a moment longer than I need stuck  <
line 30196=>of the Dark Country looking over the marshes,' <
line 30197=>try looking over the marshes,'   With  that he stood up and went  down to the bottom of the gully again. <
line 30198=> sky  was  growing in the East once more. The skirts of <
line 30199=>the  storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the  main  battle had passed to <
line 30200=>spread its great wings over the Emyn  Muil; upon which  the dark thought  of <
line 30201=>Sauron brooded for a  while.  Thence it turned, smiting  the Vale of  Anduin <
line 30202=>d  casting its shadow upon  Minas  Tirith  with <
line 30203=>.  Then,  lowering in the mountains,  and gathering its great <
line 30204=>0pires,  it rolled on slowly over Gondor  and the skirts of Rohan, until far <
line 30205=> the plain saw its black towers mov ing behind the sun, as <
line 30206=>they  rode into the West. But here, over the desert and the  reeking marshes <
line 30207=>  evening  opened once  more, and  a few  pallid stars <
line 30208=>appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent moon. <
line 30209=>see again,' said Frodo,  breathing  deep. `Do <
line 30210=>d Frodo,  breathing  deep. `Do ht for a  bit that I had lost my sight? From  the lightning <
line 30211=>or something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey <
line 30212=>rope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow.' <
line 30213=>o shimmer somehow.' `It does look  sort of silver in the dark,' said Sam. `Never noticed it <
line 30214=>before, though I can't remember as I've ever had it out since I first stowed <
line 30215=>it. But if you're so set on climbing, Mr. Frodo,  how  are you  going to use <
line 30216=>it?  Thirtyabout eighteen fathom: that's  no  more than your <
line 30217=>height of the cliff.' <
line 30218=>     Frodo thought for a while. `Make it fast to that stump, Sam! ' he said. <
line 30219=>hall have your wish this time and go first. I'll  lower  <
line 30220=>you, and you need do no more than use  your feet and hands  to fend yourself <

line 30222=>me a  rest, it will help. When you're down, I'll follow. I feel quite myself <
line 30223=>,' said Sam heavily. `If it must be, let's get it  over! ' He <
line 30224=>took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest  to the brink; then <
line 30225=> tied about  his own waist.  Reluctantly  he  turned  and <
line 30226=>prepared to go over the edge a second time. <
line 30227=> to go over the edge a second time. , turn  out half as bad as he had expected. The rope <
line 30228=>seemed  to give him confidence, though he  shut his eyes more than once when <
line 30229=>he looked down between his feet. There was one awkward spot, where there <
line 30230=>the wa ll was sheer and even undercut for  a short  space; there <
line 30231=>the silver  line. But Frodo lowered him slowly <
line 30232=>. But Frodo lowered him slowly d  it was over at  last. His  chief  fear had been  that the <
line 30233=>rope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a  <
line 30234=>good bight in Frodo's hands, when Sam came to the bottom and called up: `I'm <
line 30235=>down! ' His voice came up clearly from below,  but Frodo could not see  him; <
line 30236=>his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight. <
line 30237=>     Frodo took rather  more time to follow him. He had the  rope  about his <
line 30238=>t above, and he had shortened it so that it  would pull <
line 30239=>him up before  he  reached the ground; still he did not want to risk a fall, <
line 30240=>0's faith in  this   slender grey line.  He found two <
line 30241=>places, all  the  same,  where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces <
line 30242=>  for  his strong hobbit  fingers and the ledges <
line 30243=>were far apart. But at last he too was down. <
line 30244=>oo was down.      `Well!' he cried.  `We've done it! We've escaped from the Emyn Muil! And <
line 30245=>0 wonder? Maybe we shall soon  be sighing for good hard rock  <
line 30246=>under foot again.' <
line 30247=>     But   Sam  did   not  answer:  he  was   staring  back  up  the  cliff.  <
line 30248=>dles! My beautiful rope! There it is tied to a  <
line 30249=>'re  at the  bottom.  Just  as  nice a little stair for  that <
line 30250=>slinking Gollum as we could leave. Better put up a signpost to say which way <
line 30251=>ht it seemed a bit too easy.' <
line 30252=>     `If you can think of any way  we could have both used the rope and  yet <

line 30562=>way akin and not alien: they could reach one another's  minds. Gollum raised <
line 30563=> Frodo, fawning at his knees. <
line 30564=>     'Down! down! ' said Frodo. `Now speak your promise!' <

line 30732=>away,  nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched <

line 30836=>er-courses.  Among  these  a cunning eye  and  foot  could <

line 30852=>journey,  and they  rested,  squatting  like  little hunted animals, in  the <
line 30853=> reed-thicket. There was  a   deep silence, only <

line 30862=>shadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on <
line 30863=>ef halts. These  they made not  so much for rest as  to <
line 30864=>help Gollum;  for now  even he had to go forward with great care, and he was <

line 30867=>d   slowly,  stooping,  keeping  close  in  line,  following <
line 30868=>attentively  every move that  Gollum made.  The fens grew more  wet, opening <
line 30869=>into  wide stagnant meres, among which it grew  more and more  difficult  to <
line 30870=>find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking  into gurgling <
line 30871=>mud. The travellers were  light, or maybe none of them would ever have found <
line 30872=>ugh. <
line 30873=>     Presently it  grew  altogether  dark: the air  itself seemed  black and <
line 30874=>athe. When lights appeared Sam  rubbed his eyes: he  thought his <
line 30875=>t  saw one with the corner of his  left eye, a  <
line 30876=>wisp  of pale sheen that faded away;  but  others appeared soon  after: some <
line 30877=>like dimly shining smoke,  some  like  misty flames flickering  slowly above <
line 30878=>unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets  unfurled by <
line 30879=>n hands. But neither of his companions spoke a word. <
line 30880=>     At  last  Sam could bear it  no longer. `What's all this, Gollum? '  he <
line 30881=>ghts? They're all  round us now. Are we trapped?  <
line 30882=>Who are they? ' <
line 30883=>rk water was before him, and he was crawling  on <
line 30884=>the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. 'Yes, they are all round <
line 30885=>us,' he whispered. 'The tricksy lights. Candles  of corpses, yes, yes. Don't <
line 30886=>you heed them! Don't look! Don't follow them! Where's the master? ' <
line 30887=>ed back and found that Frodo had lagged again. He could not see <
line 30888=>ack into the darkness,  not daring to move far,  or  <
line 30889=>to call in more than a  hoarse  whisper. Suddenly he stumbled against Frodo, <
line 30890=>ught, looking at the pale lights. His hands hung <
line 30891=>stiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them. <
line 30892=> Frodo!  ' said Sam.  'Don't look at  them!  Gollum says  we <
line 30893=>mustn't. Let's keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as <
line 30894=>  ' <
line 30895=>o,  as if returning out of a dream.  'I'm coming. <
line 30896=>Go on!  ' <
line 30897=>     Hurrying forward again, Sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root <
line 30898=>l  and came heavily on  his hands, which  sank deep into <
line 30899=>sticky ooze,  so that his  fa ce was brought close to the surface of the dark <
line 30900=> hiss, a noisome smell went up, the  lights flickered <
line 30901=>and danced and swirled.  For a moment the water  below him  looked like some <
line 30902=>lass, through which he was  peering. Wrenching <
line 30903=>ich he was  peering. Wrenching of the  bog, he sprang  back  with a cry. 'There are dead things,  <
line 30904=>dead faces in the water,' he said with horror. 'Dead faces! ' <
line 30905=>d Marshes,  yes, yes: that is their names,'  he <
line 30906=>cackled. `You should not look in when the candles are lit.' <
line 30907=>? What are they? ' asked Sam shuddering, turning to Frodo, <
line 30908=>who was now behind him. <
line 30909=>     'I don't know,' said Frodo in a dreamlike voice. 'But I have seen  them <
line 30910=>too. In the pndles were lit. They lie in all the pools, pale <
line 30911=>p under the dark water. I saw  them: grim faces and evil, and <
line 30912=>noble faces and sad. Many faces  proud and fair, and weeds  in their  silver  <
line 30913=>l, all rotting, all  dead. A fell light is in them.' Frodo <
line 30914=>hid  his eyes in his hands.  'I  know not who they are; but I thought I  saw <
line 30915=>nd Orcs beside them.' <
line 30916=>     `Yes, yes,' said Gollum. `All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and Orcs.  <
line 30917=>The  Dead  Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him <
line 30918=>when Smjagol was young, when I was young  before the Precious came. It was <
line 30919=>a <
line 30920=> long swords, and terrible  Elves,  and  Orcses <
line 30921=> fought on  the plain for days and months at the Black Gates.  <
line 30922=>But  the  Marshes have grown since  then,  swallowed up the  graves;  always <
line 30923=>.' <
line 30924=>ge and more ago,'  said Sam. 'The Dead can't be really <
line 30925=>there! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land? ' <
line 30926=>0 Smjagol doesn't  know,'  answered Gollum. 'You cannot reach <
line 30927=>them,  you  cannot touch them. We tried once, .yes,  precious. I tried once; <
line 30928=> them. Only  shapes  to see, perhaps, not  to  touch. No <
line 30929=>precious! All dead.' <
line 30930=> darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed <
line 30931=>why Smjagol  had tried to touch them. `Well, I don't  want to  see them,' he <
line 30932=>said. 'Never again! Can't we get on and get away? ' <
line 30933=>     `Yes,  yes,' said  Gollum. `But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully! Or <
line 30934=>0to  join the Dead  ones  and light  little  candles. Follow <
line 30935=>Smjagol! Don't look at lights! ' <
line 30936=>'     He  crawled away to the  right, seeking for a path round the mere. They  <
line 30937=> stooping, often using their hands even as he  did. 'Three <
line 30938=>precious  little Gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,' <
line 30939=>last they came to the  end of the black  mere, and  they crossed it, <
line 30940=>perilouslyhopping  from  one  treacherous island tussock  to <
line 30941=>another. Often they floundered, stepping or  falling hands-first into waters <
line 30942=>ll  they were slimed and  fouled almost  up to <
line 30943=>imed and  fouled almost  up to stank in one another's nostrils. <
line 30944=>     It was la  when at  length  they reached  firmer ground <
line 30945=>again.  Gollum hissed  and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was <
line 30946=>pleased: in some mysterious way,  by some blended  sense of feel, and smell, <
line 30947=>or shapes  in  the dark, he seemed to know just where he <
line 30948=>was again, and to be sure of his road ahead. <
line 30949=>n, and to be sure of his road ahead. he  said.  'Nice  hobbits! Brave  hobbits! Very very <
line 30950=>weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take master  <
line 30951=>away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.' With these words he started <
line 30952=>off again, almost  at a trot,  down what  appeared to be a long lane between <
line 30953=>after him  as quickly as they could. But in a  <
line 30954=>ickly as they could. But in a  stopped suddenly and sniffed the  air doubtfully, hissing as <

line 30957=>to  sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and <
line 30958=>e stinks.' <
line 30959=>Sam stinks! ' answered Gollum. `Poor Smjagol  smells it, <
line 30960=><
line 30961=>####-but good  Smjagol bears  it. Helps nice master. But  that's no  matter.  The <
line 30962=>ge is coming. Smjagol wonders; he's not happy.' <
line 30963=> again, but his uneasiness grew, and  every  now and again he <
line 30964=>stood  up to his full height, craning his neck eastward and  southward.  For <
line 30965=>its could not  hear  or feel what was troubling him. Then <
line 30966=>suddenly all  three  halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo  and  Sam it <
line 30967=>d, far away, a  long  wailing cry, high and  thin and <
line 30968=>cruel.  They shivered. At  the same  moment the stirring  of the  air became <

line 30970=>ears,  they heard a noise  like a  wind coming  in  the distance.  The misty <

line 30972=>ve. He stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until <
line 30973=>with a rush the wind came upon  them, hissing and snarling over the marshes.  <

line 30975=>shapeless drifts of fog,  curling and  twisting  as it rolled over them  and <
line 30976=>w the clouds breaking and shredding; and then <
line 30977=>eaking and shredding; and then  the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack. <
line 30978=>     For a moment the sight of  it  gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but <
line 30979=>Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and  <
line 30980=>he sky, breathing deeply of the  fresher  air, saw  it come:  a  <
line 30981=> accursed hills; a  black  shadow loosed  from <
line 30982=> a  black  shadow loosed  from shape winged and ominous. It  scudded  across the  moon, and <
line 30983=>with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed. <
line 30984=>     They fell  forward, grovelling  heedlessly on the cold earth.  But  the <
line 30985=>shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing  lower now, right above them, <
line 30986=>sweeping the  fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then  it was gone, flying <
line 30987=>rdor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind <
line 30988=>ad Marshes bare and bleak. The naked  waste,  as <

line 30992=>evil dream to find the familiar  night still over the world. But Gollum  lay <

line 30994=>and for some time  he  would not  lift  his  face, but knelt forward on  his <
line 30995=>s head with his large flat hands.  <

line 31006=> to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said <
line 31007=>nothing.  indeed he  hardly  spoke  at all; and  he did not complain, but he <
line 31008=>0es a load, the  weight of which is ever increasing; <
line 31009=>and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum <
line 31010=>r master behind. <
line 31011=>     In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring <
line 31012=>on  its chain about his neck grow  more burdensome.  He was now beginning to <
line 31013=>feel  it as an actual  weight  dragging him earthwards.  But far more he was <
line 31014=>troubled by the Eye: so he called it to  himself. It was that more  than the <
line 31015=>drag omade him cower  and stoop as he walked. The Eye:  that <
line 31016=>  growing sense of a  hostile will  that  strove with great power to <
line 31017=>ud, and earth, and  flesh, and to see you: to  pin <
line 31018=>you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the <

line 31024=>his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring <
line 31025=>grovelling  promise made half in the fear of  cold <

line 31032=>the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder, <

line 31041=>which  memory could  find   nothing  to  rest upon.  For two more nights they <

line 31048=>miles away. Frodo looked round  in horror. Dreadful as the Dead  Marshes had <

line 31080=>Frodo and Sam crawled  after him, until  they came to a wide almost circular <
line 31081=>pit, high-banked upon the west. It was  cold and dead, and  a foul  sump  of <
line 31082=> ooze lay at its bottom.  In  this evil hole they cowered, <
line 31083=>hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye. <
line 31084=>     The  day passed  slowly. A  great thirst troubled  them, but they drank  <

line 31086=>they looked back in thought seemed to  them a place of peace and beauty. The <

line 31088=>ired as they  were, neither of at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow <
line 31089=>moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to bc on  guard. He lay back on <
line 31090=>the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense  of burden that was on <
line 31091=>him. He looked  up at the  smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark <
line 31092=>0  out of the past. He  lost count of time, hovering <
line 31093=>between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him. <

line 31218=>of the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward  from <
line 31219=>its mouth were two  sheer  hills, black -boned and bare. Upon  them stood the <
line 31220=>towers strong and  tall. In days long past they  were <
line 31221=>built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power,  after the overthrow of <
line 31222=> he  should seek to return to his old realm.  But <
line 31223=>the strength of Gondor  failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers <

line 31225=>atch-towers, which  had fallen re  repaired, and  filled  with arms,  and  garrisoned  with <

line 31228=>     Across the  mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff,  the Dark Lord  had <

line 31251=>of Barad-dyr. Another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor;  and <

line 31287=>must come.' <
line 31288=>     Sam said nothing.  The look on Frodo's face was enough for him  he knew <
line 31289=>. And after all he never had any real hope  in <
line 31290=>he never had any real hope  in the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed <

line 31296=>     Gollum, however, did not  intend to  be  got rid  of, yet. He knelt  a t <

line 31318=>e, found it hard  to believe that the long submerged  Smjagol  <
line 31319=>had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the <
line 31320=>ss was that  the Smjagol and Gollum halves (or what in his <
line 31321=>own mind he called Slinker  and Stinker) had made  a  truce and a  temporary <
line 31322=>ted  the Enemy to get the Ring;  both  wished to  keep <
line 31323=>Frodo from capture, and under their  eye, as long as possible -- at any rate <
line 31324=>ad  a  chance  of laying hands  on his 'Precious'. <
line 31325=>Whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted. <
line 31326=>     `And it's a good thing neither half  of the old villain don't know what <
line 31327=>t. `If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put <

line 31330=>orders  of some kind from him, or was  -- that he'd give us away rather than <

line 31336=>through Sam's slow  but  shrewd  mind, he  stood gazing out towards the dark <
line 31337=>or. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved <
line 31338=>in the side of a  low  hill, at some  little height above  a long trenchlike <
line 31339=>it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. In the  <

line 31345=>entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where  he stood. <
line 31346=>Weright, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains,  <
line 31347=>  went off southwards into  the deep shadows that mantled all the western <

line 31353=>####-most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and <
line 31354=>wastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets;  <
line 31355=>and over the levels beside  the roads horsemen could be seen  riding in many  <
line 31356=>companies.  He  remembered his  vision from afar upon Amon Hen,  so few <
line 31357=>days <
line 31358=>many years ago. Then he knew that the hope that <
line 31359=>d  moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not  <
line 31360=>rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark Lord by <
line 31361=> risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long <
line 31362=>passed away. These were Men  of  other  race, out  of  the  wide  Eastlands, <
line 31363=>ons of their Overlord; armies that had encamped before <
line 31364=>his  Gate by  night  and  now marched in to swell  his mounting power. As if <
line 31365=> of the  peril  of their  position, alone,  in the <

line 31377=>     `Yes, yes,  master!  '  said Gollum. `Dreadful  danger! Smjagol's bones <

line 31407=>on the floor and begged them both to be kind to `poor little Smjagol'. After  <

line 31451=> that help us?  ' asked  Sam. `Surely the Enemy knows all <
line 31452=>about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as th is? The  <

line 31459=>     `So  that's your advice  is it,' said Sam, 'that  we  should go another  <
line 31460=>long march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one,  when we <
line 31461=>get there, if we ever do? ' <
line 31462=>     `No,   no  indeed,'  said  Gollum.  `Hobbits  must  see,  must  try  to <
line 31463=>ot expect attack that way. His Eye is all round, but it <

line 31471=>Or just hobnobbing with Orcs? ' obbit,  not sensible,'  said Gollum, giving Sam  an  angry <

line 31503=>     'It's  a lie! ' hissed Gollum, and an evil light came into  his eyes at <

line 31507=>ll you. I did escape.' <
line 31508=>     Frodo felt a  strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once <
line 31509=>not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a <
line 31510=>way out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. For  <
line 31511=>llum used  I, and that  seemed usually to be  a  <
line 31512=>sign, on its rare appearances. that some remnants of old truth and sincerity <
line 31513=>were  for  the moment on top. But even  if Gollum  could  be trusted on this <
line 31514=>ot forget the wiles  of the  Enemy. The 'escape' may  have  <

line 31517=>     'I ask you again,' he said: `is not this secret way guarded? ' <

line 31527=>ld them that name  and its  significance: Gandalf  would have <
line 31528=>warned  them. But they  were  alone, and Aragorn was  far away, and  Gandalf <
line 31529=>stood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason. <
line 31530=>Yet even  as he spoke his last words to Saruman, and the palantnr crashed in <
line 31531=>Orthanc. his thought was ever upon Frodo and Samwise, <

line 31534=>0andalf was  gone, gone  for ever into the shadow in <
line 31535=>Moria far  away. He  sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his  head <
line 31536=>all  all that Gandalf had  said to him. But  for this <
line 31537=>choice he could recall no counsel. Indeed Gandalf's guidance had  been taken <
line 31538=>oon, while the Dark Land was still very far away. <
line 31539=>How they should enter it at the last  Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could <

line 31542=>Barad-dyr, since the Dark Lord  rose in power again, had  he ever   journeyed <
line 31543=>there?  Frodo did not think  so. And here he was  a little halfling from the <
line 31544=>Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where <
line 31545=>ot go, or dared not go. It was an evil  fate. But he <
line 31546=>had  taken it   on himself in his  own sitting-room in the far-off spring  of <
line 31547=>ow that it was like a chapter  in a story  of the <

line 31551=>ay drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little  grey hollow where <
line 31552=>orders of the land of fear: a silence that could <
line 31553=>be felt, as if it  were a  thick veil that cut  them off from all the  world <
line 31554=>about them. Above them was a dome  of pale sky  barred  with fleeting smoke, <
line 31555=> and far away. as if seen through great deeps of air heavy <
line 31556=>with brooding thought. <
line 31557=>     Not even an eagle  poised  against the sun would have marked the hobbits <
line 31558=>ght of doom, silent, Âµ not moving, shrouded  in <
line 31559=>their  thin  grey  cloaks. For a moment he  might  have  paused  to consider  <
line 31560=>ing  on  the ground:  there  perhaps  lay the <
line 31561=>ound:  there  perhaps  lay the  of some child of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to  <
line 31562=>it, its long arms and legs almost bone -white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a  <
line 31563=>s head  was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands <
line 31564=>behind  his ht of his hood at the empty sky.  At least for a  <
line 31565=>long while it was empty. Then presently Sam thought he saw a  dark bird-like <
line 31566=>figure wheel into the circle of his  sight, and hover, and  then wheel  away <
line 31567=>ollowed,  and then a fourth. They were very  small to look <
line 31568=>at,  yet  he knew,  somehow, that  they  were huge,  with a  vast stretch of <
line 31569=>great height.  He covered his eyes and  bent  forward, <
line 31570=>cowering. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of <
line 31571=>less horror that had come with the cry in the wind <
line 31572=><
line 31573=>####-and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: <
line 31574=>emote.  But menace  it was. Frodo  felt it  too. His <

line 31579=>said in a hoarse whisper. 'I saw them. Do you think they  could see us? They <
line 31580=>hey are Black Riders same as  before, then they <
line 31581=>can't see much by daylight, can they?  ' <
line 31582=> can they?  ' 'No, perhaps not,' said Frodo.  `But their steeds  could see. And these <
line 31583=>hey ride on now, they can probably  see more than any <
line 31584=>other  creature.  They are like great  carrion birds. They  are  looking for  <
line 31585=> the watch, I fear.' <
line 31586=>     The feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding  silence was broken. For  <
line 31587=>some  time  they had been cut  off  from  the  world, as if  in an invisible <
line 31588=>island; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned.  But  still Frodo <
line 31589=>e h is choice. His eyes were closed, as if  he <
line 31590=>is eyes were closed, as if  he r looking  inward into his  heart  and memory.  At  last  he <
line 31591=>stirred  and  stood up,  and  it seemed that  he was  about to  speak and to <
line 31592=>he said. `What is that?' <
line 31593=>     A new  fear  was upon  them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At <
line 31594=>first it seemed a long way off,  but it drew  nearer:  it was coming towards <
line 31595=>them. It leaped into all their minds that the Black Wings had spied them and <
line 31596=>eize  them: no speed seemed too great  for these <
line 31597=>terrible servants of Sauron.  They  crouched, listening.  The voices and the <
line 31598=>clink  of weapons and harness were very close.  Frodo and Sam loosened their <

line 31601=>Very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch,  until he could peer over it <
line 31602=>between  two  broken points of stone. He remained there without  moving  for  <
line 31603=>g no sound.  Presen tly the voices began to recede again, and <
line 31604=>then they slowly faded away. Far off  a  horn  blew on  the ramparts of  the <
line 31605=>Morannon. Then quietly Gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow.  <
line 31606=>     'More  Men  going to Mordor,' he said in a low  voice. `Dark faces.  We <

line 31695=>could at a little distance.  At last, when  night  was growing old and  they <

line 31791=>that went  quickly down before them. Presently  it  brought them to a  small <
line 31792=>ll: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone <

line 31835=>drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper,  or a breakfast, by <
line 31836=>the fire  in  the old kitchen  at  Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An  <
line 31837=>idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun  to sneak off <
line 31838=>on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern. <
line 31839=>d Sam. `Where are you going?  Hunting? Well see here, <
line 31840=>old  noser, you don't like our  food,  and I'd  not  be sorry  for  a change <
line 31841=>myself.  Your new motto's always ready to help . Could you find anything  fit <
line 31842=>for a hungry hobbit? ' <
line 31843=> yes,' said Gollum. `Smjagol always helps, if they  asks <
line 31844=>-- if they asks nicely.' <
line 31845=>     `Right!' said Sam `I does ask. And if that isn't nice enough, I begs.' <
line 31846=>     Gollum disappeared.  He  was away some  time, and  Frodo  after  a  few <
line 31847=>0as settled deep into the brown  fern and went to sleep. Sam <
line 31848=>looked  at  him. The early  daylight  was only just creeping  down into  the <
line 31849=>shadows u nder the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and  his <
line 31850=>hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly <
line 31851=>of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in  the  house of Elrond,  after his  deadly <
line 31852=>n as  he  had  kept watch Sam  had  noticed that at times  a light <

line 31858=>that  way to himself.  He shook  his  head, as if finding words useless, and <
line 31859=>murmured:  `I  love  him. He's  like that, and  sometimes it shines through, <
line 31860=><
line 31861=>####-somehow. But I love him, whether or no.' <
line 31862=>e him, whether or no.' um returned quietly  and  peered over  Sam's  shoulder.  Looking at <
line 31863=>Frodo, he shut his eyes  and crawled away without a sound. Sam came  to him a  <
line 31864=>r and found him  chewing something  and muttering  to himself. <
line 31865=>On <
line 31866=>the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was  beginning to  eye <
line 31867=>  'Smjagol always helps,' he said. `He has brought rabbits, nice rabbits.  <
line 31868=>  to sleep,  and perhaps Sam wants to sleep. Doesn't want <
line 31869=>rabbits now?  Smjagol  tries  to help,  but he can't catch  things all in  a  <
line 31870=>minute.' <
line 31871=>     Sam,  however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least <
line 31872=>not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of  course,  can cook, for they  begin to <
line 31873=>fore their letters (which  many never reach):  but Sam was a  <
line 31874=>good  cook, even by  hobbit  reckoning,  and he had  done a good deal of the <
line 31875=>camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a  chance. He  still  hopefully <
line 31876=>carried some of his gear in his pack: a  small tinder -box, two small shallow <
line 31877=>pans,  the smaller fitting into  the  larger; inside them  a wooden spoon, a  <
line 31878=> two-pronged  fork and  some skewers were  stowed;  and hidden  at the <
line 31879=>flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But <
line 31880=>a  fire, and other things besides. He thought for  a bit, while he <
line 31881=> and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits.  <
line 31882=>He was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes. <

line 31886=>want all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.' <
line 31887=>     'Never you mind,' said Sam. `If you  can't guess, you'll soon find out. <
line 31888=>the  water,  the  sooner you'll  learn. Don't you  <
line 31889=>damage one of my pans, or I'll carve you into mincemeat.' <

line 31891=>sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck  most  by the leanness  of his face <
line 31892=>and drawn he is,' he muttered. 'Not right for a hobbit. <
line 31893=>If I can get these coneys cooked, I'm going to wake him up.' <
line 31894=>     Sam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled  up the bank  <
line 31895=>igs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a  cedar <
line 31896=>at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the <
line 31897=>rn-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid  his fuel <
line 31898=>in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It  <
line 31899=> gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping  <

line 31916=>He clawed a t the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire. <

line 31924=>himself with his pans. `What a hobbit needs with coney,' he said to himself,  <

line 32021=>     At  once  four  men  came  striding  through  the  fern from  different <

line 32024=>ds. <

line 32028=>st of their  own height,  and   long green-feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides,  <

line 32146=>watchfu by the edge of the fern-brake, peered  out. With his <

line 32156=>back into deeper shade. `He  stands  a fair chance of being spitted  for  an <
line 32157=>Orc,  or of being roasted  by the Yellow Face. But I  fancy he'll look after  <
line 32158=>himself.' He lay down beside Frodo and began to doze. <

line 32161=>rns rang out louder and beyond  mistake from  above, over the <
line 32162=>top  of  the slope. Sam thought that he heard cries and wild  shouting also, <
line 32163=>faint,  as  if  it came out  of some  distant  cave. Then <
line 32164=>presently the noise of  fighting broke  out  near at hand, just  above their <

line 32173=>hem, and the Captain leading.' ee more, went now and joined the guards. He scrambled a <
line 32174=>little  way  up into one of  the  larger of the bay-trees. For  a  moment he <
line 32175=>caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running  down the slope  some way off <
line 32176=>with green-clad warriors leaping after them, hewing them down  as they fled. <
line 32177=>. Then suddenly straight over  the rim of their <
line 32178=>, a man fell, crashing through  the slender trees,  nearly on <
line 32179=>top of them. He came to  rest in the  fern a  few feet away,  face downward, <
line 32180=>s  sticking from  his neck  below  a  golden collar.  His <
line 32181=>scarlet robes  were tattered, his  corslet of overlapping brazen  plates was <
line 32182=>k plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with <
line 32183=>blood. His brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword. <

line 32187=>what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of <

line 32189=>and if  he would not really rather have stayed there in peace-all in a flash <
line 32190=>ckly driven  from his mind. For  just as  Mablung <
line 32191=>stepped towards the  fallen  body, there was a  new noise.  Great crying and <
line 32192=> shrill bellowing or trumpeting.  And  then a  <
line 32193=>g or trumpeting.  And  then a  nd bumping. like huge rams dinning on the ground. <
line 32194=>     'Ware! Ware!' cried Damrod  to his  companion. 'May the Valar turn  him <

line 32196=>     To his  astonishment and terror,  and lasting delight,  Sam  saw a vast  <
line 32197=>0rees  and come careering down the  slope. Big as  a  <

line 32202=>atter days are but memories of esty. On  he came, straight towards  the watchers, and then <
line 32203=>swerved  aside in the nick of time,  passing only  a few yards away, rocking  <
line 32204=>the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like <
line 32205=>ears  spread out, long  snout upraised like a huge serpent  about to strike. <
line 32206=>g. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands <
line 32207=>of  gold and dripped with blood. His trappings of  scarlet and  gold flapped <
line 32208=>he  ruins  of  what seemed a very war -tower  lay <
line 32209=>upon his heaving back, smashed in his furious passage thr ough the woods; and <

line 32211=>mighty warrior, a giant among the Swertings. <
line 32212=>he Swertings.     On the great  beast  thundered, blundering  in blind wrath through pool <

line 32214=>his flanks. Men of  both sides  fled before him,  but  many  he overtook and <
line 32215=>d. Soon he was lost  to  view, still  trumpeting  and <
line 32216=>stamping far away. What became of him Sam never heard: whether  he escaped <
line 32217=> until he perished far from his home or was trapped <
line 32218=>in some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the Great River  <
line 32219=>Sam drew a  deep breath. 'An Oliphaunt it  was!' he said. `S o there are <

line 32223=>     'Sleep while you  may,' said Mablung. `But  the Captain will return, if <

line 32233=> <
line 32234=>     It seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke <

line 32236=>many men  with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray  were now gathered <
line 32237=>0  or  three  hundred  strong.  They sat in  a  wide <
line 32238=>semicircle,  between the  arms  of which Faramir was  seated  on the ground,  <
line 32239=>him.  It looked strangely  like the  trial  of a  <
line 32240=>prisoner. <
line 32241=>     Sam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any  attention to him, and <
line 32242=> the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear <
line 32243=>all that wa s  going on. He  watched and listened  intently, ready to dash to <
line 32244=>eeded. He  could see  Faramir's face,  which  was now <
line 32245=>unmasked:  it  was  stern  and commanding, and  a keen  wit lay  behind  his <
line 32246=> in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo. <
line 32247=>     Sam soon became aware that  the Captain was not satisfied  with Frodo's <
line 32248=>account of  himself at several  points:  what part  he  had  to  play in the <
line 32249=>ut from Rivendell; why he had  left Boromir; and where he <
line 32250=>was now going. In particular he returned often to Isildur's Bane. Plainly he <
line 32251=>ealing from him some matter of great importance. <
line 32252=>     'But  it  was at the coming of the Halfling  that Isildur's Bane should <
line 32253=>waken,  or so  one must  read the words,' he  insisted. `If then you are the <
line 32254=> named,  doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may <
line 32255=>be, to the Council of which you speak, and there Boromir saw it. Do you deny <
line 32256=>e no answer. 'So! ' said Faramir. `I  wish then  to learn from <
line 32257=>you more of it; for  what  concerns Boromir concerns  me. An orc-arrow  slew <
line 32258=> old tales tell. But orc-arrows are plenty,  and the sight <
line 32259=>of one would not be taken as a  sign of Doom by Boromir of  Gondor.  Had you  <
line 32260=>g?  It is hidden, you say;  but is not that because you  <
line 32261=>choose to hide it? ' <
line 32262=>cause I choose,' answered Frodo. `It  does not belong to me. <
line 32263=>It does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any  could claim <
line 32264=>it, it would  be Aragorn son  of Arathorn, whom  I named, the  leader of our <

line 32269=>Isildur himself. And the sword  that he  bears was Elendil's <
line 32270=>sword.' <
line 32271=>     A  murmur of  astonishment ran through all the ring  of men. Some cried  <
line 32272=>0 of Elendil! The  sword  of Elendil comes  to Minas Tirith!  <
line 32273=>Great tidings! ' But Faramir's face was unmoved. <
line 32274=> said. `But so great a claim will need to be established and <
line 32275=>clear proofs  will  be  required,  should this  Aragorn ever  come  to Minas <

line 32287=>it did not appease Faramir. <
line 32288=>     `So!' he said. `You bid me mind my own  affairs,  and get me back home,  <

line 32290=>nd of Boromir?' <
line 32291=>fore Frodo's  mind came the memory  of Boromir's assault upon <
line 32292=>him, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir's eyes watching him grew harder. <
line 32293=>'Boromir was a valiant member of our Company ' said Frodo at length. 'Yes, I <
line 32294=>was his friend, for my part.' <
line 32295=>     Faramir smiled grimly. `Then you would grieve to learn that  Boromir is <
line 32296=>dead?  ' <
line 32297=>     'I  would  grieve  indeed,'  said  Frodo.  Then catching  the  look  in <
line 32298=>Faramir's eyes, he faltered. 'Dead?'  he said. `Do you mean that he is dead, <
line 32299=>it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with <
line 32300=>me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?' <
line 32301=>     `I would not snare even an orc with a falsehood,' said Faramir. <
line 32302=>     `How then did  he die, and how do  you know of  it? Since  you say that <

line 32320=>t of  their Captain sitting on eye to eye with  a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling <

line 32347=>brother  in  looks, was a man less self-regarding, both <
line 32348=>sterner and wiser. 'I remember that Boromir bore a horn,' he said at last. <

line 32613=>at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to  all  the soft  <

line 32615=>name of Gollum had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was <

line 32652=>one by  the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo and Sam knew of  this <
line 32653=> they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little <
line 32654=>they found that  they were  on a  path descending  steeply; soon  it grew so <

line 32659=>running water  was  on their right hand, and it grew  nearer and louder.  At <

line 32661=>several times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed  upwards a  <

line 32666=> their  feet once  more. For a moment they stood so, <
line 32667=>half fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no one spoke. <
line 32668=>     Then came the voice of Faramir close behind. `Let  them see! ' he said. <

line 32673=>veil  of water was hung, so  near that Frodo cou ld  have put an outstretched <
line 32674=>0faced westward. The level shafts  of the setting sun behind <
line 32675=>beat  upon it, and the red  light was broken  into many flickering  beams of <
line 32676=>r. It  was as if  they  stood  at  the  window  of  some <
line 32677=>elven-tower, curtained with threaded  jewels  of silver and  gold, and ruby, <

line 32684=>     Even as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water.  <
line 32685=>They  turnedr  the low forbidding  arch. At  once they found <
line 32686=>a rock -chamber, wide and rough, with an  uneven stooping roof.  <
line 32687=>nd cast a dim  light on the  glisten ing walls.  <
line 32688=>Many men were already there. Others were  still coming in by twos and threes <

line 32691=>filled with gr eat store of arms and victuals.  <

line 32697=>the rocks  far above.  All the ways  into this grot were then sealed against  <

line 32699=>out:  that passage yonder by which you entered  blindfold,  and  through the  <

line 32702=>   The hobbits  were taken to a corner and given a  low bed to lie on,  if <
line 32703=>le  men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in <
line 32704=>orderly  quickness. Light  tables  were taken from the walls and  set  up on <
line 32705=> gear .  This was plain and unadorned  for  the  most <
line 32706=>part,  but  all well and fairly,  made:  round platters, bowls and dishes of <
line 32707=> box-wood, smooth and clean. Here and there was a  <
line 32708=>cup or basin of polished bronze; and a goblet of plain  silver was set by the <
line 32709=>of the inmost table. <
line 32710=>     Faramir went about  among the men, questioning each as he came in, in a  <
line 32711=>soft  voice. Some came back from the pursuit of  the Southrons; others, left  <
line 32712=>behind as scouts near the roa d, came in latest. All  the Southrons  had been <
line 32713=>  great mymak:  what happened to him none could <
line 32714=>my no movement could be seen; not even an orc-spy was <
line 32715=>abroad. <
line 32716=>     'You saw and heard nothing, Anborn?' Faramir asked of the latest comer. <
line 32717=>rd,' said the man. `No Orc at least. But I saw, or thought <
line 32718=>I saw,  something a little strange. It was getting deep dusk, when the  eyes <
line 32719=>an they should be. So perhaps it may have been no more <
line 32720=>than a squirrel.' Sam pricked up  his ears at this.  'Yet if  so,  it  was a  <

line 32722=>whisked behind a tree-trunk when  I drew  nigh and went up aloft as swift as <

line 32724=>and it  seemed  no  more, so I  tried  no arrow.  It was too  dark for  sure <
line 32725=>shooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a <

line 32727=>hastened back. I  thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as  I <

line 32732=>     `Perhaps,' said Faramir. `But that would be an ill omen, if it were so. <
line 32733=>of Mirkwood in Ithilien.'  Sam  fancied that he  <
line 32734=>gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he  spoke; but Sam  said nothing.  <
line 32735=>ack and watched the torchlight, and  the  men <
line 32736=> the torchlight, and  the  men ro  speaking in  hushed  voices. Then  suddenly  Frodo fell  <

line 32741=>what  can  I do, if I do  keep  awake, me all alone, and all these great Men <
line 32742=>; but you've got to keep awake  all the same.' And <
line 32743=>somehow he managed it. The light faded from the cave door, and the grey veil <
line 32744=>was lost in gathering shadow. Always the sound <
line 32745=>ering shadow. Always the sound t on, never changing its note, morning or evening  or night.  <
line 32746=>It murmured and whispered of sleep. Sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes. <
line 32747=>     Now more torches  were being  lit. A cask of wine was broached. Storage <
line 32748=>barrels were being opened. Men were  fetching water from the fall. Some were <
line 32749=>ins. A  wide copper bowl and  a white cloth were <

line 32757=>head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears.  <
line 32758=>     'Is it the custom  in  your land to wash the head before supper? ' said <
line 32759=>the man who waited on the hobbits.  <

line 32763=> a bit.' y were led then to seats beside Faramir: barrels  covered with pelts <
line 32764=> benches of the Men  for their convenience. Before <
line 32765=>they ate,  Faramir  and all  his  men turned  and faced west in  a moment of <

line 32767=> that they should do likewise. ' he  said, as they sat down: `we look towards NÂ®menor <

line 32769=>Elvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such custom at meat? ' <
line 32770=>     `No,' said  Frodo,  feeling  strangely rustic and untutored. `But if we <
line 32771=>are guests, we bow to  our host, and  after we have eaten we rise  and thank <

line 32778=>  hands and clean  knives  and Frodo  nor  Sam  refused  anything that was  offered,  nor a  <
line 32779=>second, nor indeed a  third helping.  The  wine coursed in their  veins  and <
line 32780=>tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since <
line 32781=>left the land of Lurien. <
line 32782=>     When all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, <

line 32793=>     Frodo no longer felt  sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the <
line 32794=>food and wine had put  him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. Sam <
line 32795=>was beaming  and humming  to himself, but when  Frodo  spoke he was at first  <
line 32796=>occasionally venturing  to  make an exclamation of <
line 32797=>agreement. <
line 32798=>     Frodo told many tales,  yet always he  steered the matter away from the <
line 32799=>ny and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part <
line 32800=>Boromir had played in all their adventures. with the  wolves of the wild, in <
line 32801=>hras, and in  the  mines of Moria  where Gandalf fell.  <
line 32802=>Faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge. <
line 32803=>     `It must have irked Boromir to  run  from Orcs,' he said, `or even from <
line 32804=>,  the  Balrog  -- even  though he was the  last  to <
line 32805=>leave.' <
line 32806=>     `He was the last,' said  Frodo, 'but Aragorn was forced to lead us.  He <
line 32807=> after  Gandalf's fall. But had there  not been us lesser  <

line 32812=> once  again.  `For I  would  learn more  of Minas  Ithil  and <
line 32813=>Osgiliath, and  Minas Tirith the long-enduring. What  hope have you for that <

line 32815=> '  said Faramir. 'It is long since we had any hope. <

line 32832=> because the NÂ®menoreans still,  as they had in <

line 32838=>stars. And the last king of the line of Anbrion had no heir. <

line 33025=>     `I will,' said Frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm <
line 33026=>blanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the  fireless  cave. The  noise of  the <
line 33027=>water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir. <
line 33028=>     Sam, waking  suddenly  by some instinct of watchfulness,  saw first his <
line 33029=>mpty  bed  and  leapt to his feet. Then  he saw  two dark figures, <
line 33030=>gainst the archway, which was now filled with  a <
line 33031=>ight. He  hurried after  them,  past rows of men  sleeping  on <
line 33032=>mattresses along the  wall. As he went by  the  cave-mouth  he saw  that the <

line 33037=>     They went first  along a black passage, then up  many wet steps, and so <
line 33038=>at  landing cut in the stone  and  lit  by  the pale  sky, <
line 33039=>gleaming  high  above through a  long deep shaft.  From here two flights  of <
line 33040=>n, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream; <
line 33041=>the other turning away to the left. This they  followed. It wound its way up <
line 33042=> At last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were <
line 33043=>on a without rail or parapet. At their right, eastwards, the <
line 33044=>torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then,  pouring down  a steep <
line 33045=>hewn channel with  a  dark  force of water flecked <
line 33046=>with  foam,  and curling and rushing almost at  their  feet it  plunged sheer  <
line 33047=> upon their left.  A man  stood  there, near the  <
line 33048=>brink, silent, gazing down. <
line 33049=>d to  watch the sleek necks of the  water as they curved and <
line 33050=><
line 33051=>####-dived.  Then he lifted his  eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and  <
line 33052=>cold,  as if dawn were near. Far off in  the West the full moon was sinking, <
line 33053=>round and white. Pale mists shimmered in the  great vale below:  a wide gulf <
line 33054=>0beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the Anduin. A <
line 33055=>black  darkness  loomed beyond,  and  in  it glinted, here and  there, cold, <
line 33056=>sharp, remote, white as  the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the <
line 33057=>White Mountains of the Realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow. <
line 33058=>     For a while Frodo  stood  there on  the  high stone, and  a shiver  ran <
line 33059=>ering if anywhere in  the vastness  of the night -lands his <
line 33060=> companions walked  or slept,  or lay dead  shrouded in  mist. Why was he <
line 33061=>forgetful sleep?  <
line 33062=>     Sam was eager for  an answer to the same question and could not refrain <
line 33063=>s master's ear alone as  he thought: 'It's  a  <
line 33064=>lone as  he thought: 'It's  a  ubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention   the <

line 33066=>     Faramir heard and answered. `Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil as he goes <

line 33071=>     He  stepped  up beside the silent sentinel on the dark  edge. and Frodo <
line 33072=>e already felt insecure enough on this high  wet <
line 33073=>platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they  saw  the white <
line 33074=>waters pour into  a foaming  bowl, and then  swirl darkly about  a deep oval <
line 33075=>. until they found  their  way out  again through a narrow <
line 33076=>gate, and  flowed away, fuming  and  chattering, into  calmer and more level <
line 33077=> still slanted down to the  fall's foot and gleamed on <
line 33078=>the ripples of the basin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on <
line 33079=> as he  looked at  it, it  dived and vanished just  <
line 33080=>beyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the  black  water as neatly <

line 33094=>looking at. <
line 33095=>his thing is? '  said Faramir.  `Come, now you  <
line 33096=>ll me why it should be  spared. In all our words together you  <
line 33097=>have not once  spoken  of your gangrel companion, and I  let him be for  the <
line 33098=>ait till he  was  caught and  brought before me. I sent my <
line 33099=>keenest huntsmen to seek  him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of <

line 33101=>done worse trespass than  only  to go  coney-snaring in the uplands: he  has <
line 33102=>Annyn,  and his life is forfeit.  I marvel at  the <
line 33103=>creature: so secret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before <
line 33104=>  that men sleep without watch all  night? Why <
line 33105=> without watch all  night? Why    'There are two answers, I think,' said  Frodo. `For one thing, he knows <

line 33112=>     'He  bore  it? ' said Faramir, breathing sharply in  his wonder.  `This <

line 33115=> But I did not speak of that.'  creature seek? ' <
line 33116=>said Frodo. `Look! ' <
line 33117=>     They peered down at the dark pool. A little black head  appeared at the <
line 33118=>far end of the basin,  just out of the deep shadow of the rocks. There was a  <
line 33119=>glint, and a swirl  of tiny ripples. It swam to  the side,  and <
line 33120=> froglike figure climbed out of the water and <
line 33121=>e climbed out of the water and nce it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing  <
line 33122=>that glittered  as it  turned:  the  last rays of the moon  were now  falling <
line 33123=><
line 33124=>####-behind the stony wall at the pool's end. <
line 33125=> the pool's end.   Faramir  laughed softly.  `Fish! '  he said.  `It  is  a less  perilous <
line 33126=>hunger. Or maybe not: fish from  the pool of Henneth Annyn  may cost him all <
line 33127=>to give.' <
line 33128=>     `Now I have him at the arrow-point,' said Anborn. `Shall  I not  shoot, <
line 33129=>? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.' <
line 33130=>     `Wait, Anborn,'  said Faramir.  `This is a harder matter than it seems. <
line 33131=>What have you to say now, Frodo? Why should we spare? ' <
line 33132=>0    `The creature is wretched and hungry,' said Frodo, `and unaware of  his <

line 33151=>and then up the other stair, until  at  last they  came to a narrow  opening <
line 33152=>ushes. Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on <
line 33153=>the top of  the southern bank above the pool. It  was now dark and the falls <
line 33154=>0lecting only the lingering moonlight of the western <
line 33155=>sky. He could not see Gollum. He went forward  a  short way and Anborn  <

line 33160=>, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to <
line 33161=>steady himself.  The rocks  were  for  the  most part  flat  and smooth  but <

line 33165=>     'Fissh, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last, yes.  <

line 33173=>most as unceasing as the waterfall,  only  interrupted <
line 33174=>by  a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. Frodo  shivered, listening with <

line 33220=>     Gollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way, snuffling and <

line 33245=>he said to Frodo. <
line 33246=>dn't get him. He  came to me, because  he trusted me <

line 33257=>removed <
line 33258=>the cover from  Gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to <
line 33259=>support him. Gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy <
line 33260=>pale lids. A  very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling  <
line 33261=> one in his  hand); his sparse locks were  hanging <
line 33262=>like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling. <
line 33263=>     `Loose us! Loose us! '  he said.  `The  cord hurts us, yes it does,  it <

line 33291=> before? ' owly Gollum  raised his eyes and  looked  unwillingly into Faramir's.  <
line 33292=>All light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into <
line 33293=>unwavering  eyes of the man of Gondor. There  was a still silence. <

line 33295=>floor,  shivering.  'We  doesn't  know  and we  doesn't want  to  know,'  he  <

line 33297=>     `There are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms <

line 33299=>It is well  for you. What oath will  you swear never to return; and never to <
line 33300=>lead any living creature hither by word or sign?' <
line 33301=>     `Master knows,'  said Gollum with a  sidelong glance at Frodo. `Yes, he <

line 33310=>     Faramir sat for a moment in thought. `Very good,' he  said at last.  `I  <

line 33317=>  `Then I  will declare my doom,' said Faramir. `As for you, Frodo, in so <

line 33331=>     `I  do  take  Smjagol under  my  protection,' said  Frodo.  Sam  sighed <
line 33332=> at  the courtesies, of which, as  any  hobbit  would, he <
line 33333=>thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a  <

line 33345=>     `There is no open gate into the Nameless Land,' said Faramir. <
line 33346=>     `Seeing this, we  turned aside and came by  the Southward road '  Frodo <
line 33347=>continued; 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to Minas <

line 33353=>ame of that high pass? ' said Faramir. <
line 33354=>hat high pass? ' said Faramir.      'It is  called Cirith Ungol.' Gollum hissed sharply and began muttering <
line 33355=>to himself. `Is not that its name? ' said Faramir turning to him. <
line 33356=>id  Gollum, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed <
line 33357=>him. 'Yes, yes, we heard the name once. But what does the name matter to us? <

line 33360=> said  Faramir. `How do  you  know  that? And who has <
line 33361=>explored  all  the  confines  of  that  dark  realm? '  He  looked long  and <
line 33362=>sently he spoke  again. `Take this creature away, <
line 33363=>Anborn. Treat  him gently, but watch  him.  And do not you,  Smjagol, try to <

line 33366=>     Anbor Gollum went cringing before him.  The curtain was <
line 33367=>drawn across the recess.  <
line 33368=>     `Frodo, I think you do very unwisely in this,' said Faramir.  `I do not <

line 33370=>     'No, not altogether wicked,' said Frodo. <
line 33371=> 'No, not altogether wicked,' said Frodo. said Faramir; 'but malice eats it like a canker, <

line 33484=>and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annyn. After they  had passed the <

line 33539=>silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under  <
line 33540=>the trees. It felt as if thunder was  brewing. Gollum often paused, sniffing <

line 33542=>     As the third stage of  their day's  march drew on  and afternoon wa ned, <

line 33546=>brown-green  buds.  About them  lay long launds of green  grass dappled with <
line 33547=>celandine and anemones, white and blue, now folded for sleep; and there were <
line 33548=>h  the leaves of  woodland hyacinths: already their sleek  <
line 33549=>bell-stems were  thrusting through the  mould . No  living creature, beast or  <
line 33550=>, but in these open places Gollum grew afraid, and  they  <
line 33551=>walked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another. <
line 33552=><
line 33553=>####-     Light  was fading fast when they came to the forest -end. There they sat <
line 33554=>under  an old gnarled oak that  sent its roots twisting like snakes  down  a  <
line 33555=>dim valley lay before them. On its further side <
line 33556=>ered  again,  blue  and grey under  the  sullen  evening, and <
line 33557=>marched on southwards. To the  right the Mountains of Gondor  glowed, <
line 33558=>der  a fire-flecked  sky. To  the left  lay darkness:  the <
line 33559=>towering walls of Mordor;  and  out of  that darkness the long valley  came, <
line 33560=>ever -widening trough towards the Anduin. At its bottom <
line 33561=>ran a hurrying stream:  Frodo could  hear its stony voice coming  up through <
line 33562=>0it on the hither side a road went winding down like <
line 33563=>a pale ribbon, down into chill grey mists that  no  gleam of sunset touched. <
line 33564=>t he descried far off, floating as it were on a  <
line 33565=>shadowy sea, the high  dim  tops and broken pinnacles of old  towers forlorn <

line 33568=> know where we are? ' he said. Dangerous places. This is the road from the Tower of the <
line 33569=>Moon, Master, down to the ruined city by the shores of the River. The ruined <
line 33570=>ace, full of  enemies. We shouldn't have taken Men's <
line 33571=>advice. Hobbits have come a long way out of the path. Must go east now, away <
line 33572=>ny arm  towards  the darkling mountains. `And we <
line 33573=>can't  use  this  road. Oh  no!  Cruel peoples come this way, down  from the <

line 33575=>on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving  on it  <
line 33576=>now. It appeared lonely  and forsaken, running  down to empty  ruins  in the <
line 33577=>l feeling in the air, as if things might indeed be <
line 33578=>passing up and down that  eyes could  not see. Frodo shuddered  as he looked <

line 33587=> the middle of the night. There'll still be hours of dark then time enough <
line 33588=> long march, if you know the way.' <
line 33589=>g march, if you know the way.' ly agreed  to  this, and  he  turned  back towards the <
line 33590=>trees, working eastward for a  while along the straggling edges of the wood.  <
line 33591=>He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate <
line 33592=>they  all climbed  up into  the  crotch of  a  large  holm-oak, whose  thick  <
line 33593=>from  the trunk made a good  hiding-place and  a <
line 33594=>fairly comfortable refuge.  Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the <
line 33595=>canopy of the  tree.  Frodo and Sam drank a  little water and ate some bread <
line 33596=>ut Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits <
line 33597=>did not shut their eyes. <
line 33598=>     It must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up: suddenly <
line 33599=>eyes unlidded gleaming at them. He  listened and <
line 33600=>sniffed,  which seemed,  as  they had noticed before,  his  usual method  of <
line 33601=>discovering the time of night. <
line 33602=>     'Are we rested? Have we had beautiful sleep?' he said. 'Let's go!' <
line 33603=> haven't,' growled Sam. 'But we'll go if we must.' <
line 33604=>     Gollum dropped at once  from  the branches of the tree on to all fours,  <
line 33605=> slowly. <
line 33606=>  were down they  went  on again  with Gollum leading,  <
line 33607=>eastwards, up the  dark sloping  land. They could see little,  for the night <
line 33608=>0ey were  hardly aware of the  stems of trees before <
line 33609=>they stumbled  against them. The ground  became more broken  and walking <
line 33610=>was <
line 33611=>seemed in no  way troubled. He  led them through <
line 33612=>thickets and wastes of brambles; sometimes round  the lip of a deep cleft or  <
line 33613=>lack bush-shrouded hollows and out again; but <
line 33614=>ded hollows and out again; but  a little downward, always the further slope was longer and <
line 33615=>steeper. They were climbing steadily. At their first  halt they looked back, <
line 33616=>and they could  dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they   had left behind <
line 33617=>lying like  a  vast  dense shadow, a darker night under the  dark blank sky. <
line 33618=>at  blackness looming slowly out of the East, eating  <

line 33622=>must hurry. Not safe to stay in the open in these places. Make haste! ' <
line 33623=>     He quickened his pace, and they  followed him wearily.  Soon they began <
line 33624=>eat hog-back of land. For the most part it was covered <
line 33625=>with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and  low tough thorns, though <
line 33626=>ings opened, the scars of recent fires. The gorse-bushes <
line 33627=>became  more frequent  as they  got nearer the  top; very old and  tall they <
line 33628=>low but thick above, and already  putting out yellow <
line 33629=>flowers  that  glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint  sweet scent. So tall <
line 33630=>t the  hobbits could  walk upright  under  them, <
line 33631=>passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould. <
line 33632=>     On the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march and  <
line 33633=>eath a  tangled  knot  of  thorns.  Their  twisted <
line 33634=>boughs, stooping to the ground, were overridden  by a clambering maze of old <
line 33635=>  a hollow hall, raftered with dead branch and <
line 33636=> raftered with dead branch and fed with the first leaves and  shoots  of spring. There they <
line 33637=>lay for a  while, too tired yet to eat; and peering out through the holes in <
line 33638=>the covert they watched for the slow growth of day. <
line 33639=>dead brown twilight. In the East  there was a  <
line 33640=>ght. In the East  there was a  nder the lowering cloud: it  was not the red of dawn. Across <
line 33641=>the tumbled lands between, the mountains of the Ephel DÂ®ath frowned at <
line 33642=>0s below where night lay thick and did not pass away, above <
line 33643=>with  jagged  tops  and edges outlined  hard and  menacing against the fiery <

line 33645=>and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward. <

line 33647=>the Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass? ' <
line 33648=>     `Need we think about it yet?' said Sam, `Surely we're not going to move <
line 33649=>' <
line 33650=>t,' said Gollum.  `But we must go soon, to  the <
line 33651=>Cross-roads.  Yes,  to  the  Cross-roads. That's the  way  over  ther e  yes, <
line 33652=>Master.' <
line 33653=>r Mordor  died  away. The twilight deepened  as  great <
line 33654=>vapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and Sam took a little <
line 33655=>but Gollum was restless.  He would  not eat any of <
line 33656=>their food, but  he  drank  a little water and  then crawled about under the <
line 33657=>. Then. suddenly he disappeared. <
line 33658=>Then. suddenly he disappeared.  said Sam and yawned. It was his turn to sleep <
line 33659=>was soon deep in a dream. He thought he was back in the  Bag <
line 33660=>End garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which <
line 33661=>made all seemed very weedy and rank  somehow, and thorns and <
line 33662=>bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge. <
line 33663=>     `A job of work for me, I can see; but I'm so tired,' he kept on saying. <
line 33664=>ed what he was looking  for. `My  pipe!'  he said, and <
line 33665=>with that he woke up. <
line 33666=>0said  to himself, as he opened his eyes and wondered why he <
line 33667=>was lying  down under the hedge. `It's in  your pack all the time!'  Then he <
line 33668=>realized, first that the pipe might  be in his pack but he had  no leaf, and <
line 33669=>next that he was hundreds of miles from  Bag End. He sat up. It seemed to be <
line 33670=>almost dark. Why had his master let him sleep  on out of turn, right on till <
line 33671=>     `Haven't you had no sleep, Mr. Frodo?' he said. 'What's the time? Seems <
line 33672=>!' <
line 33673=>do.  `But  the day is getting darker instead  of <
line 33674=>lighter: darker and  darker. As far as I  can tell, it isn't midday yet, and <
line 33675=>you've only slept for about three hours.' <
line 33676=> slept for about three hours.'  up,' said  Sam. 'Is there  a storm coming? If  so it's <
line 33677=>going  to  be the  worst there ever was. We shall  wish  we were down a deep <
line 33678=>0er a hedge.' He listened. `What's that? Thunder, or  <
line 33679=>drums, or what is it? ' <
line 33680=>0w,' said  Frodo. `It's been going on for a good while  now.  <
line 33681=>Sometimes the ground seems  to  tremble, sometimes it seems to be  the heavy <
line 33682=>air throbbing in your ears.' <
line 33683=>     Sam looked  round.  `Where's Gollum?  ' he said. 'Hasn't he  come  back  <
line 33684=>yet?' <
line 33685=>     `No,' said Frodo. `There's not been a sign or sound of him.' <
line 33686=>     `Well,  him,'  said  Sam.  `In fact,  I've  never taken <
line 33687=>ourney that I'd have been less sorry to lose  on the way. But <
line 33688=>it  would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to go and get lost  <
line 33689=>shall need him most  --  that is, if he's ever going  to be <
line 33690=>any use, which I doubt.' <
line 33691=>     `You forget the Marshes,' said Frodo.  `I hope nothing has happened  to <
line 33692=>s  up to  no  tricks. And anyway I  hope he doesn't fall <
line 33693=>into other hands, as you might say. Because if he does, we  shall soon be in <
line 33694=>hat moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again, louder now <
line 33695=>ed to quiver under their feet. 'I think we are in <
line 33696=><
line 33697=>####-for trouble anyhow,' said Frodo. `I'm  afraid our journey  is  drawing to an <
line 33698=>0 Sam;  `but  where there's life there's hope, as my Gaffer  <
line 33699=>used to say;  and need of vittles, as he  mostways used to  add. You  have a  <
line 33700=> then a bit of sleep.' <
line 33701=>     The  afternoon, as Sam supposed it must be called, wore on. Looking out <
line 33702=>from the  covert he  could see only a dun, shadowless  world,  fading slowly <
line 33703=>into a featureless,  colourless gloom.  It felt stifling but not warm. Frodo <
line 33704=>  tossing,  and sometimes murmuring. Twice Sam <
line 33705=>sometimes murmuring. Twice Sam d him speaking  Gandalf's  name.  The  time  seemed  to drag <
line 33706=>interminably. Suddenly Sam heard a hiss behind him, and  there was Gollum <
line 33707=>at them with gleaming eyes.  <
line 33708=>     `Wake up, wake up! Wake up, sleepies!' he whispered. `Wake up!  No time <
line 33709=>to lose. We must go, yes, we must go at once. No time to lose!' <
line 33710=> him suspiciously: he  seemed frightened or excited.  `Go <
line 33711=>now? What's your little game?  It isn't time yet. It can't be tea -time even, <
line 33712=>leastways not in decent places where there is tea -time.' <
line 33713=>     `Silly!  ' hissed Gollum. `We're not in  decent places.  Time's running <
line 33714=>short, yes, running fast. No time to lose. We must go. Wake up. Master, wake <
line 33715=>o, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and <
line 33716=> of sleep, sat up suddenly and  arm. Gollum tore h imself loose and backed away. <
line 33717=>     'They mustn't  be silly,' he hissed. `We must go. No time to lose!' And <
line 33718=>out of him. Where he  had been, and  what  he <
line 33719=>re he  had been, and  what  he ng to make  him in  such a hurry, he would not say. Sam was <
line 33720=>filled with deep suspicion,  and showed it; but  Frodo gave no sign  of what <
line 33721=>was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out <
line 33722=>into the ever -gathering darkness.  <
line 33723=>ess.     Very stealthily  Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover  <
line 33724=>wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any <
line 33725=>open space; but the light was now so dim that even  a keen-eyed beast of the <
line 33726=>wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor  <
line 33727=>em,  walking as warily as the little people can. Without the crack of <
line 33728=>0 leaf they passed and vanished. <
line 33729=> leaf they passed and vanished. t on, silently, in  single file, oppressed by <
line 33730=>@the  absolute stillness  of the land,  broken only now  and <
line 33731=>in  by the  faint rumbling as  of thunder far away or  drum-beats in some  <
line 33732=>e hills.  Down  from their hiding-place  they  went,  and then <
line 33733=>turning  south they steered as straight a course as Gollum could find across <
line 33734=>e that leaned up towards the mountains. Presently, not far  <
line 33735=>ahead, looming up  like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. As they drew <
line 33736=>ware  that  these were of vast  size,  very  ancient it <
line 33737=>seemed, and still towering high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as <
line 33738=>0blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill <
line 33739=>them or to shake their fathomless roots.  <
line 33740=>s roots.       'The Cross-roads, yes,' whispered Gollum, the first words that had been <
line 33741=> left  their hiding-place. 'We must go  that way.' Turning <
line 33742=>eastward  now, he led them up  the slope;  and  then suddenly  there  it was <
line 33743=>ward Road, winding its way about the outer feet of the <
line 33744=>mountains, until presently it plunged  into the great ring of trees.  <
line 33745=>     'This is the only way,' whispered Gollum. 'No paths beyond the road. No <
line 33746=>o the Cross-roads. But make haste! Be silent! ' <
line 33747=>     As furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they crept <
line 33748=>down on to the road, and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank, <
line 33749=>themselves,  and soft -footed  as hunting cats.  At length <
line 33750=>they reached the trees, and found that they stood in a great  roofless ring, <
line 33751=> the sombre sky; and the spaces between  their immense <
line 33752=>boles  were  like the great  dark arches of  some  ruined  hall. In the very <
line 33753=>nd them lay the road to the  Morannon; before them <
line 33754=>it ran out again upon its  long journey south; to their right the road  from <
line 33755=> up,  and crossing,  passed out eastward  into <
line 33756=>ng,  passed out eastward  into urth way, the road they were to take. <
line 33757=>     Stan moment filled with dread Frodo became aware that a  <
line 33758=>light was shining;  he  saw it  glowing  on  Sam's face beside  him. Turning <
line 33759=>towards it, n arch of boughs, the road to  Osgiliath running  <
line 33760=>aight  as  a stretched ribbon down, down, into the West. There, <
line 33761=> overwhelmed in shade,  the  Sun was <
line 33762=>helmed in shade,  the  Sun was the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling <
line 33763=>in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied Sea. The brief glow fell upon a  <

line 33765=>The years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, <
line 33766=>t in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted <
line 33767=>by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in <
line 33768=>rehead. Upon its knees and mighty chair,  and all about <
line 33769=>the pedestal,  were idle  scrawls  mixed  with  the foul  symbols  that  the <
line 33770=>0d. <
line 33771=> level beams,  Frodo saw the old king's head: it <
line 33772=>was lying rolled away by the  roadside. `Look, Sam!' he cried, startled into <

line 33774=>were hollow and the  carven  beard was  broken, but about the <
line 33775=>high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant <
line 33776=>mall white stars had bound  itself across the brows as if <
line 33777=>in reverence for the fallen king,  and in the crevices  of  his  stony  hair <
line 33778=>d. <
line 33779=>r ever!' said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief <
line 33780=>glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and  as if at the  shuttering <
line 33781=>of a lamp, black night fell. <
line 33782=> <
line 33783=><
line 33784=>f Cirith Ungol <
line 33785=>  was  tugging  at  Frodo's  cloak  and  hissing  with  fear  and <
line 33786=>said. `We mustn't stand here. Make haste!' <
line 33787=>stn't stand here. Make haste!' do turned his back on the West and followed as his guide <
line 33788=>led  him, out into the darkness of the East. They left the ring of trees and <
line 33789=>ards the mountains. This road, too, ran straight for  <
line 33790=>a while,  but  soon it began to  bend  away southwards,  until it came right <
line 33791=> rock that they had seen from the distance. Black  <
line 33792=>and  forbidding  it  loomed  above them, darker  than the  dark  sky behind. <
line 33793=>he road  went on,  and rounding it sprang  east  <
line 33794=>again and began to climb steeply. <
line 33795=>imb steeply. and Sam were  plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to  <
line 33796=>peril. Frodo's head  was  bowed; his burden  was <
line 33797=>dragging him down again. As soon as the great  Cross-roads  had been passed, <
line 33798=>the weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien, had begun to grow once more. <
line 33799=>ay become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and <
line 33800=>then he  saw  it, even  as Gollum  had said  that he would: the city of  the <
line 33801=>d against the stony bank. <
line 33802=>     A long-tilted  valley, a  deep gulf of shadow,  ran back far  into  the <
line 33803=>mountains. Upon the further side, some way  within the valley's arms high on <
line 33804=>a  rocky seat upon the black knees  of  the Ephel DÂ®ath, stood the walls and  <
line 33805=>0l was dark about it, earth and sky, but it  was lit <
line 33806=>with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of <
line 33807=>of the  Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of <
line 33808=>the hills. Paler  indeed than  the moon ailing in some  slow eclipse was the <
line 33809=>light of it now, wavering and blowing like a  noisome exhalation of decay, a  <
line 33810=>ght that  illuminated  nothing.  In  the  walls  and tower  <
line 33811=>windows showed, like countless black holes  looking inward  into  emptiness;  <
line 33812=>rse of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then <
line 33813=>another, a huge ghostly head  leering into the night. For a moment the three <
line 33814=> shrinking,  staring  up with unwilling eyes. Gollum <
line 33815=>was the first to recover. Again he pulled  at their cloaks urgently,  but he <
line 33816=>gged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and <
line 33817=>time seemed to slow its pace. so that between the raising of a foot  and the <
line 33818=><
line 33819=> of loathing passed. <
line 33820=>     So they came  slowly  to the  white  bridge.  Here  the  road, gleaming <
line 33821=>tream  in the midst of the valley, and went  on, <
line 33822=>winding  deviously up towards the city's gate: a black  mouth opening in the <
line 33823=>outer circle of the  northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy <
line 33824=>meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and <
line 33825=>yet horrible of shape, like the demented  forms in an uneasy dream; and they  <
line 33826=>gave forth a  faint sickening charnel-smell; an  odour  of rottenness filled <
line 33827=>r. From  mead to mead  the  bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its <
line 33828=>0g  in forms human  and bestial, but all corrupt and  <
line 33829=>  The water flowing  beneath was  silent, and  it steamed, but the <
line 33830=>urling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly <
line 33831=>cold. Frodo felt his senses  reeling and his mind darkening. Then  suddenly, <
line 33832=>as if some force were  at work other than his own will, he began  to  hurry, <
line 33833=> his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to <
line 33834=>. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his  master in his arms,  <
line 33835=>most fell, right on the threshold of the bridge. <
line 33836=>     `Not  that way! No, not that  way! '  whispered  Gollum, but the breath <
line 33837=>between  his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he <
line 33838=>und in terror. <
line 33839=> Mr. Frodo! ' muttered Sam  in  Frodo's ear. 'Come back! Not <
line 33840=>that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.' <
line 33841=>     Frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the <
line 33842=> luminous  tower fascinated him,  and he fought  the <
line 33843=>desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last  <
line 33844=>ck, and as  he did so, he felt the Ring resisting <
line 33845=>him, dragging  at the chain about his  neck; and his  eyes too, as he looked <
line 33846=> have  been blinded.  The darkness before him <
line 33847=>nded.  The darkness before him  <
line 33848=>ed.  The darkness before him  ground like  a frightened animal, was  already <
line 33849=>he gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his  stumbling master, <
line 33850=>followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the  <
line 33851=>strgap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this  they <
line 33852=>d, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow  path that gleamed faintly at <
line 33853=>d  did,  until  climb ing  above  the meads of  deadly <
line 33854=>flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern <
line 33855=>#-     Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum <
line 33856=>m, except when  he turned back to  beckon them  on. Then his <
line 33857=>eyes  shone  with  a green-white light, reflecting  the noisome Morgul-sheen <
line 33858=>by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam  and <
line 33859=>of  the dark eyeholes Frodo  and Sam  were  always conscious,  ever glancing <
line 33860=>ulders,  and  ever dragging their eyes  back to find <
line 33861=>the darkening path. Slowly  they laboured on. As they rose  above the stench  <
line 33862=>us stream their  breath  became easier and  their <
line 33863=>heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as  if they had walked <
line 33864=>d been swimming long against a heavy  tide of <
line 33865=> long against a heavy  tide of ey could go no further without a halt. <
line 33866=>     Frosat down on a stone. They had now climbed up  to the <
line 33867=>top  of  a  great  hump of bare rock.  Ahead of them  there was a bay in the <
line 33868=>valley-side, head of this  the path  went on, no more than a  <
line 33869=>th a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the <
line 33870=>til it disappeared into the blackness above. <
line 33871=>ared into the blackness above.  a  while, Sam,' whispered Frodo. `It's heavy  on me,  Sam <
line 33872=>lad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry  it? Anyway I must rest before <
line 33873=>we venture on to that.' He pointed to the narrow way ahead. <
line 33874=>     `Sssh! ssh! ' hissed Gollum hurrying back to them. `Sssh! ' His fingers <
line 33875=>were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging  at Frodo's sleeve,  <
line 33876=> but Frodo would not move. <
line 33877=>     `Not  yet,' he  said,  'not  yet.' Weariness and  more  than  weariness <
line 33878=>oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind  and body. <
line 33879=>`I must rest,' he muttered. <
line 33880=>     At  this  Gollum's fear  and  agitation became so  great that he  spoke <
line 33881=>hand, as  if to  keep  the  sound  from  unseen <
line 33882=>listeners  in the air. `Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! Eyes can see us. <
line 33883=>When they come  to the  bridge they will see  us. Come away!  Climb,  climb!  <
line 33884=>me, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. `He's right, again. We can't stay here.' <
line 33885=>     'All  rdo  in a  remote voice, as of one  speaking half <
line 33886=>asleep. `I will try.' Wearily he got to his feet. <
line 33887=>.  At that moment the rock quivered  and trembled <
line 33888=>beneath them. The  great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled  in <
line 33889=>untains.  Then  with searing suddenness there <
line 33890=> with searing suddenness there flash. Far beyond the eastern  mountains it leapt into  the <
line 33891=><
line 33892=>####-sky and splashed the lowering clouds with cr imson.  In that valley of shadow <
line 33893=>and  cold deathly light it  seemed  unbearably violent  and fierce. Peaks of <
line 33894=>stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the <
line 33895=> Gorgoroth. Then came a great crack of thunder. <
line 33896=>Morgul answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks <
line 33897=>of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into <
line 33898=>The earth groaned; and out of the city there came  a cry. <
line 33899=>Mingled  with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the shrill neighing <
line 33900=>e  and fear, there came a rending screech, shivering, <
line 33901=>rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing.  The hobbits <
line 33902=>nd cast themselves down, holding their hands upon <
line 33903=>their ears. <
line 33904=>     As the terrible cry ended, falling back  through a long sickening  wail <
line 33905=> slowly  raised his head.  Across the  narrow  valley, now <
line 33906=>almost on  a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood ,  and its <
line 33907=>ed like an open mouth with gleaming  teeth,  was gaping <
line 33908=>wide. And out of the gate an army came. <
line 33909=>de. And out of the gate an army came. in  sable, dark  as the night. Against the wan <
line 33910=>uminous pavement  of  the  road Frodo could  see them, small <
line 33911=>black figures in rank upon rank,  marching  swiftly  and  silently,  passing <
line 33912=>ess stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen <
line 33913=>moving like  ordered shadows, and at their head was one greater than all the <
line 33914=>, save that on his  hooded head he had a helm like a  <
line 33915=>crown that  flickered with  a  perilous  light.  Now he was drawing near the <
line 33916=>staring eyes followed him,  unable to  wink or to <
line 33917=>withdraw. Surely there was the Lord of the  Nine Riders returned to earth to <
line 33918=>e? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king <
line 33919=>re indeed was the haggard king had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife. The <
line 33920=>old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo's heart. <
line 33921=>     Even  as these thoughts  pierced him with dread  and held him  bound as <
line 33922=>with a  spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right  before the  entrance of the <
line 33923=>0l the host stood still. There was  a pause, a  dead <
line 33924=>silence. Maybe it was  the Ring that called  to the  Wraith-lord, and for  a  <
line 33925=>ing some other power within his valley. This way <
line 33926=>and that turned the dark head helmed  and  crowned  with  fear, sweeping the <
line 33927=>shadows with its unseen eyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a  <
line 33928=>0 move.  And  as  he  waited, he felt, more urgent than ever  <
line 33929=><
line 33930=>####-before,  the command  that  he  should  put on  the Ring.  But great as  the <
line 33931=>pressure was, he felt no  inclination now to yield to it. He  knew that  the <
line 33932=>Ring would only betray him, and that he had not, even if  he  put it on, the <
line 33933=>  Morgul-king-not yet. There was no  longer any  answer to <
line 33934=>that command in his own will,  dismayed by terror though it was, and he  felt <
line 33935=>n him of a  great power from outside. It took his hand, <
line 33936=>and as Frodo watched with his mind, not willing it but in suspense (as if he <
line 33937=>0 far  away), it moved the hand inch by inch towards <
line 33938=>the chain upon his neck. Then his  own will stirred;  slowly  it forced  the <
line 33939=>nd another thing, a thing lying hidden near his <
line 33940=>breast. Cold and  hard it  seemed as  his  grip closed on it:  the  phial of <
line 33941=>Galadriel, so long  treasured, and  almost forgotten till  that hour.  As he <
line 33942=>hile all thought of the Ring was banished from his  mind. <
line 33943=>He sighed and bent his head. <
line 33944=>     At  that moment the Wraith-king  turned and spurred  his horse and rode <
line 33945=>0l his dark host followed him. Maybe the elven-hoods <
line 33946=>defied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small enemy; being strengthened, <
line 33947=>.  But  he  was  in haste. Already the hour had <
line 33948=> his great Master's  bidding he must march with  war into the <
line 33949=>West. <
line 33950=>ike a shadow  into shadow, down  the winding road, <
line 33951=>and  behind  him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So great an  army <
line 33952=>e since the  days of  Isildur's might; no host  <
line 33953=>so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet  it <
line 33954=>was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth. <
line 33955=>nd suddenly  his heart went out to Faramir. 'The storm <
line 33956=>has burst at last,' he thought. `This great  array of spears  and  swords is <
line 33957=>aramir get across in time? He  guessed it, but did <
line 33958=>he know the hour? And  who can now hold  the fords when the King of the <
line 33959=>Nine <
line 33960=>es will  come.  I  am too late. All is lost.  I <
line 33961=>way. All is lost. Even if my errand is performed, no one will <
line 33962=>ever know. There will be  no one  I can  tell. It will be in vain.' Overcome <
line 33963=>pt. And still the host of Morgul crossed the bridge. <
line 33964=>     Then at a  great distance, as if it  came out of memories of  the Shire, <
line 33965=> when  the  day called and doors were opening, he <
line 33966=>heard  Sam's voice  speaking. `Wake up, Mr. Frodo!  Wake up! ' Had the voice <
line 33967=>s  ready,' he  would hardly  have  been  surprised. <
line 33968=>Certainly Sam was urgent. `Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone,' he said. <
line 33969=>     There was  a dull clang. The gates of Minas Morgul had closed. The last <
line 33970=>anished down  the road. The tower still grinned  across <
line 33971=>the valley, but the light was fading  in it. The whole city was falling back  <
line 33972=>shade,  and  silence.  Yet still it was filled  with <
line 33973=>watchfulness.  <
line 33974=>!  They're gone, and  we'd better  go too. There's <
line 33975=>something still alive in that place, something with eyes,  or a seeing mind, <
line 33976=>er we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get <
line 33977=>e spot, the sooner it will get n, Mr. Frodo! ' <
line 33978=>r it will get n, Mr. Frodo! ' ed his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but <
line 33979=>the weakness had  passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a <
line 33980=>moment before he had  felt the opposite,  that  what he had to do, he had to <
line 33981=>do, if he could, and that whether  Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel  <
line 33982=> lse ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took <
line 33983=>his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear <
line 33984=>0 through his fingers, he  thrust it into his  bosom <
line 33985=>and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul,  now no <
line 33986=>oss a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward <
line 33987=>road. <
line 33988=>     Gollum, it  seemed,  had  crawled off along the ledge into the darkness <
line 33989=>f Minas  Morgul  opened, leaving the hobbits where <
line 33990=>they  lay. He now came creeping back, his  teeth chattering and his  fingers <
line 33991=>  he hissed. `Make haste!  They  mustn't think  <
line 33992=>danger has passed. It hasn't. Make haste!  ' <
line 33993=>ake haste!  '     They did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It <
line 33994=>iking of either of  them, not even  after facing so  many <
line 33995=>other perils; but it did not  last  long.  Soon the  path reached a  rounded <
line 33996=>tain-side  swelled out  again, and  there it suddenly <
line 33997=>entered a narrow  opening in the rock. They had come to the first stair that <
line 33998=>darkness  was almost complete, and they could see <
line 33999=>nothing  much  beyond their hands' stretch; but  Gollum's  eyes shone  pale, <
line 34000=>d back towards them. <
line 34001=>     `Careful! ' he whispered. `Steps. Lots of steps. Must be careful! ' <
line 34002=>     Care was certainly needed. Frodo and  Sam at  first felt easier, having <
line 34003=>now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder , <
line 34004=><
line 34005=>####-and as they climbed up and  up, they became more  and more aware of the long <
line 34006=>ind them.  And the steps  were narrow,  spaced unevenly,  and <
line 34007=>often treacherous: they  were worn and  smooth at  the  edges, and some were <
line 34008=>broken, and  some cracked  as foot was set  upon them. The hobbits struggled <
line 34009=>on,  until at last they  were  clinging with  desperate fingers to the steps <
line 34010=>r  aching knees  to bend and  straighten; and ever as <
line 34011=>0 cut its way deeper  into the  sheer mountain the rocky walls  rose <
line 34012=>ir heads.  <
line 34013=>t as they felt that they could endure no more, they  saw <
line 34014=>Gollum's  eyes peering  down at them again. `We're up,' he whispered. 'First  <
line 34015=>bbits to  climb so high, very  clever hobbits. Just a  <
line 34016=>few more little steps and that's all, yes.' <
line 34017=>ore little steps and that's all, yes.' Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last  <
line 34018=>t down rubbing their legs  and knees. They were in  a  deep dark <
line 34019=>passage that seemed still to go  up before  them,  though at a gentler slope <
line 34020=>s. Gollum did not let them rest long. <
line 34021=>lum did not let them rest long. ir still,' he said. `Much  longer stair. Rest  when <

line 34023=>e get to the top of next stair. Not yet.' you say? ' he asked. <
line 34024=>     'Yes, yess, longer,' said Gollum. `But not  so  difficult. Hobbits have <
line 34025=>Next comes the Winding Stair.' <
line 34026=>     'And what after that? ' said Sam. <
line 34027=>d what after that? ' said Sam. d Gollum softly. `O yes, we shall see!  ' <
line 34028=>aid there  was  a  tunnel,' said  Sam.  `Isn't  there a  <
line 34029=>tunnel or something to go through? ' <
line 34030=>h? '      'O yes,  there's a tunnel,' said Gollum. `But hobbits  can rest  before <
line 34031=>they get through that,  they'll be nearly at the top. Very <
line 34032=>nearly, if they get through. O yes! ' <
line 34033=>rly, if they get through. O yes! ' b had made him sweat, but now  he felt cold and <
line 34034=>re was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from <
line 34035=>the invisible  heights above. He got up and shook himself.  `Well, let's  go <
line 34036=>on! ' he said. `This is no place to sit in.' <
line 34037=>place to sit in.' The passage seemed to go on  for miles, and always the chill air flowed <
line 34038=>over them, rising as they went on to  a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to <
line 34039=>0 with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the  <
line 34040=>,  or to blow them away  into the darkness behind. <
line 34041=>They only knew  that  they had come  to the end, when suddenly  they felt no <
line 34042=>. They  could see very little. Great black shapeless <
line 34043=>masses and deep  grey shadows loomed above  them and about them, but now <
line 34044=>and <
line 34045=>ckered up under  the lowering  clouds, and for  a  <
line 34046=>moment  they were aware of  tall peaks, in  front  and on  either side, like <
line 34047=>ing roof. They  seemed to have climbed up many <
line 34048=>seemed to have climbed up many , on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their  left and a chasm <
line 34049=>on their right. <
line 34050=>     Gollum led the way close under the cliff.  For the present they were no <
line 34051=>ger climbing, but the  ground  was now more broken  and  dangerous in the <
line 34052=> blocks and  lumps of fallen stone  in the  way.  Their <
line 34053=>going  was slow and  cautious.  How  many hours  had  passed  since they had <
line 34054=>0 neither Sam nor Frodo could  any longer guess. The <
line 34055=>night seemed endless. <
line 34056=>were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more <
line 34057=>a stairway opened before them. Again  they halted, and  again they  began to  <
line 34058=>climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this  stairway did not delve into <
line 34059=>the  mountain-side. Here  the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path <
line 34060=>like  a  snake wound  to and fro across it. At one point it crawled sideways <
line 34061=> edge of the dark chasm, and Frodo  glancing down saw below him <

line 34065=>     Still  on and up the  stairway bent and  crawled, until  at last with a  <
line 34066=>final flight, short  and straight, it climbed out again on to another level. <
line 34067=> veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now <
line 34068=>rse at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the <
line 34069=>om of a lesser cleft among the of  the Ephel DÂ®ath. Dimly  the hobbits could  discern tall <
line 34070=>piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side, between which were great <
line 34071=>es blacker than  the night, where  forgotten winter s had <
line 34072=>gnawed and carved the sunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed <
line 34073=>ould not tell whether a  dreadful morning were indeed <
line 34074=>coming to this place of shadow, or whether  they saw only the flame of  some <
line 34075=>in  the torment  of Gorgoroth  beyond.  Still far <
line 34076=>ahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very <
line 34077=>ainst the sullen redness of the eastern sky a  <
line 34078=> redness of the eastern sky a  ed  in  the topmost ridge,  narrow, deep-cloven between  two <

line 34081=>     He paused  and looked more attentively. The horn upon the left was tall <
line 34082=> in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land <
line 34083=>beyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it  was a black  tower poised <
line 34084=>. He touched Sam's arm and pointed. <
line 34085=>touched Sam's arm and pointed. k of that! ' said Sam.  `So  this secret  way  of <
line 34086=>yours is guarded after all,' he growled, turning to Gollum. 'As you knew all <

line 34088=>hobbits must This may  be least watched. Perhaps they've all  <
line 34089=>gone away to big battle, perhaps! ' <
line 34090=> perhaps! ' rhaps,' grunted Sam.  'Well, it  still  seems a long  way off, and a  <
line 34091=>0t there. And there's still the tunnel. I think  you  <
line 34092=>ought to rest now,  Mr. Frodo. I don't know what time of day or night it is, <
line 34093=>rs and hours.' <
line 34094=>st  rest,' said Frodo. 'Let us find some corner out  of  the <
line 34095=>wind, and gather our  strength-for  the last lap.' For so  he felt it to be. <
line 34096=> land  beyond, and  the deed to  be  done there,  seemed <
line 34097=>remote, too  far off yet to  trouble  him. All his mind  was bent on getting <
line 34098=>enetrable wall and guard.  If once he could do  that <
line 34099=>impossible thing, then  somehow the errand would be  accomplished, or so  it <
line 34100=>hour of weariness, still  labouring in the stony <
line 34101=>shadows under Cirith Ungol. <
line 34102=>0evice between two great piers of rock they sat down:  Frodo <
line 34103=>and  Sam a  little  way within. and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the <
line 34104=>opening. There the hobbits took what  they expected would be their last meal <
line 34105=>before they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they <
line 34106=>would <
line 34107=>ever  eat together. Some of the food  of Gondor they ate, and  wafers of the <
line 34108=>waybread of the Elves. and they drank a little. But of their water they were <
line 34109=> to moisten their dry mouths. <
line 34110=>     `I wonder when we'll find water again? ' said Sam. 'But I suppose  even <
line 34111=>nk? Orcs drink, don't they? ' <
line 34112=>     'Yes,  they drink,' said Frodo. 'But do not let  us speak of that. Such <
line 34113=>drink is not for us.' <
line 34114=>eed  to fill our bottles,' said  Sam. `But there <
line 34115=>isn't any water up here: not  a sound or a trickle  have I heard. And anyway <

line 34118=>     'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,' said Frodo. `We <

line 34120=>into it and not out of it.' <
line 34121=>     'I  wouldn't  trust  it,' said Sam, 'not  till  I was dying  of thirst. <
line 34122=> about this  place.' He  sniffed. 'And  a smell, I <

line 34125=> Frodo, `step or stone, breath ir and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.' <
line 34126=>'Yes, that's so,'  said Sam. `And we shouldn't be here at all,  if we'd <

line 34143=> said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real <
line 34144=>tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of <
line 34145=>a  tale it is, happy -ending or sad-ending, but the people  in it don't know.  <
line 34146=>And you don't want them to.' <
line 34147=>     'No, sir, of course not. Beren now,  he  never thought he was  going to <

line 34156=>end  as  tales,' said Frodo.  `But the people in them <
line 34157=>come, and go when their part's ended. Our part will end later  -- or sooner.' <
line 34158=> some rest and  some sleep,' said Sam.  He laughed  <
line 34159=>grimly.  'And I  mean just  that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain ordinary rest, and <
line 34160=>orning's work in the garden. I'm afraid  that's <
line 34161=>all I'm hoping for all the time. All the big important  plans are not for my <

line 34166=>they'll say: "Yes, that's one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave. <
line 34167=>boy, the  famousest of  the hobbits,  and  that's <
line 34168=>saying a lot."' <
line 34169=>much,' said Frodo, and he laughed,  a long clear <
line 34170=>laugh from  his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since <
line 34171=>Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the  stones <
line 34172=>were listen ing and the  tall rocks leaning over them. But Frodo did not heed <
line 34173=>m;  he laughed again. 'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes  me <
line 34174=>ory was already written. But you've left out one of the <
line 34175=>chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. "I  want to hear more about Sam, <
line 34176=>0  in more of his talk, dad? That's  what I like, it <
line 34177=>makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have  got far without Sam, would he, <
line 34178=>dad? <
line 34179=> said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious. ' <
line 34180=>     `So  was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am. We're  going on a bit  too fast. <

line 34184=>on't want to read any more." ' wouldn't be one to say that.  Things done and <
line 34185=>0o part of the great  tales are  different. Why, even Gollum <
line 34186=>might be  good in a  tale,  better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he <
line 34187=>imself once, by his own  account. I wonder if he thinks <
line 34188=>he's the hero or the villain?  <
line 34189=>     `Gollum!' he called. `Would  you like to be the hero  -- now where's  he <

line 34199=>     `It's no  good worrying about him now,'  said  Frodo. `We couldn't have <
line 34200=>got so  far,  not even within  sight of the pass, without  him, and so we'll <
line 34201=>have to put up with his ways. If he's false, he's false.' <
line 34202=>     'All the same, I'd  rather have  him under  my eye,' said Sam. 'All the <

line 34205=>it may  not. Do  you think he's gone to fetch  them, Orcs  or  whatever they <
line 34206=> don't  think  so,'  answered Frodo.  'Even if he's up  to some <
line 34207=>s not unlikely, I don't think it's  that: no t <
line 34208=>I don't think it's  that: no t  or  any servants of the  Enemy.  Why wait till now,  and go <
line 34209=>through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land  he fears? He <
line 34210=>could probably have  betrayed us to Orcs many times since we met him. No, if <
line 34211=>it's  anything,  it wil l  be some  little private trick of  his  own-that he <

line 34213=>e  right, Mr.  Frodo,'  said Sam.  'Not that it <

line 34215=>over  to Orcs  as  gladly  as kiss  his hand.  But  I was forgetting --  his <
line 34216=>Precious. No, I  suppose the  whole  time it's  been The  Precious for  poor <
line 34217=>gol. That's the one idea in  all his little schemes, if he has any.  But <
line 34218=>e will help him in that is more than I can guess.' <
line 34219=>     'Very  likely  he can't guess himself,' said Frodo. `And I don't  think  <
line 34220=>me in his muddled head. I think he really is in <

line 34222=>would be the last  disaster for himself too. if the Enemy got it. And in the <
line 34223=>, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance.' <
line 34224=>     'Yes, Slinker  and Stinker, as I've said before,'  said  Sam.  'But the <
line 34225=>'s land the more like Stinker Slinker will get. <

line 34227=>####-Mark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he  won't let us really take  the <

line 34230=>     'No, but we'd better keep our eyes skinned till we do.  If we're caught <

line 34232=>safe for you to have a wink now, master.  Safe, if you lay close  to me. I'd <

line 34234=>if you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you <
line 34235=>without <
line 34236=>your Sam knowing it.' <
line 34237=>     `Sleep!'  said  Frodo and sighed, as if out of  a desert  he had seen a  <
line 34238=>, even here I could sleep.' <
line 34239=>     `Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.' <
line 34240=>     And so Gollum found  them hours later, when  he returned,  crawling and  <
line 34241=>the gloom ahead. Sam sat  propped against the <
line 34242=>. Sam sat  propped against the ropping  sideways and his   breathing heavy. In his  lap lay <
line 34243=>Frodo's head,  drowned deep in  sleep; upon his white  forehead lay  one  of <
line 34244=>Sam's brown hands, and the  other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace <
line 34245=>was in both their faces.  <
line 34246=>     Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry <
line 34247=>face.  The gleam faded from his eyes,  and they went dim and grey,  old  and  <
line 34248=> of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back <
line 34249=>up towards  the  pass,  shaking  his head, as  if engaged in  some   interior  <
line 34250=>came back, and  slowly  putting out  a trembling  hand, very <
line 34251=>cautiously he touched Frodo's knee  -- but almost the touch was a caress. For  <
line 34252=>  could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have <
line 34253=>thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had <
line 34254=> his time, beyond friends and kin,  and the fields and <
line 34255=>streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing. <
line 34256=> Frodo stirred and cried out softly in  his sleep, and <
line 34257=>immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum  -- <
line 34258=>`pawing <
line 34259=>t. <
line 34260=>hly. `What are you up to?' <
line 34261=>     'Nothing, nothing,' said Gollum softly. `Nice Master!' <
line 34262=>     `I daresay,' said Sam. 'But where have you been to  -- sneaking off and <
line 34263=>0llain? ' <
line 34264=>drew himself, and a green glint  flickered under  his  heavy <
line 34265=>lids. Almost  spider -like  he  looked now, crouched  back on his bent limbs, <
line 34266=>g eyes. The fleeting  moment  had  passed, beyond recall.  <
line 34267=>`Sneaking,  sneaking!'  he  hissed.  'Hobbits always  so polite, yes. O nice <
line 34268=>s them  up secret  ways that  nobody else  could find.  <
line 34269=>Tired he is, thirsty  he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches <

line 34272=>ul, though not more trustful. 'Sorry.' he said. <
line 34273=> you startled me out of my sleep. And I  shouldn't  have been <
line 34274=>sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp.  But Mr.  Frodo.  he's that tired, I <
line 34275=> wink; and well,  that's how it is. Sorry. But where have <
line 34276=>you been to? ' <
line 34277=> Gollum, and the green glint did not leave his  eyes. <
line 34278=>     'O very well,' said Sam, `have it your own way! I don't suppose it's so <
line 34279=>w  we'd  better all  be  sneaking along together. <
line 34280=>What's the time? Is it today or tomorrow? ' <
line 34281=>tomorrow? '      'It's tomorrow,' said Gollum, 'or this  was  tomorrow when hobbits went <
line 34282=>lish, very dangerous-if poor Smjagol wasn't sneaking about <
line 34283=>to watch.' <
line 34284=>get tired  of that word soon,' said Sam. 'But  never  <
line 34285=>mind.  I'll  wake master up.' Gently he smoothed the hair back  fr om Frodo's <
line 34286=>ke softly to him. <
line 34287=>     `Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! ' <
line 34288=> Wake up! ' odo stirred  and  opened  his  eyes,  and  smiled, seeing Sam's  face <
line 34289=>bending ong me early  aren't you,  Sam?' he said. `It's dark <
line 34290=>still!  ' <
line 34291=>     'Yes  it's  always  dark here,' said  Sam. `But Gollum's come  back Mr. <
line 34292=> it's tomorrow. So we must be walking on. The last lap.' <
line 34293=>     Frodo drew a deep breath  and sat up. `The last lap! ' he said. 'Hullo, <
line 34294=> Have you had any rest? ' <
line 34295=>     `No food, no rest, nothing for Smjagol,' said Gollum. `He's a sneak.' <
line 34296=>     Sam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself. <
line 34297=>     'Don't  take  names to  yourself,  Smjagol,'  said Frodo. 'It's  unwise <
line 34298=> or false.' <
line 34299=>o take what's given  him,' answered Gollum. 'He was given <
line 34300=>that name by kind Master Samwise, the hobbit that knows so much.' <
line 34301=><
line 34302=>####-     Frodo looked at Sam. 'Yes sir,' he said. `I did use the word, waking up <
line 34303=>out of my sleep sudden and all  and finding him at hand. I said I was sorry, <
line 34304=>but I soon shan't be.' <
line 34305=>     'Come, let it pass then,' said Frodo. 'But now we seem to have  come to <
line 34306=>the point, you and  I, Smjagol. Tell me. Can we  find the rest of the way by <
line 34307=>We're in sight of  the pass, of a way in, and  if we can find it <

line 34309=>to be over. You have done what nd  you're free: free to go back to food  and rest, wherever  <

line 34312=>at remember me.'   not  yet,'  Gollum whined. `O no!  They  can't  find the way <

line 34323=>     It  may indeed have been  daytime now, as Gollum said, but the  hobbits <

line 34325=>utterly  black,  more like  a  great roof  of smoke; while  instead  of  the <
line 34326=>0which lingered still in  cracks and  holes, a  grey <
line 34327=>blurring shadow shrouded the stony world  about them. They passed on, <
line 34328=>Gollum <
line 34329=>w side by side, up the long  ravine  between the <
line 34330=>piers  and columns of torn and wea thered  rock, standing like huge  unshapen <

line 34332=>ome way ahead, a mile  or so,  a  great  grey  wall,  a   last  huge  upthrusting  mass  of <
line 34333=>mountain-stone. Darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as  they  approached, <
line 34334=>until it towered up high above them, shutting  out the view of all that  lay <
line 34335=>beyond. Deep shadow lay before its feet. Sam sniffed the air. <

line 34339=>is  the entrance to the tunnel.' He did  not speak its name:  Torech  Ungol, <
line 34340=>Shelob's Lair. Out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the <
line 34341=>meads  of  Morgul, but a foul  reek,  as if filth  unnameable were piled and <
line 34342=>0n. <
line 34343=>Smjagol? ' said Frodo. <
line 34344=>     'Yes, yes,' he answered. 'Yes, we must go this way now.' <

line 34347=>linted. `He  doesn't  know  what  we  minds,  does  he <

line 34350=>     `And what makes the smell, I  wonder,'  said Sam. `It's like  -- well, I <

line 34357=>m known such darkness, and if  possible  here it was  deeper and <
line 34358=>s moving,  and echoes,  and a sense  of space. <
line 34359=>choes,  and a sense  of space.  still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as <
line 34360=>it were  in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itsel f that, as  it <
line 34361=>ght blindness not only  to the  eyes but to the mind,  so <
line 34362=>that even the memory of colours and of  forms and of any light faded out  of <
line 34363=>ad been, and always would be, and night was all. <
line 34364=>     But for a while  they could still feel, and  indeed the senses of their <
line 34365=>feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls felt, <
line 34366=> smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was <
line 34367=>straight and even, going ever  up  at the  same stiff slope. The  tunnel was <
line 34368=>ide  that,  though  the hobbits  walked abreast,  only <
line 34369=>touching the side-walls with their  outstretched hands, they were separated, <
line 34370=>ess.  <
line 34371=>0irst and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. While <
line 34372=>they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath <
line 34373=> front of them.  But  after a time their senses <
line 34374=>became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept on, <
line 34375=>groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they <
line 34376=>to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate <
line 34377=>beyond.  <
line 34378=>  very far, perhaps, but time and  distance  soon <
line 34379=>passed out of  his reckoning, Sam on the right, feeling  the wall, was aware <
line 34380=>e side: for a moment he caught a faint breath <
line 34381=>oment he caught a faint breath heavy, and then they passed it by. <
line 34382=>     'There' passage here,'  he whispered with an effort: it <
line 34383=>seemed hard to make his breath give any  sound. `It's as orc-like a place as <
line 34384=>ever there could be! ' <
line 34385=>     After that, first he on  the right, and  then Frodo on the left, passed <
line 34386=>s, some wider, some smaller; but  there was as yet <
line 34387=>no doubt of  the main way,  for it was straight, and did not turn, and still <
line 34388=> was it, how much more of this would they have <
line 34389=>h more of this would they have ould they  endure? The breathlessness of the air was growing <
line 34390=>as they climbed; and now they seemed often  in the  blind dark to sense some <
line 34391=> than  the  foul air. As they  thrust forward they  felt <
line 34392=>things brush against their heads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or  <
line 34393=>erhaps:  they could not tell what  they were. And still the <
line 34394=>stench grew. It grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only <
line 34395=> them. and  that was for their torment.  One  hour,  two <
line 34396=>hours,  three  hours: how many  had  they  passed  in  this  lightless  hole?  <
line 34397=>er. Sam left the tunnel -side and shrank towards Frodo, <
line 34398=>and their hands met and clasped. and so together they still went on. <
line 34399=>     At length Frodo, groping along the  left-hand  wall, came suddenly to a  <
line 34400=>ll sideways  into the emptiness. Here was some  opening in <
line 34401=>the rock far  wider than any  they had yet passed; and out of it came a reek  <
line 34402=>of lurking malice so intense, that Frodo reeled. And at <
line 34403=>that moment Sam too lurched and fell forwards.  <
line 34404=> the sickness and  the fear, Frodo gripped Sam's hand. <
line 34405=>`Up!  ' he said in  a hoarse breath without  voice. 'It all comes from here, <
line 34406=>Now for it! Quick! ' <
line 34407=>     Calling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged Sam to his <
line 34408=>feet, and  forced his own limbs to move. Sam  stumbled beside him. One step, <
line 34409=>two steps, three steps-at last six steps. Maybe they had passed the dreadful <
line 34410=>unseen opening, but  whether  that was so  or not, suddenly it was easier to <
line 34411=>  hostile will  for the moment  had  released  them.  They <
line 34412=>struggled on, still hand in hand. <
line 34413=>d.     But almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel forked, or  <
line 34414=> in the dark they could  not tell wh ich was the wider way, <
line 34415=>or  which kept nearer to the straight. Which should they take, the  left, or  <
line 34416=>w of  nothing  to guide  them, yet a false choice  would <
line 34417=>almost certainly be fatal. <
line 34418=>     `Which way has Gollum gone? ' panted Sam. 'And why didn't he wait? ' <
line 34419=> trying  to  call. 'Smjagol! '  But his voice <
line 34420=>ll. 'Smjagol! '  But his voice  name fell dead almost as  it left his lips.  There  was no <
line 34421=>wer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air. <
line 34422=>ly gone this time, I  fancy,'  muttered Sam. `I guess this is <
line 34423=>just exactly where  he meant to bring us. Gollum! If ever I lay hands on you  <
line 34424=>orry for it.' <
line 34425=>0groping  and fumbling  in  the  dark, they  found  that the <
line 34426=>opening on the left wa s blocked: either it was  a blind, or else  some great <
line 34427=> the passage. 'This can't be the way,'  Frodo whispered. <
line 34428=>'Right or wrong, we must take the other.' <
line 34429=>t or wrong, we must take the other.' ed. 'There's something worse than Gollum about. I  <
line 34430=><
line 34431=>####-can feel something looking at us.' <
line 34432=>g at us.'    They had not gone  more than a  few yards  when from behind them came a  <
line 34433=>sound,  startling and horrible in  the  heavy  padded  silence: a  gurgling, <
line 34434=>ing noise, and  a  long  venomous hiss. They wheeled round, but nothing <
line 34435=> stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not <
line 34436=>0. <
line 34437=>, and he  laid his hand upon  the  hilt  of his <
line 34438=>he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it  <
line 34439=>came. 'I   wish  old  Tom was near us  now!' he  thought.  Then  as he stood, <
line 34440=>0im and a  blackness of  despair and  anger in his heart. it <
line 34441=>seemed  to him that he saw a  light:  a light in his mind, almost unbearably <
line 34442=>bright at first, as a sun-ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless  <
line 34443=>pit. Then  the light became colour: green,  gold, silver, white. Far off, as <
line 34444=>in  a  little  picture drawn  by  elven-fingers  he  saw  the Lady Galadriel <
line 34445=>n the  grass  in  Lurien,  and gifts  were  in her hands. And you, <
line 34446=>ay,  remote  but clear, for you  I have prepared  <
line 34447=>he bubbling hiss  drew nearer,  and there  was a  creaking as  of some <
line 34448=> moved with slow purpose in the dark. A reek came on <
line 34449=>before it. 'Master, master!' cried Sam, and the  life and  urgency came back  <
line 34450=>into his vo  gift! The star-glass! A light  to you  in  dark <
line 34451=>aid it was to be. The star-glass!  ' <
line 34452=> was to be. The star-glass!  ' tered Frodo, as one answering out of sleep, hardly <
line 34453=>comprehending.  `Why  yes! Why had  I forgotten it? A  light when all  other <
line 34454=>light alone can help us.' <
line 34455=>     Slowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held  aloft the  Phial <
line 34456=>of Galadriel. For a moment it glimmered, faint as  a rising star  struggling <
line 34457=>in heavy earthward  mists,  and then as its power waxed,  and hope  grew  in <
line 34458=>  burn, and kindled to a  silver flame, a  minute <
line 34459=>heart of dazzling light, as though Edrendil  had himself come down  from the <
line 34460=> Silmaril upon his brow. The darkness receded <
line 34461=>his brow. The darkness receded seemed to shine in the  centre of a globe of  airy crystal, <
line 34462=>and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire. <
line 34463=>     Frodo gazed  in   wonder at this marvellous  gift  that  he  had so long <
line 34464=> worth and potency. Seldom had  he remembered <
line 34465=>ncy. Seldom had  he remembered ntil they came to Morgul Vale, and never had he used it for  <
line 34466=>fear of its revealing  light.  Aiya Edrendil Elenion Ancalima! he cried, and <
line 34467=> he had spoken; for it seemed that another voice spoke through <
line 34468=>his, clear, untroubled by the foul air of the pit. <
line 34469=>     But other  potencies  there are in  Middle-earth, powers of night,  and <
line 34470=>She that  walked in the darkness had heard the <
line 34471=> in the darkness had heard the ry far back in the deeps of time, and she had not heeded it, <
line 34472=>and it did  not daunt her now. Even as Frodo spoke he  felt  a great  malice <
line 34473=>bent upon him, and a deadly regard considering him. Not far down the tunnel, <
line 34474=>between them  and the  opening where  they  had reeled and stumbled, he  was <
line 34475=>isible, two great clusters  of many-windowed eyes  -- <
line 34476=>the  coming menace was unmasked at last.  The radiance of the star -gla ss was <
line 34477=>0om their thousand  facets, but behind the glitter a  <
line 34478=>pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame kindled in some deep <
line 34479=>ous and  abominable eyes they were, bestial  and  <
line 34480=>yet filled with purpose  and with  hideous delight, gloating over their prey <
line 34481=>pe. <
line 34482=>r -stricken, began slowly to back away,  their own <
line 34483=>gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so  <
line 34484=>and wavered, and slowly the Phial drooped. Then <
line 34485=>suddenly,  released from  the  holding spell to run  a little while  in vain <
line 34486=>panic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but <
line 34487=>odo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes <
line 34488=>came leaping up behind. The stench of death was like a cloud about him. <

line 34490=>perately. `Running is no use.'  nearer. <
line 34491=>`Running is no use.'  nearer. called, and  gathering his  courage  he  lifted up the <
line 34492=>Phial once more. The eyes  halted. For a moment  their regard relaxed, as if <
line 34493=>some hint of doubt troubled them. Then Frodo's heart flamed  within him, and <
line 34494=>without thinking what he did, whether it was folly or despair or  courage, he <
line 34495=>hand,  and  with his right hand drew his sword. <
line 34496=>ut, and the sharp elven-blade  sparkled in the silver  light, <
line 34497=>but at  its edges a  blue fire  flicked. Then holding the star aloft and the <
line 34498=>ed,  Frodo,  hobbit of the Shire, walked steadily down to <
line 34499=>meet the eyes. <
line 34500=>ubt  came into them as the light approached. One by one <
line 34501=>they dimmed,  and  slowly they drew back. No brightness so  deadly  had ever  <
line 34502=> From sun  and  moon and star  they  had  been  safe <
line 34503=>underground,  but now a star  had descended  into  the  very earth. Still it <
line 34504=>es began to quail. One by one they all went dark; they <
line 34505=>turned  away, and a great bulk,  beyond  the light's reach,  heaved its huge <
line 34506=>re gone. <
line 34507=> cried Sam. He was close behind,  his own  sword drawn <
line 34508=>and ready. 'Stars  and glory!  But the Elves would make a song  of  that, if <
line 34509=> may I live   to tell them and hear them sing.  But <
line 34510=>don't go  on, master. Don't go down to that den! Now's our only chance.  Now <
line 34511=>le!' <
line 34512=>ned once more, first walking and then running; for  <
line 34513=>as they  went the  floor  of   the tunnel rose steeply, and with every stride <
line 34514=>the stenches  of  the  unseen lair, and strength <
line 34515=>returned  to  limb and  heart.  But still the hatred of  the  Watcher lurked <
line 34516=>behind  them, blind for a while,  perhaps,  but undefeated,  still  bent  on <
line 34517=>ere came  a  flow of air  to meet them, cold and thin. The <
line 34518=>opening, the tunnel's end, at last it was before them. Panting, yearning for  <
line 34519=>y flung themselves forward, and  then in amazement they <
line 34520=>staggered, tumbling back. The outlet was blocked  with some barrier, but not <
line 34521=>0ittle  yielding  it  seemed,  and  yet  strong  and <
line 34522=>impervious; air filtered through, hut not a  glimmer of any light. Once more <
line 34523=>back. <
line 34524=>0ial Frodo looked and  before him he  saw a greyness <
line 34525=>which the radiance of the star-glass did not pierce  and did not illuminate, <
line 34526=>at  being cast  by  no  light,  no  light could <
line 34527=>dissipate. Across the  width and height of the  tunnel a  vast web was spun, <
line 34528=>orderly as the web of some huge spider,  but  denser -woven  and far greater,  <
line 34529=>0as as thick as rope. <
line 34530=>     Sam  laughed grimly.  `Cobwebs! '  he said. `Is that all?  Cobwebs! But <
line 34531=>what a spider! Have at 'em, down with 'em! ' <
line 34532=>e at 'em, down with 'em! '  he  hewed at  them with his  sword,  but  the thread  that he <
line 34533=>struck did  not break.  It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked <
line 34534=>g the blade and tossing up both sword and a rm. Three times <
line 34535=>Sam struck with all  his  force, and  at last  one single cord  of  all  the <
line 34536=>ped and twisted, curling and whipping through  the air.  <
line 34537=>One end of it lashed Sam's hand, and he cried out in pain, starting back and <
line 34538=> his mouth. <
line 34539=>days to clear the road like this,' he said. `What's to be <
line 34540=>done? Have those eyes come back? ' <
line 34541=>? ' ####-     `No, not  to be seen,' said  Frodo.  `But  I still  feel  that they are <
line 34542=>looking at me,  or  thinking about me: making some  other plan,  perhaps. If <
line 34543=>this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.' <
line 34544=> end!  ' said Sam bitterly, his anger rising again above <
line 34545=>weariness and despair. `Gnats  in a net. May the curse of Faramir bite  that <
line 34546=>Gollum and bite him quick! ' <
line 34547=>     'That would not help us now,' said Frodo. `Come! Let us see what  Sting <
line 34548=>can  do. It is an elven-blade. There were webs of horror in the dark ravines <
line 34549=>ged.  But you must be the  guard and hold back <
line 34550=>st be the  guard and hold back  take  the  star -glass.  Do  not be afraid. Hold  it  up and <
line 34551=>watch!' <
line 34552=>     Then Frodo stepped up to the great grey  net, and hewed it  with a wide <
line 34553=>troke,  drawing  the  bitter  edge  swiftly  across  a  ladder  of <
line 34554=>close-strung cords, and  at  once  springing  away. The  blue-gleaming blade <
line 34555=>them like a scythe through grass, and they  leaped and writhed <
line 34556=>and then hung loose. A great rent was made. <
line 34557=> loose. A great rent was made.  stroke he dealt, until at last  all the  web within  his <
line 34558=>reach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil  <
line 34559=>The trap was broken. <
line 34560=>     `Come! ' cried Frodo. `On! On! ' Wild joy at their escape from the very <
line 34561=>illed  all his mind. His head whirled as  with a  <
line 34562=>draught of potent wine. He sprang out, shouting as he came. <
line 34563=>ight in that  dark land to his eyes  that had passed through <
line 34564=>the den of night. The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last  <
line 34565=>day were passing; the red glare of Mordor had died away in <
line 34566=>sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden <
line 34567=>ached  the  summit of the  wall. Only  a little higher  <
line 34568=>now. The Cleft,  Cirith  Ungol, was before him, a dim  notch  in  the  black  <
line 34569=>rock darkling  in  the sky on either side.  A  short <
line 34570=>race, a sprinter's course and he would be through!  <
line 34571=> ' he  cried, not heeding the shrillness of  his voice, <
line 34572=>that  released  from  the choking airs of the  tunnel  rang out now high and <
line 34573=>0n, and we'll be  through-through before any one can <

line 34575=>st as he could  urge his legs; but glad as he <
line 34576=> urge his legs; but glad as he he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on  glancing back  at <
line 34577=>the dark  arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some  shape beyond his <
line 34578=>ing out in  pursuit. Too little did he or  his master know of <
line 34579=>the craft of Shelob. She had many exits from her  lair. <
line 34580=>     There agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider -form, even such as <
line 34581=>0the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under  <

line 34584=> the hemlocks in the moonlight lob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out  of the <
line 34585=>Dark  Years  few tales  have come. But still she was  there, who  was  there <
line 34586=>nd before the first  stone of Barad-dyr; and she served none <
line 34587=>but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with <
line 34588=>endless  brooding on her  feasts,  weaving  webs of shadow;  for all  living <
line 34589=>things  were  her  food,  and her  vomit  darkness.  Far and wide her lesser  <
line 34590=>broods, bastards  of the miserable mates, her own offspring,  that she slew,  <
line 34591=>rom  glen to glen, from the Ephel DÂ®ath to the eastern hills, to Dol <
line 34592=>0 of Mirkwood. But none could  rival her, Shelob the <
line 34593=> child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world. <
line 34594=>  years before, Gollum had beheld her, Smjagol  who  pried into <
line 34595=>ys he had  bowed  and worshipped her, and the <
line 34596=>d  and worshipped her, and the evil will  walked through  all  the ways of  his  weariness <
line 34597=>beside him, cutting  him off from light and from regret. And he had promised <
line 34598=>to bring  her food. But her lust was  not his lust. Little  she  knew of  or  <
line 34599=>cared for towers, or  rings, or  anything devised by mind  or hand, who only  <
line 34600=>thers, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life. <
line 34601=>alone,  swollen  till  the  mountains  could no longer  hold her up and  the <

line 34649=> light deep into  a pocket near his breast and drew his <
line 34650=>elven-cloak about him.  Now he tried  to  quicken his pace.  His master  was <
line 34651=>0eady he was some twenty strides ahead, flitting on like a  <
line 34652=>shadow; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world. <
line 34653=>     Hardly had  Sam hidden the light  of  the star -glass  when she came.  A <
line 34654=>0is left he saw suddenly, issuing  from a black hole <
line 34655=>of  shadow under the cliff, the most loathly  shape that he had ever beheld, <
line 34656=> an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but <
line 34657=>huger than  the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of <
line 34658=>the evil  purpose  in her remorseless eyes.  Those  same  eyes  that  he had <
line 34659=> defeated, there  they were lit with a fell light  again, <
line 34660=>clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short <
line 34661=>r huge swollen body,  a vast bloated bag, swaying  and <
line 34662=>sagging  between  her legs; its great  bulk was black,  blotched  with livid <
line 34663=>rneath  was pale  and  luminous  and  gave forth a  <
line 34664=>stench. Her legs were bent, with great  knobbed joints high  above her back, <
line 34665=> steel spines, and at each leg's end  there was <
line 34666=>a claw. <
line 34667=>     As soon as she had  squeezed her  soft  squelching  body and its folded <
line 34668=>xit from her lair, she moved with a  horrible speed, <
line 34669=>now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. She was <
line 34670=>between <
line 34671=> she did  not see Sam, or she avoided him for the <
line 34672=>moment as  the bearer of the  light` and fixed all her intent upon one prey, <
line 34673=>al, running heedless up the path, unaware yet <
line 34674=>dless up the path, unaware yet iftly he ran, but Shelob was  swifter;  in a few  leaps she <
line 34675=>would have him. <
line 34676=>     Sam gasped and gathered  all his  remaining breath  to shout. 'Look out <
line 34677=>nd!  ' he yelled.  'Look  out  master!  I'm'  -- but suddenly his cry was <
line 34678=> clammy hand went over his mouth and  another caught  him  by the <
line 34679=> itself about his leg.  Taken off  his guard he <
line 34680=>toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker. <
line 34681=>m in his ear. `At  last, my precious, we've got <
line 34682=>him, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She'll get the other. O yes, <
line 34683=>Shelob will get him,  not Smjagol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all. <
line 34684=>ou nassty filthy little sneak!' He spat on Sam's neck. <
line 34685=>     Fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was <
line 34686=>o Sam  a sudden violence and strength that was far <
line 34687=><
line 34688=>####-beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he <
line 34689=>  himself  could have twisted  more quickly  or more <
line 34690=>fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged <
line 34691=>forward <
line 34692=>from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in <
line 34693=>his hand, and on his   left arm,  hanging by  its thong, was Faramir's staff.  <
line 34694=> and stab his enemy. But Gollum  was too quick. <
line 34695=>His long right arm shot out, and he  grabbed  Sam's wrist:  his fingers were <
line 34696=>like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till <
line 34697=>Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all <
line 34698=>the while Gollum's other hand was tightening on Sam's throat. <
line 34699=>     Then Sam played his last trick. With all his  strength  he  pulled away <
line 34700=>planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the <
line 34701=>ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards. <
line 34702=>ting  even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell  over with <
line 34703=>Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in  his stomach.  <
line 34704=>out  of him, and  for a second his hand upon  Sam's throat <
line 34705=>loosened;  but his  fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam  tore  himself <
line 34706=>nd stood up, and then  quickly he wheeled away  to his <
line 34707=>right,  pivoted on the  wrist held by Gollum.  Laying hold of the staff with <
line 34708=> it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on <
line 34709=>Gollum's outstretched arm, just below the elbow.  <
line 34710=>0 let go. Then  Sam  waded in; not waiting to change  <
line 34711=>the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick as  a snake <
line 34712=> the stroke aimed at his head  fell  across  his <
line 34713=>back. The staff  cracked and broke.  That was  enough for him. Grabbing from <
line 34714=>behind  was an old game of his,  and  seldom  had he failed in it.  But this <
line 34715=>pite,  he  had made the  mistake  of speaking and gloating <
line 34716=>before he had  both hands on his  victim's  neck. Everything  had gone wrong <
line 34717=>an,  since that horrible  light  had  so  unexpectedly <
line 34718=>appeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a furious  enemy, <
line 34719=>ize. This fight was not for him. Sam  swept up his <
line 34720=>sword from the ground and raised it. Gollum squealed , and springing aside on <
line 34721=> in one big bound like a frog. Before Sam could <
line 34722=>reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel.  <
line 34723=>     Sword in  hand  Sam  went  after him.  For the  moment he had forgotten  <
line 34724=> the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum. <
line 34725=><
line 34726=>####-But before he could overtake him, Gollum  was gone. Then  as the  dark  hole <
line 34727=>0and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder  <
line 34728=>the thought of Frodo  and the monster  smote upon Sam's mind. He spun round, <
line 34729=> the path, calling and calling his master's name. He was <
line 34730=>too late. So far Gollum's plot had succeeded. <

line 34735=>over  him, so intent  upon her victim  that she took  no heed of Sam and his <
line 34736=>cries, until  he was close at  hand. As he rushed up he  saw that Frodo  was <
line 34737=>  cords, wound about him from ankle to  shoulder,  and the  <
line 34738=>monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his <
line 34739=>the near side of him lay, gleaming on  the ground, his elven-blade,  <
line 34740=>where it hs from his grasp. Sam did not wait to  wonder wha t  <
line 34741=>was to be  done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage.  He <
line 34742=> and seized his master's sword in his left hand. <
line 34743=>Then he charged.  No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world <
line 34744=>of beasts; where  some  desperate  small creature  armed with  little  teeth <
line 34745=>ng  upon a tower of horn and  hide that  stands above  its <
line 34746=>fallen mate. <
line 34747=>ut of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned <
line 34748=>slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was <
line 34749=> her greater than any she  had known in  countless <
line 34750=>years,  the shining sword  bit upon her  foot  and shore away  the claw. Sam <
line 34751=>f  her legs, and  with a quick  upthrust of his <
line 34752=>other hand stabbed at  the clustered eyes upon her lowered  head. One  great <
line 34753=>eye went dark. <
line 34754=>0erable creature was right under her, for the  moment out of <
line 34755=>the reach of her  sting and of her claws.  Her vast belly was above him with <
line 34756=> the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury <
line 34757=>held for  one more blow, and  before she could sink upon him, smothering him <
line 34758=>0nce of courage, he  slashed  the bright elven-blade <
line 34759=>across her with desperate strength. <
line 34760=>strength. ut Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her <
line 34761=>ed  with corruption  was her  age-old hide, but ever  <
line 34762=>thickened from within with  layer on layer of evil  growth. The blade scored <
line 34763=>t those hideous folds could not be pierced by any <
line 34764=>strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should  forge the steel or the hand  <
line 34765=>. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up <
line 34766=><
line 34767=>####-the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head. Poison frothed and bubbled <
line 34768=>ng her legs she drove her huge  bulk down  on <
line 34769=> drove her huge  bulk down  on  soon.  For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping  his own <
line 34770=>sword, with both hands he  held the  elven-blade  point upwards, fending off  <
line 34771=>of; and  so  Shelob, with  the driving force of her own cruel <
line 34772=>0ill, with  strength greater than  any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a  <
line 34773=>biep,  deep it pricked, as Sam was  crushed  slowly  to  the <
line 34774=>nd. <
line 34775=>Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in  all <

line 34781=>a convulsive leap.  to his knees by Frodo's head, his senses  reeling in the <

line 34786=>him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom,  and a green ooze trickling from <
line 34787=>e crouched, her shuddering belly splayed <
line 34788=>, her shuddering belly splayed  great bows of her legs quivering, as she  gather ed  herself <
line 34789=>for another spring-this time to crush  and sting to death: no little bite of <

line 34793=>ht came  to him, as  if some remote voice had  spoken. and he <
line 34794=>fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and <
line 34795=>t seemed to  his touch  in a phantom world of horror, the <
line 34796=>Phial of Galadriel. <
line 34797=>!  ' he said  faintly, and  then he heard voices far off  but <
line 34798=>clear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved <
line 34799=>shadows of the  Shire, and  the music  of the Elves as  it came  through his <
line 34800=>sleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond. <
line 34801=>Elbereth! <
line 34802=><
line 34803=>####-     And then his tongue was loosed and  his voice cried in a language which  <

line 34812=>you'll pay for it. We're going on; but we'll settle with you first. Come on, <
line 34813=>and taste it again!' <
line 34814=>     As  if his indomitable spirit had set  its potency in motion, the glass <
line 34815=>blazed  suddenly like a white torch in his  hand. It flamed like a star that <
line 34816=>leaping from the firmament sears  the  dark  air with  intolerable light. No <
line 34817=>en had ever burned in Shelob's face before. The beams <
line 34818=>of it entered into her wounded head  and scored it with unbearable pain, and <
line 34819=> light  spread  from  eye to  eye. She  fell back  <
line 34820=>beating  the air with her  forelegs, her   sight blasted by inner lightnings,  <
line 34821=>rning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and <
line 34822=>began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind. <
line 34823=>     Sam came  on. He was reeling like a drunken man,  but he came  on.  And <
line 34824=>t, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered  as she  tried <
line 34825=>to  hasten from him. She  reached  the hole,  and  squeezing down, leaving a  <
line 34826=>slime, she slipped in, even as Sam hewed a last stroke <
line 34827=>at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground. <

line 34835=>0ejoicing  to be  free,  Shelob  with hideous speed had come <
line 34836=>behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale, <
line 34837=>nd did not move. <
line 34838=>     `Master, dear  master! ' said Sam, and through  a long  silence waited. <

line 34848=>bbing the air,  and smiting the  stones, and shouting  challenges.  <
line 34849=> bending looked at Frodo's face, pale beneath him <
line 34850=>in the  dusk.  And  suddenly  he  saw that he was  in the  picture  that was <
line 34851=>f Galadriel in Lurien: Frodo with a pale face <
line 34852=>Lurien: Frodo with a pale face  under  a great  dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had  thought <

line 34854=>the words had set the venom to its work again. it seemed to him that the hue <
line 34855=>of the face grew livid green. <
line 34856=>     And  then black despair came down  on him, and Sam bowed to the ground, <
line 34857=>and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into  his heart, and he <

line 34866=>words <
line 34867=>that at the time he  did not  understand  himself, at the beginning of their <
line 34868=>mething to do before the end. I must see  it through, sir, <

line 34870=>can I do? Not leave  Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on  the  top of <
line 34871=>the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?' he repeated, and for  a <
line 34872=>moment <
line 34873=>doubt and fear  shook him. `Go on?  Is  that what I've  got to do? And leave <
line 34874=>him?' <
line 34875=> weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body, <
line 34876=>d his cold hands upon his breast,  and wrapped his cloak about him; <
line 34877=>and he laid  his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given <
line 34878=>at the other. <
line 34879=>     'If I'm  to  go on,' he  said,  `then  I must take your sword,  by your <

line 34900=>again,  and now he seemed  plainly to know the hard  answer: see it through. <
line 34901=>, and the worst. <
line 34902=>     `What? Me, alone, go  to the Crack of Doom and all? ' He quailed still, <
line 34903=>but the resolve grew. `What? Me take  the Ring from him? The Council gave it <

line 34905=>     But the answer came at  once: `And the  Council gave him companions, so <

line 34908=>     `I wish I wasn't the last,' he groaned. `I wish old Gandalf was hare or  <

line 34915=>     `Ah well, I must make up my  own mind. I  will  make it up. But I'll be <

line 34922=>and  get advice or permission.  No, it's sit here till they come and kill me <

line 34924=>'Then take It, it is! ' <
line 34925=>y gently he undid  the clasp at the neck and slipped his <
line 34926=>hand inside Frodo's tunic;  then with his other  hand raising the  head,  he <
line 34927=>kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over  it.  And  then the <
line 34928=>head lay quietly back again in rest. No change came over the still face, and <
line 34929=>by that  more than by all  other tokens Sam was convinced at last that Frodo  <
line 34930=>laid aside the Quest. <
line 34931=>     `Good-bye, master,  my dear! ' he  murmured. 'Forgive  your Sam.  He'll <

line 34945=>bitter comfort of that last sight Sam  turned and hid the light and stumbled <
line 34946=>on into the growing dark. <
line 34947=>     He  had not far to go.  The  tunnel was some way  behind;  the  Cleft a  <
line 34948=>couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in  the dusk` a  <
line 34949=>n in  ages of  passage,  running  now gently up in a long trough <
line 34950=>e trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came  to a  <
line 34951=><
line 34952=>####-long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the orc-tower  was right  above him, <
line 34953=>he red eye  glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark <
line 34954=>shadow under it. He was coming to the top of  the steps and was in the Cleft  <
line 34955=>my  mind,' he kept saying to himself.  But  he  had not. <
line 34956=>Though  he  had done his best  to  think it  out,  what  he  was  doing  was <
line 34957=>rain  of his nature.  `Have  I  got it  wrong? '  he <
line 34958=>muttered. `What ought I to have done? ' <
line 34959=> done? '     As the sheer sides of the Cleft closed about him, before he reached the <
line 34960=>ore  he looked  at last on the  path descending into  the <
line 34961=>Nameless Land. he turned. For a moment, motionless  in intolerable doubt, he <
line 34962=>till see, like a small blot in  the gathering  gloom, <
line 34963=>the mouth  of the tunnel; and he thought he could see or  guess where  Frodo  <
line 34964=>a glimmer on the ground  down there, or perhaps it <
line 34965=>was some trick of his tears, as he peered out at that high stony place where <
line 34966=>n. <
line 34967=>y wish, my one wish,' he sighed, `to go back and <
line 34968=>find him! '  Then  at last he turned to  the  road in front and took  a  few <
line 34969=>steps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken. <
line 34970=>     Only a few steps; and now only a  few more and  he would be going  down <
line 34971=> that high place again. And then suddenly  he heard cries <
line 34972=>and voices. He stood still as  stone.  Orc-voices. They were behind him  and <
line 34973=> tramping feet and harsh shouts:  Orcs were coming up <
line 34974=>to  the  Cleft from the  far side, from  some entry to  the tower,  perhaps.  <
line 34975=>ehind. He  wheeled round. He saw small red lights, <
line 34976=>torches, winking away below there as they  issued  from the tunnel. At  last  <
line 34977=>of the tower had not been blind. He was caught. <
line 34978=>     Now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was <
line 34979=>very near. In a  minute they would reach the top and be on  him. He had taken <
line 34980=> up his mind, and now it was no good. How could he escape, <
line 34981=>or save himself, or save the Ring? The Ring. He was not aware of any thought <
line 34982=>y found himself drawing  out the  chain and taking the <
line 34983=>Ring in his hand.  The head of  the  orc-company appeared in the Cleft right  <
line 34984=>0t on. <
line 34985=>0nd a single moment of time was filled with an  hour  <
line 34986=>of thought. At once he was aware that  hearing was sharpened while sight was <
line 34987=>n  Shelob's  lair. All things about him now were <
line 34988=><
line 34989=>####-not dark but vague; while he himself was there in  a grey hazy world, alone,  <
line 34990=>0rock and the Ring, weighing down his left hand, was <
line 34991=>like an orb of hot gold. He did not feel invisible at  all, but horribly and <
line 34992=> that somewhere an Eye was searching for him. <
line 34993=> an Eye was searching for him.   crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in Morgul <
line 34994=>Vale;  and down away under the rock the bubbling misery  of Shelob, groping, <
line 34995=>lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the <
line 34996=>cries of the Orcs  as they came out of the tunnel; and deafening, roaring in <
line 34997=>0e feet  a nd the  rending clamour of the Orcs before <
line 34998=>him.  He  shrank  against the cliff. But  they marched  up  like  a  phantom <
line 34999=>gures in a mist, only  dreams of  fear with pale <
line 35000=>flames in their hands. And they passed him  by. He  cowered , trying to creep  <
line 35001=>ide. <
line 35002=>s from the tunnel and the others marching down had <
line 35003=>sighted one another,  and  both parties were now hurrying  and  shouting. He <
line 35004=>e understood what they  said. Perhaps the Ring <
line 35005=>t they  said. Perhaps the Ring ng of tongues,  or simply  understanding, especially  of the  <
line 35006=>servants  of  Sauron  its maker, so that if he gave heed,  he understood and <
line 35007=>translated  the thought  to himself. Certainly the Ring had grown greatly in <
line 35008=>power  as it approached the places of its forging; but one  thing it did not <
line 35009=>ourage. At present Sam  still thought only of hiding, <
line 35010=>of lying low till all  was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. He  could <
line 35011=>s were, the words seemed almost in his ears.  <
line 35012=>ds seemed almost in his ears.  g! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already? ' <
line 35013=>     'Orders, you lubber. And what are  you doing, Shagrat? Tired of lurking <
line 35014=> coming down to fight? ' <
line 35015=>     'Orders to  you.  I'm in command  of this pass.  So speak civil. What's <
line 35016=>your report?  ' <
line 35017=>     'Nothing.' <
line 35018=>  A yell  broke into the exchanges of the leaders. The <
line 35019=>Orcs lower down  had  suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the <
line 35020=>Here's something! Lying right in  the road. A spy, a spy! ' <
line 35021=>There was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices.  <
line 35022=>     With a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood. They <
line 35023=> What would they do? He had heard tales of the Orcs to make <
line 35024=><
line 35025=>####-the blood run cold. It could not be borne. He  sprang up. He flung the Quest  <
line 35026=>and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them.  He knew now where <
line 35027=>his place was  and had been: at  his master's side, though what he  could do <
line 35028=>ar. Back  he  ran down the  steps, down the  path  towards <
line 35029=>Frodo. <
line 35030=>he  thought. `Thirty or forty  from the tower at <
line 35031=>least, and  a  lot more than  that  from down below, I guess. How many can I <
line 35032=>kill before they get  me? They'll see the flame of  the  sword, as soon as I <
line 35033=>ll get me  sooner or later. I wonder if any song will ever  <
line 35034=>mention it: How Samwise  fell  in  the High Pass and made  a wall of  bodies <
line 35035=>  no song. Of course not, for the Ring'll be found, and <
line 35036=>there'll be  no more songs. I can't help it. My place is  by Mr. Frodo. They <
line 35037=>0 Elrond  and the Council, and  the  great Lords and <
line 35038=>Ladies with all their wisdom. Their plans  have gone wrong. I can't be their <
line 35039=>Frodo.' <
line 35040=>  out  of his dim sight now. He  had  had no  time to <
line 35041=>consider himself, but now he  realized  that he was  weary, weary almost  to  <
line 35042=> not carry him as he wished. He was  too slow. The <
line 35043=>path seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist?  <
line 35044=>     There they were  again!  A good way  ahead still. A cluster of  figures <
line 35045=>ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and <
line 35046=>that, bent like dogs on a trail. He tried to make a spurt. <
line 35047=>  ' he said, `or you'll be too late  again.' He  loosened <
line 35048=>the sword in its sheath. In a minute he would draw it, and then-- <
line 35049=>     There was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted <
line 35050=> hoi! Ya harri hoi! Up! Up! ' <
line 35051=>     Then a  voice shouted: `Now off! The quick way. Back to  the Undergate! <
line 35052=>She'll  not  trouble us  tonight  by  all  the signs.'  The  whole  band  of <
line 35053=>orc-figures  began  to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on <
line 35054=>i!  ' <
line 35055=>0's body. They were off. He could not catch them up. <
line 35056=>Still he laboured on. The Orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those <
line 35057=>, and  behind them  there  was a  good  deal of <
line 35058=>struggling  and  jostling. Sam came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue <
line 35059=>in his  wavering hand, but they did not see it. Even as  he came panting up, <
line 35060=>nished into the black hole. <
line 35061=>     For a moment he stood, gasping,  clutching his breast. Then he drew his <
line 35062=><
line 35063=>####-sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears.  'Curse <
line 35064=>the filth! ' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness.  <
line 35065=>     It no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if <
line 35066=>ut of  a thin mist into  a heavier fog. His  weariness was <
line 35067=>growing but his will  hardened  all the more. He thought  he  could  see the <
line 35068=>tle way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch <
line 35069=>them up. Orcs go fast in tunnels, and this  tunnel  they  knew well.; for in <
line 35070=>forced  to use it  often as the swiftest  way from <
line 35071=>the Dead City over the mountains. In  what far -off time  the main tunnel and <
line 35072=>  made, where Shelob had  taken up her abode in <
line 35073=>ages past. they did not  know: but many byways they  had  themselves  delved <
line 35074=>about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro <
line 35075=> their masters.  Tonight they  did not intend to  go  far <
line 35076=>down. but  were  hastening to find  a side-passage  that  led back  to their <
line 35077=>ff. Must of  them were gleeful,  delighted with  what <
line 35078=>they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the <
line 35079=>heard the  noise  of their harsh voices, flat and <
line 35080=>hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the <
line 35081=>rer to him. The  captains of the  two parties <
line 35082=>  captains of the  two parties nging up the rear, debating as they went. <
line 35083=>      your rabble  making such a racket, Shagrat? '  grunted <
line 35084=>the one. `We don't want Shelob on us.' <
line 35085=>he one. `We don't want Shelob on us.'  making  more than half the noise,'  said the <
line 35086=>othe  lads play! No need to worry about  Shelob for a bit, I <
line 35087=>kon. She's sat on a nail, it  seems, and we shan't cry about that. Didn't  <
line 35088=>ss all the way  back to  that cursed crack  of  hers? If <
line 35089=>we've stopped it once, we've stopped it  a  hundred times. So let 'em laugh. <
line 35090=>f luck at last: got something that LugbÂ®rz wants.' <
line 35091=>     'LugbÂ®rz wants it, eh? What is it, d'you think? Elvish it looked to me, <
line 35092=>anger in a thing like that? ' <
line 35093=>     'Don't know till we've had a look.' <
line 35094=>'t know till we've had a look.' en't  told you what to expect? They don't tell us all <
line 35095=>they  know, do  they? Not by  half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top <
line 35096=>g!'  Shagrat's voice  was  lowered, so  tha t  even  with  his <
line 35097=>strangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just  catch  what was said. 'They <
line 35098=>ot eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as <
line 35099=><
line 35100=>####-not.  But there's no  doubt about it, they're troubled about something.  The <
line 35101=>ow are, by your account; and LugbÂ®rz is too. Something <
line 35102=>nearly <
line 35103=>y! ' said Gorbag. <
line 35104=>     `All right,' said Shagrat, `but we'll  talk of that later: Wait till we <
line 35105=> a place there where  we can talk a bit, while <
line 35106=>here  we can talk a bit, while  <
line 35107=>re  we can talk a bit, while  saw the  torches  disappear. Then there  was a  <
line 35108=>rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as  he could guess <
line 35109=>the Orcs  had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo  and  he  had <
line 35110=>ocked. It was still blocked. <
line 35111=>     There  seemed to be a  great stone  in  the  way,  but the Orcs had got <
line 35112=>through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were <
line 35113=>still running  along, deeper and deeper into the mountain,  back towards the <
line 35114=>e. They were carrying off his master's body for some <
line 35115=>foul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and <
line 35116=>, but it did not  yield. Then not far inside, or <
line 35117=>so he thought,  he  heard the two captains' voices talking  again.  He stood <
line 35118=>still  listening  for a little  hoping  perhaps  to learn something  useful. <
line 35119=>o seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and <
line 35120=>he <
line 35121=>could then slip in. <
line 35122=>     `No,  I  don't  know,' said  Gorbag's voice. `The messages  go  through <
line 35123=>quicker  than anything could fly, as a rule. But I  don't  enquire how  it's <
line 35124=>o. Grr! Those Nazgyl give me the creeps. And they skin the <
line 35125=>body off you as soon as  look at you, and leave  you all cold in the  dark on <
line 35126=>He likes 'em;  they're His favourites nowadays, so it's <
line 35127=>no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving down in the city.' <
line 35128=>     `You should try being up here with Shelob for company,' said Shagrat. <
line 35129=>y somewhere where there's  none of 'em. But the war's on <
line 35130=>now, and when that's over things may be easier.' <
line 35131=>l, they say.' <
line 35132=>0' grunted  Gorbag. `We'll  see. But anyway, if  it does  go <
line 35133=>well,  there should  be  a lot more  room. What d'you  say?   -- if we get  a <
line 35134=>l slip  off  and set up somewhere on our  own with a few <
line 35135=>trusty lads, somewhere  where there's good  loot nice and handy, and no  big  <
line 35136=>h! ' said Shagrat. `Like old times.' <
line 35137=>aid Shagrat. `Like old times.' But don't count on it. I'm not easy in my mind. As <
line 35138=>I  said, the Big Bosses, ay,' his voice  sank almost to a whisper, `ay, even <
line 35139=>the  Biggest,  can  make mistakes. Something  nearly slipped you say. I say, <
line 35140=>ipped. And we've got to  look out. Always the poor  Uruks to <
line 35141=>put slips right, and small thanks. But don't forget: the enemies don't  love <
line 35142=>us  any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we're done <
line 35143=>too. But see here: when were you ordered out? ' <
line 35144=>     `About an hour ago,  just  before you  saw us.  A message  came: Nazgyl <
line 35145=>uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to  head of Stairs. <
line 35146=>0ad business,'  said Gorbag.  `See  here  -- our Silent  Watchers were <
line 35147=>uneasy mo ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out <
line 35148=>for another  day, nor any message sent to LugbÂ®rz either: owing to the Great <
line 35149=>h Nazgyl going off to the war, and all that. And <
line 35150=>then they couldn't get LugbÂ®rz to pay attention for a good while, I'm told.' <
line 35151=>re,  I  suppose,'  said Shagrat.  `Big things <
line 35152=>,'  said Shagrat.  `Big things t, they say.' <
line 35153=>t.  `Big things t, they say.'  growled Gorbag.  `But in the meantime enemies  have got up <
line 35154=>the Stairs. And what were you up to? You're  supposed to  keep watch, aren't <
line 35155=>you, special orders or no? What are you for?' <
line 35156=> What are you for?' That's enough! Don't try and teach me my job. We were awake all right.  <
line 35157=>We knew there were funny things going on.' <
line 35158=>nny things going on.' funny!  ' <
line 35159=>going on.' funny!  ' : lights  and  shouting and all. But Shelob was on  the <
line 35160=>go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.' <
line 35161=>eak.'    `Her Sneak? What's that? ' <
line 35162=>t? '     `You  must  have  seen  him:  little thin  black  fellow; like a spider  <
line 35163=>himself, or perhaps more lik e a starved frog. He's  been  here  before. Came <
line 35164=>out of LugbÂ®rz the first time, years  ago,  and  we had word from High Up to <
line 35165=>let  been up the Stairs once  or twice since then, but we've <
line 35166=>im  alone: seems  to  have some  understanding with  Her  Ladyship.  I  <
line 35167=> eat:  she wouldn't  worry about words from High  Up. <
line 35168=>But a  fine guard you keep in the valley:  he  was up here a day  before all <
line 35169=>ght we  saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her  <
line 35170=>Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good  enough for me, until the <
line 35171=>  her  Sneak had  brought her a toy. or  that  you'd <
line 35172=>perhaps  sent  her a present,  a  prisoner  of  war  or  something. I  don't <
line 35173=>ing.  Nothing gets by  Shelob  when  she's on the <
line 35174=>hunt.' <
line 35175=>     'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I tell you  I'm <
line 35176=>atever came up the Stairs, did  get by. It cut her web  <
line 35177=>and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about! ' <
line 35178=>     `Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? ' <
line 35179=>     `Got him? Got who? This little fellow? But if  he was the only one then <
line 35180=>r larder long before, and there he'd be now. And <
line 35181=>if LugbÂ®rz wanted him, you'd  have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there <
line 35182=>his point Sam began to listen  more attentively and pressed his ear <
line 35183=>against theho cut the cords she'd  put round  him, Shagrat? Same one  as cut the <
line 35184=>0 And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I <
line 35185=>reckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat? ' <
line 35186=>0y. <
line 35187=>r  thinking cap on,  if you've  got one. It's no <
line 35188=>laughing matter. No  one, no one  has ever stuck a  pin in Shelob before, as <
line 35189=>you  should  know well enough.  There's no  grief in that; but think -there's <
line 35190=>0reabouts  as is more dangerous than any other  damned rebel <
line 35191=>that ever  walked since the bad old times, since the  Great Siege. Something  <
line 35192=>`And what is it then? ' growled Shagrat. <
line 35193=>is it then? ' growled Shagrat. s, Captain  Shagrat, I'd say there's  a  large warrior  <
line 35194=>loose,  Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: <
line 35195=>and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. Very funny <
line 35196=>indeed! ' Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself.  <
line 35197=>     'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy  view.'  said  Shagrat. 'You can <
line 35198=> you like, but there  may be  other   ways to explain them. <
line 35199=>Anyhow. I've  got watchers  at every point, and  I'm  going to deal with one <
line 35200=>n  I've had  a look at the fellow we have caught,  then <
line 35201=>I'll begin to worry  <
line 35202=>0bout something else.' <
line 35203=>     `It's my guess you won't find much in that little fellow,' said Gorbag. <
line 35204=>  do  with the real mischief. The big fellow with <
line 35205=>the sharp sword doesn't seem to have thought him  worth much  anyhow  -- just  <
line 35206=>h trick.' <
line 35207=> on now! We've talked enough. Let's go  and have a look <
line 35208=>at the prisoner! <
line 35209=>going to do with him? Don't forget I spotted him first. <
line 35210=>If there's any game, me and my lads must be in it.' <
line 35211=>rowled  Shagrat. 'I  have my  orders. And it's more than my <
line 35212=>belly's worth, or yours, to break 'em. Any trespasser found by the  guard is <
line 35213=>to  be held at the  tower. Prisoner is  to be stripped. Full description  of <
line 35214=>every  article, garment, weapon,  letter,  ring. or trinket is to be sent to <
line 35215=>LugbÂ®rz at once, and to  LugbÂ®rz only . And  the prisoner is to be  kept safe  <
line 35216=>and intact,  under pain  of death for every member  of  the guard, until  He <
line 35217=>0hat's plain enough,  and that's what I'm  going  to <
line 35218=>do.' <
line 35219=>     'Stripped, eh? ' said Gorbag. 'What, teeth, nails, hair, and all? ' <
line 35220=>'s for LugbÂ®rz,  I tell you. He's wanted safe and <
line 35221=>whole.' <
line 35222=>     'You'll find that difficult,' laughed Gorbag. 'He's nothing but carrion <
line 35223=>ll do with such  stuff I can't guess. He might as well go <
line 35224=>in the pot.' <
line 35225=>led Shagrat.  'You've been talking very  clever,  but <
line 35226=>there's a lot you don't  know, though most other folk do. You'll be  for the <
line 35227=>on't take  care. Carrion! Is that all you know of <
line 35228=>Her Ladyship? When she binds with cords,  she's after meat. She  doesn't eat <
line 35229=> This fellow isn't dead! ' <
line 35230=>     Sam reeled, clutching at the stone. He felt as if  the whole dark world <

line 35331=>     A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers <

line 35403=>he added seeing  the  wonder  in the  men's  faces. 'Not  he, yet one of his <
line 35404=>, and one  who  journeyed  with him,' said Pippin. 'And  Boromir of <

line 35432=>     Gandalf passed now into  the wide land  beyond the Rammas Echor. So the <

line 35441=>walled causeway, the  road came in from  the fords and bridges  of Osgiliath <
line 35442=>and passed  through a guarded gate between embattled towers. At its  nearest <
line 35443=>point the  wall was little more than one league from the  City, and that was <
line 35444=>duin, going in a  wide knee about the  hills of Emyn <

line 35459=>more from the forgotten men who  housed in  the  shadow  of the hills in the <

line 35465=>adow  in the  East;  but to his right great mountains <
line 35466=>reared their heads, ranging  from the West  to a steep and sudden end, as if <
line 35467=> the  River  had burst  through a great  barrier, <
line 35468=>carving  out a mighty valley to be a  land  of battle and debate in times to <

line 35473=>of stone  so  strong and  old that  it seemed to have been  not builded  but <
line 35474=> the bones of the earth. <
line 35475=>     Even  as Pippin gazed in wonder the walls  passed from  looming grey to <
line 35476=>in  the dawn;  and suddenly the sun climbed over the <
line 35477=>eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that  smote the face of the City. Then <
line 35478=>Tower  of  Ecthelion, standing high  within  the <
line 35479=>topmost walls' shone  out against the  sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl <
line 35480=>and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle  glittered as if  it <
line 35481=>ystals;  and white  banners  broke and  fluttered from the <
line 35482=>battlements in the morning breeze' and high and far he heard a clear ringing <
line 35483=> <
line 35484=>ode to the Great Gate  of the Men of Gondor at <
line 35485=> Gate  of the Men of Gondor at e sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them. <

line 35500=>els,  each  delved into the hill, and about each  was set a  wall, and in <

line 35502=>in the City Wall was at  the  east  point of the circuit, but the next faced <
line 35503=>0 half north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the <
line 35504=>paved  way that climbed towards  the Citadel turned  first this way and then <
line 35505=>hill. And each  time that it passed the line of <
line 35506=>the  Great Gate it went through an  arched  tunnel, piercing a  vast pier of <
line 35507=>rock whose  huge out-thrust bulk  divided in two all the circles of the City <
line 35508=> partly in  the  primeval shaping  of the hill, partly by <
line 35509=>the mighty craft and labour of old, there stood up from the rear of the wide <
line 35510=>a  towering  bastion  of stone, its edge sharp  as  a  <
line 35511=>ship-keel facing east. Up it rose, even to the level of the  topmost circle, <
line 35512=> a battlement; so that those in the Citadel might, <
line 35513=>like mariners in a mountainous ship, look  from  its peak sheer down upon the <
line 35514=>elow.  The entrance  to the Citadel also looked <
line 35515=>eastward,  but  was delved in the  heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit <
line 35516=>slope ran up to the seventh gate. Thus  men reached  at last the High Court, <

line 35518=>shapely,  fifty fathoms from its  base to the pinnacle, where the banner  of <

line 35525=>that shoulder, which rose to  the height of the fifth wall, was hedged  with <

line 35527=>in that  space stood the houses and  domed tombs of bygone kings  and lords, <
line 35528=>the mountain and the tower. <
line 35529=>     Pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and more <

line 35535=>shapes: names Pippin  guessed of great men and kindreds that had once  dwelt <
line 35536=>there;  and  yet now they were silent,  and no footsteps rang  on their wide <

line 35539=>     At last they came out of  shadow to the seventh gate,  and the warm sun <

line 35548=>the helms gleamed with a  flame of silver, for they were indeed  wrought  of <

line 35550=>embroidered in white a tree blossoming like  snow beneath a silver crown and <

line 35554=>     Already it  seemed that word of their coming had  gone before them: and <

line 35556=>strode across  the white-paved court.  A  sweet fountain played there in the <
line 35557=> of bright green  lay about it; but in the  midst. <
line 35558=>drooping over the pool,  stood  a dead  tree, and  the falling drops dripped <

line 35560=>hes back into the clear water. d at  it  as he hurried after Gandalf. It looked mournful, <
line 35561=>he thought, and he wondered why the dead tree was  left in  this place where <
line 35562=>everything else was well tended. <
line 35563=>lse was well tended.  seven stones and one white tree. <
line 35564=>     The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into  his mind. And  then <

line 35566=>and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door -wardens and entered the <
line 35567=>cows of the house of stone. <
line 35568=>     They walked  down  a paved passage, long and  empty, and  as  they went <
line 35569=> Pippin. 'Be careful of your  words, Master Peregrin!  <
line 35570=>This is  no time for  hobbit pertness. Thjoden is a kindly old man. Denethor  <
line 35571=>is of another  sort, proud and subtle,  a  man  of far  greater  lineage and <
line 35572=>power, though  he is  not called a king. But he will  speak most to you, and <
line 35573=>question you much, since you  can tell him  of his son Boromir. He loved him <
line 35574=>ch  perhaps; and the more  so because they  were  unlike. But <
line 35575=>under cover  of  this love he will think it easier to  learn what he witches <
line 35576=>fron  from me. Do not tell him more than you need, and leave <
line 35577=>  the matter of Frodo's errand. I will deal with that in due  time. And <
line 35578=>rn either, unless you must.' <
line 35579=>     'Why  not? What is wrong with Strider?' Pippin  whispered. 'He meant to <
line 35580=>come here, didn't he? And he'll be arriving soon himself anyway.' <
line 35581=>@be,' said Gandalf. 'Though if he comes, it is likely  to be <
line 35582=>in some way that no one expects, not even Denethor. It will be better so. At <
line 35583=>least he should come unheralded by us.' <
line 35584=> unheralded by us.'  halted  before a  tall  door of  polished  metal. 'See,  Master  <

line 35587=>you were  still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods  of the Shire. <

line 35589=>heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the  coming of one who  will, if <

line 35591=>     'Kingship?' said Pippin amazed. <
line 35592=>zed.      'Yes,' said  Gandalf.  'If you  have  walked all these days with closed <
line 35593=>eaep, wake up now!' He knocked on the door. <
line 35594=>up now!' He knocked on the door.   but no one could be  seen  to open it.  Pippin looked <
line 35595=>into a great hall. It was  lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at  either  <
line 35596=>f tall  pillars that upheld the  roof. Monoliths  of <
line 35597=><
line 35598=>####-black marble, they  rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of <
line 35599=> far above in  shadow  the wide  vaulting gleamed with <
line 35600=>dull  gold, inset with  flowing traceries of  many colours. No  hangings nor  <
line 35601=>0ings of woven stuff or  of wood, were to be seen in <
line 35602=>that long solemn hall; but between the pillars there stood  a silent company <
line 35603=> stone. <
line 35604=>s  reminded  of  the hewn rocks of  Argonath, and awe <
line 35605=>fell on him, as he looked down  that  avenue of kings  long dead. At the far <
line 35606=>ps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble <
line 35607=>shaped like a crowned helm; behind  it was carved upon the wall and set with <
line 35608=>wer. But the throne was empty. At the foot of <
line 35609=>rone was empty. At the foot of e lowest step which was broad and deep, there  was  a stone <
line 35610=>chair,  black and unadorned, and on it sat an  old man gazing at his lap. In <
line 35611=>his hand was a  white rod  with a  golden knob. He did not look up. Solemnly <
line 35612=>they paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces from his <
line 35613=>0poke. <
line 35614=>0ward of Minas Tirith,  Denethor son of Ecthelion! I <
line 35615=>am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.' <

line 35617=>and skin like ivory, and the long  curved nose between  the dark deep <
line 35618=>0 not so much of Boromir as of Aragor n.  'Dark <
line 35619=>our,' said  the old  man, 'and  at such times you are  wont to come, <
line 35620=>l  the  signs forebode that the  doom of Gondor is <
line 35621=>drawing  nigh, less now to me is  that darkness than my own darkness. It has <

line 35623=>o saw my son die. Is this he?' id Gandalf. 'One  of the twain. The other is with Thjoden of <

line 35626=> the omens spoke.' ling still,' said Denethor  grimly, 'and little love do  I <
line 35627=>bear the name, since those  accursed words  came to trouble our counsels and <
line 35628=>e  wild errand to his  death. My Boromir!  Now we <
line 35629=>have <
line 35630=>need of you. Faramir should have gone in his stead.' <
line 35631=>0ave  gone,' said  Gandalf.  'Be not unjust  in your  grief!  <
line 35632=>Boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. He was <
line 35633=> one  to take what he desired. I journeyed far  with him <
line 35634=><
line 35635=>####-and learned much of  his mood. But you speak of his death. You have had news <
line 35636=>e?' <
line 35637=>s,'  said Denethor, and laying  down his  rod  he <
line 35638=>lifted from his lap the  thing that  he had been gazing at.  In each hand he <
line 35639=>held up one half  of a great  horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn <
line 35640=>bound with silver. <
line 35641=>     'That is the horn that Boromir always wore!' cried Pippin. <
line 35642=>or. 'And in  my turn  I bore it, and so did each <
line 35643=>our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing <
line 35644=>of the kings, since  Vorondil father  of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw <
line 35645=> of Rhyn. I heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches <
line 35646=>thirteen  days ago, and the River brought  it to me, broken: it will wind no <
line 35647=>more.' He paused and there was a heavy silence. Suddenly he turned his black <
line 35648=>glance upon Pippin. 'What say you to that, Halfling?' <
line 35649=>@hirteen days,' faltered Pippin. 'Yes, I think that would be <
line 35650=> Yes, I stood beside him,  as he blew the  horn. But  no help  came. Only <
line 35651=>more orcs.' <
line 35652=>     'So,' said  Denethor, looking keenly at Pippin's face. 'You were there?  <
line 35653=>Tell me more! Why did no help  come? And how  did you escape, and yet he <
line 35654=>ghty a man as he wa s, and only orcs to withstand him?' <
line 35655=>     Pippin flushed and forgot his fear. 'The mightiest man may be slain  by <
line 35656=>one arrowd Boromir was pierced by  many. When last I saw him <
line 35657=>side  a tree and plucked a black -feathered shaft  from  his side. <
line 35658=>  captive. I saw him no more, and know  no <
line 35659=> saw him no more, and know  no his memory,  for he was very  valiant.  He died to save  us, my <
line 35660=>ylaid in the woods by  the  soldiery  of  the <
line 35661=>ods by  the  soldiery  of  the ough he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the less.' <
line 35662=>hen Pippin looked the old man in  the eye, for pride stirred strangely <
line 35663=>  by  the scorn  and suspicion in that  cold  voice. <
line 35664=>'Little service, no  doubt, will so great a lord of Men  think to  find in a  <
line 35665=> northern Shire; yet such as it is, I  will offer  <
line 35666=>it,  in payment  of my  debt.'  Twitching  aside his grey cloak, Pippin drew <
line 35667=> it at Denethor's feet. <
line 35668=>     A pale smile, like a gleam of  cold sun  on a winter's evening,  passed <
line 35669=>over the old man's face; but he  bent his head and held out his hand, laying <
line 35670=><
line 35671=>####-the shards of the horn aside. 'Give me the weapon!' he said. <
line 35672=>     Pippin lifted it  and presented the hilt  to him.   'Whence  came this?' <
line 35673=>any years lie on it.  Surely this is a blade wrought <
line 35674=>by our own kindred in the North in the deep past?' <

line 35687=>ap, and Pippin put his hand to d slowly after Denethor: <
line 35688=>     'Here do I swear  fealty and  service  to  Gondor, and  to the Lord and <
line 35689=>Steward of the realm, to  speak and to be silent,  to do and  to let be,  to <

line 35696=>Then Pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath. <
line 35697=>     'And now,' said  Denethor, 'my first command  to you: speak and be  not <
line 35698=>silent! Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that  you can of <
line 35699=>0and begin!' As he  spoke  he  struck a small silver  <

line 35708=> again at the end of the day.' r, it is to  be hoped,' said Gandalf. 'For I have not ridden <
line 35709=>hither from Isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind,  <
line 35710=>only to bring you one small warrior, however courteous.  Is it naught to you  <

line 35713=>     'It is much to me. But I know already  sufficient of these deeds for my <

line 35721=> greater power and the  deeper esty that  was veiled.  And he was  older, far older.  'How <
line 35722=>much older?' he wondered, and  then  he thought  how odd it was that he  had <
line 35723=>never thought about it before. Treebeard had  said  something about wizards, <
line 35724=>but even  then  he  had  not  thought of Gandalf as  one  of them. What  was <
line 35725=>0me and place did he come  into  the world, and when <
line 35726=>would he leave it? And  then his musings broke off, and he saw that Denethor  <
line 35727=>ch other in the eye, as if  reading the  other's <

line 35729=>'for though  the Stones  be lost, they say,  still the <
line 35730=>lords of Gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come <

line 35824=>to find is Faramir, now the heir of Denethor.  I do not think  that he is in <
line 35825=>the City; but I have had no  time to gather news. I must go.  Pippin. I must  <
line 35826=>council and learn what I  can. But the Enemy has the move, <
line 35827=>and he is about to open his full game.  And pawns are likely to see  as much  <
line 35828=>grin son of Paladin,  soldier  of  Gondor. Sharpen your <
line 35829=>blade!' <
line 35830=> and there he turned. 'I  am in haste Pippin,' <
line 35831=>rned. 'I  am in haste Pippin,'  a favour when you go out. Even before you rest, if you  are <
line 35832=>not too weary. Go and find Shadowfax and see how  he is housed. These <
line 35833=>s, for they are a good  and wise folk, but they have less <
line 35834=>skill with horses than some.' <
line 35835=>     With that Gandalf went out;  and as he did so, there came the note of a  <
line 35836=>g in  a tower of  the citadel. Three strokes it rang, <
line 35837=>like silver in  the  air, and ceased: the third hour from the rising of  the <
line 35838=>ippin went to  the door and  down the stair  and looked <
line 35839=>about the street. The sun was now  shining warm and bright,  and the  towers <
line 35840=>0  clear-cut shadows westward.  High in the blue air <
line 35841=>Mount Mindolluin lifted its  white helm and snowy cloak.  Armed men  went to <
line 35842=>ity, as if going at the striking of the hour to <
line 35843=>changes of post and duty. <
line 35844=>e'd call it in the Shire,' said Pippin aloud to himself.  <
line 35845=>'Just  the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring  sunshine. <
line 35846=><
line 35847=>####-And  how I  should like  breakfast! Do these  people ever  have it, or is it <
line 35848=>over? And when do they have dinner, and where?' <
line 35849=>noticed a man, clad  in  black and white, coming along the <
line 35850=>narrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. Pippin felt lonely <
line 35851=>o speak as the man passed; but he had no need. The man <
line 35852=>came straight up to him. <
line 35853=>     'You are Peregrin the Halfling?' he said. 'I am told that you have been <
line 35854=>sworn to the  service of the  Lord and of the City. Welcome! He held out his <
line 35855=>hand and Pippin took it. <
line 35856=>     'I am named Beregond son of Baranor. I have no duty this morning, and I  <
line 35857=>have been sent  to you to teach you the pass-words, and to  tell you some of <

line 35859=>would learn of you also.  For  never before have  we seen a halfling in this <

line 35862=>well?' <
line 35863=>     'Well,' said Pippin.  'I  have known of  him all my short  life, as you  <
line 35864=>nd lately  I have travelled far with him. But there  is  much to <
line 35865=>read in that book, and I cannot claim to have seen more  than a page or two.  <
line 35866=>now him as well as any but a few. Aragorn was the only one of <

line 35868=> I think, who really knew him.'  Beregond. 'Who is he?' <
line 35869=>     'Oh,' stammered  Pippin, 'he was a  man who went  about with us. I think  <

line 35874=> said Pippin, 'if I may venture to  say so, rather  a burning <

line 35876=>I mean, what  are  the  meal-times, if you  understand me, and where is  the <
line 35877=>dining-room, if there is one?  And the inns? I looked, but never a one could <

line 35882=>and of drink; though I am not a travelled man myself. Then you have not  yet <
line 35883=>, yes,  to speak in courtesy, yes,' said Pippin. 'But no more than <
line 35884=>a cup of winake or two by the kindness of your lord; but  he <
line 35885=>racked me for it with an hour of questions, and that is hungry work.' <
line 35886=>     Beregond laughed. 'At the table small men may  do the greater deeds, we <
line 35887=>0  your fast  as well as any man in the Citadel, and <
line 35888=>with  greater honour. This is a fortress and a tower  of guard and is now in <

line 35890=>and go  to our duties  at  the opening hour. But do not despair!' He laughed <
line 35891=>again,  seeing the  dismay in Pippin's  face. 'Those who have had heavy duty <

line 35893=>the  nuncheon,  at noon or  after as  duties allow; and men  gather for  the <

line 35907=>     'I am glad to learn it,' said Beregond, 'for now I may say that strange <
line 35908=>accents  do not   mar fair speech,  and hobbits are  a  fair-spoken folk. But <

line 35916=>errand-riders of  the  Lord: messengers always ready  to  go at  the  urgent <

line 35920=>'Good morning!'  said Pippin.  'Gandalf will come  as soon as  he may. He is <

line 35928=>     'None is  rich  and fair  enough for him,' said Pippin.  'He will  have <

line 35932=>     Shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and <

line 35934=>was well filled. <

line 35936=>citadel, and so  to a door in the north side of the great tower. There  they <
line 35937=>went  down a  long  cool stair into a  wide alley lit with lamps. There were <
line 35938=>he walls at the side, and one of these was open. <
line 35939=>     'This  is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the  Guard.' said <

line 35944=>     They got there bread, and butter, and cheese  and  apples:  the last of <
line 35945=>the  winter store,  wrinkled but  sound and sweet;  and a leather flagon  of <
line 35946=>and  wooden platters  and cups. They put  all into  a  wicker  <
line 35947=>basket and climbed back into the sun; and Beregond brought Pippin to a place <
line 35948=> of  the  great out-thrust battlement where  there was  an <

line 35951=>     They  ate  and drank; and they  talked now of  Gondor and its  ways and <
line 35952=>customs, now  of the Shire and the strange countries that  Pippin  had seen. <
line 35953=>And ever as they talked Beregond  was more amazed,  and looked with  greater  <
line 35954=>ging his short  legs as he sat  on the seat,  or  <

line 35978=>green fields,  and there  was much coming and going: wains moving  in  lines <
line 35979=>towards the Great Gate, and  others passing  out.  Now and again  a horseman <

line 35985=>and  fro, but all the  street seemed to be  choked with great  covered wains <

line 36004=>     'It was  a city,'  said Beregond, 'the chief city of Gondor,  of  which <
line 36005=>this  was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of Osgiliath  on either side <

line 36017=>ntains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged <
line 36018=>edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a  <
line 36019=>gain a yet deeper gloom. But  even as he looked <
line 36020=>it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly, <

line 36025=>and  darkening now; and  therefore  our fear  and disquiet grow too. And the <
line 36026=> a year ago they won back the crossings, and  many of <

line 36042=>unlike  other men: he sees far. Some  say that as he sits alone in his  high <
line 36043=>chamber  in the Tower at night, and bends his thought  this way and that, he  <
line 36044=>at of the future; and that he  will  at times search even the <

line 36076=>ers even in the lanes of the Shire - and of the winged <
line 36077=>terror,  the Nazgyl. He  shuddered, and hope seemed  to wither. And even  at <
line 36078=>second faltered and was obscured, as though a dark <
line 36079=>wing had  passed across it. Almost beyond hearing he thought he caught, high <
line 36080=>ry: faint, but heart-quelling, cruel and cold. <
line 36081=>eart-quelling, cruel and cold. cowered against the wall. <
line 36082=>'What was that?' asked Beregond. 'You also felt something?' <

line 36086=>shall fall. Night comes. The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.' <
line 36087=>     For a time they  sat together with bowed heads and did  not speak. Then <
line 36088=>suddenly Pippin looked up and  saw  that  the  sun was still shining and the <
line 36089=>banners still streaming in the breeze. He shook  himself. 'It is passed,' he <

line 36139=>it <
line 36140=>seemed that Beregond got as much honour from it as his guest, for Pippin was <
line 36141=>very welcome.  There  had  already  been  much talk  in  the  citadel  about <
line 36142=>Mithrandir's companion and his  long  closeting with the  Lord;  and  rumour <
line 36143=> of the Halflings had  come out of the North to offer  <
line 36144=>allegiance to Gondor and five  thousand  swords.  And some said that when the <
line 36145=>0han each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small <
line 36146=>maybe, but doughty. <
line 36147=>in had regretfully to destroy this  hopeful  tale,  he could <
line 36148=>not be rid of his new  rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by <
line 36149=>Boromir and honoured by  the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for  <
line 36150=>coming <
line 36151=>among them, and  hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him <
line 36152=> he could  wish. Indeed his  only  trouble was to  be <
line 36153=>'wary' according  to the counsel of Gandalf, and  not to let  his tongue wag <
line 36154=>a hobbit among friends. <
line 36155=>     At length  Beregond  rose. 'Farewell for  this time!'  he said. 'I have <
line 36156=>duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, I think. But if you  are <
line 36157=>lonely, as you  say, maybe  you would like a  merry guide about the City. My <

line 36162=>Great Gate ere the closing.' <
line 36163=>     He went out, and soon after all the  others followed. The day was st ill <
line 36164=>rowing hazy,  and it was  hot for March, even so far <
line 36165=>southwards. Pippin felt sleepy,  but  the  lodging seemed cheerless, and  he <
line 36166=>ore the City. He took a few morsels that he  had <
line 36167=>saved to Shadowfax,  and  they were  graciously accepted,  though the  horse <
line 36168=>seemed to have no lack. Then he walked on down many winding ways.  <
line 36169=>s  he  passed. To  his  face  men  were  gravely <
line 36170=>courteous, saluting him after the manner of Gondor with bowed head and hands <
line 36171=>upon the breast; but  behind him he heard many calls,  as those out of doors <
line 36172=>thin  to come  and see the Prince  of the  Halflings,  the <
line 36173=>companion of Mithrandir. Many used some other tongue than the Common <
line 36174=> before he  learned at least what was meant by  Ernil i <

line 36177=>the lowest and widest circle, a nd there  he was directed to the Lampwrights' <
line 36178=>towards  the  Great Gate. In it he found the Old <
line 36179=>Guesthouse, a large building of grey weathered stone with  two wings running <

line 36181=>between them a narrow greensward, behind which <

line 36184=>pillars,  the only children  that Pippin had  seen  in Minas Tirith,  and he <
line 36185=>stopped to look at them. Presently one of them caught sight of him, and with <
line 36186=> across  the grass and  came into the street, followed by <

line 36192=>you, and what is your name? I am ten  years a lready, and  shall soon be five <
line 36193=>r  than you. But then my father  is  a  Guard, one of  the <
line 36194=>tallest. What is your father?' <
line 36195=>     'Which question  shall  I  answer first?' said Pippin. 'My father farms <
line 36196=>well  near  Tuckborough in  the  Shire.  I  am  nearly <
line 36197=>twenty-nine, so I pass you there; though I am but four feet, and  not likely <
line 36198=>eways.' <
line 36199=>d the lad  and whistled. 'Why, you are  quite old! As <
line 36200=>old as my  uncle Iorlas. Still,' he added hopefully, 'I  wager I could stand <
line 36201=> on your back.' <
line 36202=> could, if I let you,' said Pippin with a laugh. 'And maybe I <
line 36203=>could  do  the  same  to  you: we know some  wrestling tricks in  my  little <
line 36204=>country.  Where,  let  me tell  you,  I am considered  uncommonly large  and <
line 36205=>strong; and I have never allowed anyone  to stand me  on  my  head. So if it <

line 36211=>returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye. <
line 36212=>     'No!'  Pippin laughed. 'Don't  believe what strangers say of themselves <
line 36213=> But it  would be politer in any  case for  the <
line 36214=>challenger to say who he is.' <
line 36215=>w himself  up  proudly.  'I am Bergil son of Beregond of the <
line 36216=>Guards,' he said. <

line 36218=>and he sent' <
line 36219=>y so at once?' said Bergil, and suddenly a look  <
line 36220=> over his face. 'Do not  tell me that he has changed his mind,  <
line 36221=>maidens! But no, the last wains have gone.' <
line 36222=>no, the last wains have gone.' s less bad than that, if not good.' said Pippin. 'He says <
line 36223=>that if you would  prefer it to standing me  on  my head, you might show  me <
line 36224=>round the  City for  a while  and cheer my loneliness. I can  tell  you some <
line 36225=>tales of far countries in return.' <
line 36226=>eturn.' Bergil  clapped his hands,  and laughed with relief.  'All is well,' he <
line 36227=>cried. 'Come then! We were  soon going to the  Gate  to look  on. We will go <

line 36232=>     Bergil proved a good comrade, the best company Pippin had had  since he <

line 36246=>and waited. Horns sounded at some distance, and the noise of cheering rolled <
line 36247=>towards them like a gathering wind. Then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and <
line 36248=>all about them people were shouting. <
line 36249=>ting.     'Forlong! Forlong!' Pippin  heard men calling.  'What do  they say?' he <
line 36250=>asked. <
line 36251=>     'Forlong  has come,' Bergil answered; 'old Forlong the Fat, the Lord of <

line 36262=>are they? We hoped for ten times the number. That will be the new tidings of <

line 36270=>  tall Duinhir with  his sons, Duilin and  Derufin,  and five <
line 36271=>hundred bowmen. From the  Anfalas, the Langstrand far away,  a  long line of <

line 36297=>bells in the towers tolled solemnly. Lights sprang in many windows, and from <

line 36299=>of song. <

line 36307=>and Pippin hurried back towards the citadel.  It seemed  a  <
line 36308=>long way, and he  grew hot and  very hungry; and night closed down swift and <
line 36309=>cked the sky. He  was late for the daymeal in the mess, <
line 36310=>and Beregond greeted him gladly, and sat him at his side to hear news of his <
line 36311=>0pin stayed a while,  and then took his leave, for a  <
line 36312=>strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf <
line 36313=>again. <

line 36315=>on the north side of the citadel, where  they had sat. 'It is a black night, <

line 36320=>again. Farewell and sleep in peace!' <
line 36321=>ce!'      The lodging was   dark,  save  for a  little lantern  set  on the table. <
line 36322=>Gandalf was  not there.  Gloom settled  still  more  heavily  on Pippin.  He <
line 36323=>climbed on the bench  and tried  to  peer out of a window,  but it was  like <
line 36324=>looking  into a pool of ink. He  got down and closed the shutter and went to <

line 36328=>come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. <
line 36329=>on the  table and rolls of parchment. He heard the wizard <
line 36330=>sigh, and mutter: 'When will Faramir return?' <
line 36331=>mutter: 'When will Faramir return?' pin, poking his head round the curtain. 'I thought you  <

line 36334=>     'But the night  will be too  short,' said  Gandalf.  'I have  come back  <
line 36335=>here, for I  must have a  little peace,  alone. You should sleep,  in  a bed <

line 36491=>he answered. 'They have no need to ride to war; war already marches on their <

line 36493=>0ee companions walked together, speaking of this and <

line 36495=>the mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road, until they stood  <
line 36496=>on  Helm's  Dike  and  looked into the Coomb. The Death Down  already  stood <
line 36497=>there, black and  tall and stony, and the great trampling and scoring of the <
line 36498=>s could be  plainly  seen. The Dunlendings and many men of <

line 36560=>Elrond,  that few could tell  them apart: dark-haired,  grey-eyed, and their <
line 36561=>faces elven-fair,  clad  alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver -grey. <
line 36562=> Legolas and  Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for  <

line 36564=>so startling  wa s the  change that he saw  in  him, as if in one  night many <
line 36565=>yearhis head. Grim was his face, grey-hued and weary. <

line 36569=>Thjoden, you ride now to Dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?' <
line 36570=>     'It is now a full hour past noon,' said Jomer. 'Before the night of the <
line 36571=>third day  from  now we should  come to the Hold. The Moon will then be  one <

line 36583=>faces of  the Riders  that sat within  hearing turned pale at the words. 'If <

line 36589=>     'That road  I will take, nonetheless,' said Aragorn. 'But I say to you, <

line 36600=>     'Good-bye!'  said  Merry.  He could find no more to say.  He  felt very <
line 36601=>and depressed by all these gloomy words. More than <
line 36602=>ever he  missed the  unquenchable cheerfulness  of Pippin.  The  Riders were <

line 36605=> Riders set forth. They  rode over the Dike  and down <
line 36606=>the  Coomb,  and  then,  turning swiftly  eastwards, they  took  a path that <
line 36607=>skirted  the foothills for a  mile or so, until bending south it passed back  <
line 36608=>among the hills  and disappeared from view.  Aragorn  rode  to  the Dike and <
line 36609=>were far down  the  Coomb.  Then he turned  to <
line 36610=>he  Coomb.  Then he turned  to 'There go three that I love, and the  smallest not the least,' he said. <

line 36615=>     'And now our fates are  woven together,' said Aragorn. 'And yet,  alas!  <
line 36616=>ell, I must eat a little, and  then we also must hast en <
line 36617=>away. Come, Legolas and Gimli! I must speak with you as I eat.' <
line 36618=>     Together they went back into  the  Burg; yet for some  time Aragorn sat <
line 36619=>n the  hall, and the others waited  for him to speak. <
line 36620=>'Come!'  said  Legolas  at last. 'Speak and be  comforted, and shake off the <

line 36626=>0 that accursed stone of  wizardry!' exclaimed Gimli <

line 36630=>glinted. 'Did I not openly proclaim  my  title before  the doors  of Edoras?  <
line 36631=>should say to him? Nay, Gimli,' he said  in a softer  <
line 36632=>voice,  and  the grimness left  his face, and  he looked   like  one who  has <
line 36633=>n for many nights.  'Nay, my  friends,  I  and the <
line 36634=>lawful master of the Stone, and I had both the right and the strength to use <

line 36636=>barely . ' <
line 36637=>     He drew a deep breath. 'It was  a bitter struggle, and the weariness is <
line 36638=> no word to him, and in the end I wrenched the Stone to <
line 36639=>my own  will. That alone he will find hard to endure. And he beheld me. Yes,  <
line 36640=> but in other guise than you  see  me here. If  that <
line 36641=>will aid him, then I  have  done ill. But I do not think so. To  know that I <
line 36642=>was a blow  to his heart, I deem; for he knew it <
line 36643=>not till now. The eyes in Orthanc did not see through the armour of Thjoden;  <

line 36649=>will strike more swiftly.' <
line 36650=>     'The hasty  stroke  goes oft astray,' said Aragorn. 'We must press  our <
line 36651=>Enemy, and no longer wait upon him  for the move. See my friends, when I had <
line 36652=>learned many things.  A grave peril I  saw  coming <

line 36828=>he drank, and he said:  'Farewell, Lady of Rohan! I drink to the fortunes of <

line 36853=>     The light was  still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed <

line 36867=>quail, unless it were the heart of Legolas of the Elves, for whom the ghosts <
line 36868=>of Men have no terror. <
line 36869=>     'This is an  evil door,' said Halbarad, 'and my death lies beyond it. I <

line 36872=>Aragorn.  'For if ever  we  come  through this  darkness,  many  leagues lie <
line 36873=>beyond, and every hour  that is lost there will bring the triumph  of Sauron <

line 36875=>Ælþthe way, and such was the strength of his will in that <
line 36876=>at all the DÂ®nedain and  their horses  followed him. And  indeed the <
line 36877=>0he Rangers bore for their riders was  so great that <
line 36878=>they were willing  to face even the  terror  of the Door, if  their masters' <
line 36879=>lked beside them. But Arod, the horse of Rohan, <
line 36880=>refused  the  way, and he stood sweating and trembling  in a  fear  that was <
line 36881=>grievous to see. Then Legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words <
line 36882=> the  gloom, until he  suffered himself  to  be  led, and <
line 36883=>Legolas passed in. And there stood Gimli the Dwarf left all alone. <
line 36884=>     His knees shook,  and  he  was wroth  with himself.  'Here is  a  thing <
line 36885=>d. 'An  Elf  will go underground and a  Dwarf  dare not!' <
line 36886=>With that he plunged in. But it seemed to him  that he dragged his feet like <
line 36887=>eshold; and at once a blindness  came  upon him,  even upon <
line 36888=>Gimli Gluin's son who had walked unafraid in many deep places of the world. <
line 36889=>ught  torches from Dunharrow,  and  now he went  ahead <
line 36890=>bearing one  aloft; and Elladan with  another went  at the rear, and  Gimli, <
line 36891=>o overtake him. He could  see nothing  but the dim <
line 36892=>flame  of the tor ches; but  if the company halted, there  seemed  an endless <

line 36894=>ever heard before. <
line 36895=> company  nor  withstood  their passage,  and yet <
line 36896=>steadily fear grew on the Dwarf as  he went on:  most of all because he knew <
line 36897=>now that there could be no  turning back; all the paths behind were thronged <
line 36898=>by an unseen host that followed in the dark. <
line 36899=>ed in the dark.   So time unreckoned passed, until Gimli  saw a  sight that he  was  ever <
line 36900=>call. The road was  wide, as far as he could judge, but <
line 36901=>now the company came  suddenly  into a great empty space, and there  were no <
line 36902=>longer any walls upon either side. The dread  was  so  heavy on him  that he <
line 36903=>ly walk. Away  to the  left  something glittered  in the gloom as <
line 36904=>Then Aragorn halted and  went  to look  what it  <
line 36905=>might be. <
line 36906=>     'Does  he  feel no fear?' muttered the  Dwarf. 'In any other cave Gimli <

line 36908=>here! Let it lie!' <
line 36909=> drew near,  and saw Aragorn kneeling, while Elladan held <
line 36910=>aloft both torches. Before him were the bones of  a  mighty man. He had been <
line 36911=>clad  in  mail, and still his harness lay there  whole; for the cavern's air <
line 36912=>was as dry as dust, and his  hauberk  was gilded. His belt  was  of gold and <

line 36919=>rose  and sighed. 'Hither  shall the flowers of  simbelmynl come never  unto <
line 36920=>world's  end,' he murmured. 'Nine mounds and seven there are now  green with <
line 36921=>rough all the long years he has lain at the door that  he could <
line 36922=>d? Why would he pass? None shall ever know!  <
line 36923=>e pass? None shall ever know!  not my errand!' he cried, turning back and speaking to the <
line 36924=><
line 36925=>####-whispering darkness behind. 'Keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the <
line 36926=>Accursed Years! Speed only we ask.  Let us pass, and then come! I summon <
line 36927=>o the Stone of Erech!' <
line 36928=>     There was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than <
line 36929=>the whispers  before;  and  then  a chill  blast came in  which  the torches <
line 36930=>flickered and  went  out,  and could not be  rekindled.  Of  the  time  that <
line 36931=>imli remembered little. The others pressed on, <
line 36932=>little. The others pressed on, r hindmost, pursued  by a groping horror that  seemed always <
line 36933=>just  about to seize  him; and a rumour came after him lik e the shadow-sound <
line 36934=>of many feet. He  stumbled  on until he  was  crawling  like a beast on  the <
line 36935=>ground and felt that he could endure no more: he  must either find an ending <
line 36936=>and escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear. <
line 36937=>the  tinkle of water, a sound hard and  clear  as  a  <
line 36938=>stone falling into a dream of dark shadow. Light  grew, and lo! the  company <
line 36939=>passed  through another  gateway, high-arched and broad, and a rill  ran out <
line 36940=>beside  them;  and  beyond, going  steeply  down, was  a road between  sheer <
line 36941=>cliffs, knife-edged against the sky  far above.  So deep and narrow was that <
line 36942=>0sky was  dark, and in it small stars  glinted. Yet as Gimli <
line 36943=>after learned it was still two hours ere sunset of the day on which they had <
line 36944=>set out from Dunharrow; though for all that he could then tell it might have <
line 36945=>been twilight in some later year, or in some other world. <
line 36946=>     The Company now mounted again, and Gimli returned to Legolas. They <

line 36949=>urning to speak to Gimli looked back and the Dwarf saw before <
line 36950=>his face  the glitter in the Elf's  bright  eyes. Behind them rode  Elladan, <
line 36951=>, but not the last of those that took the downward road. <
line 36952=>     'The  Dead are following,'  said Legolas. 'I  see shapes  of Men and of <
line 36953=>ers  like   shreds   of   cloud,  and   spears  like <
line 36954=>winter -thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.' <
line 36955=>     'Yes, the Dead ride behind. They have been summoned,' said Elladan. <
line 36956=>     The Company  came at last out of the ravine, as suddenly as it they had <
line 36957=> in a wall; and there  lay the uplands  of a great vale <
line 36958=>before them,  and the stream  beside them went down with a  cold  voice over <

line 36965=>southern faces of the  mountains. Its steep slopes were grass-grown; but all <
line 36966=>was grey in that  hour, for the  sun had gone, and  far below lights twinkled <
line 36967=>in the homes of Men. The vale was rich and many folk dwelt there. <
line 36968=>     Then without  turning  Aragorn  cried aloud so  that  all  could  hear: <

line 36978=>Aragorn; but the Grey  Company in their haste rode like hunters, until their <
line 36979=>horses were stumbling  with weariness. And thus, just ere midnight, and in a  <
line 36980=>0k as the caverns in the  mountains, they came at last to the <
line 36981=>Hill of Erech. <
line 36982=>terror of  the Dead lain upon that hill and upon the empty <
line 36983=>fields about it. For upon  the  top stood  a  black stone, round  as a great <
line 36984=>f a man, though its  half  was buried  in the  ground. <
line 36985=>Unearthly it looked, as though it had fallen from the sky, as some believed; <

line 36991=>thronging round  the Stone and  To tha t Stone  the Company came and halted in the  dead  of night. Then  <
line 36992=>Elrohir gave to Aragorn a silver horn, and he blew upon it and  it seemed to <
line 36993=>that stood near  that they heard a sound of answering  horns, as if it <

line 36995=> of a great host gathered  all about the hill on which they stood; <
line 36996=>eath of ghosts came down from the mountains. But <
line 36997=><
line 36998=>####-Aragorn dismounted, and standing by the Stone he cried in a great voice: <
line 36999=>     'Oathbreae come?' <
line 37000=>heard  out of the  night that answered him, as if from <
line 37001=>far away: <

line 37003=>said: 'The hour is come at last. Now I go to Pelargir upon <
line 37004=>Anduin, and ye shall come after  me. And when all this land is clean  of the <
line 37005=>servants  of Sauron, I will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace <
line 37006=>rt for ever. For I am Elessar, Isildur's heir of Gondor.' <
line 37007=>     And with that he  bade Halbarad unfurl  the great standard which he had <
line 37008=> was black, and if  there was any device upon  it, it <
line 37009=>was hidden in the darkness. Then there was silence, and  not a whisper nor a  <
line 37010=> the long  night.  The  Company camped  beside the <
line 37011=>Stone,  but  they slept little, because  of the dread  of  the Shadows  that <
line 37012=>hen the dawn came, cold and pale, Aragorn rose at once, and he led  <
line 37013=>the Companyjourney of greatest haste and  weariness that any <
line 37014=>among them  had known, save he  alone, and only his will held them to go on. <
line 37015=>ve endured it, none but the  DÂ®nedain  of the <

line 37017=>     They  passed Tarlang's Neck and came  into Lamedon; and the Shadow <
line 37018=>Host <
line 37019=>pressed behind and  fear went on  before them,  until they  came to Calembel <
line 37020=>he sun  went down like  blood behind Pinnath Gelin away in <
line 37021=>the West  behind them.  The township  and  the  fords  of  Ciril  they found <
line 37022=>n had gone away to war, and all that were left fled to  <
line 37023=>the hills at the  rumour of the coming of the King of the Dead. But the next <
line 37024=>0and the Grey Company passed on into the darkness <
line 37025=>of <
line 37026=>the Storm  of  Mordor and were lost  to  mortal sight; but the Dead followed <
line 37027=> The Muster of Rohan <
line 37028=><
line 37029=> <
line 37030=> <
line 37031=>     Now all roads were running together to  the  East to meet the coming of <
line 37032=>e Shadow. And even as Pippin  stood at the Great Gate <
line 37033=>of the City  and saw the Prince of Dol Amroth ride in with  his banners, the <
line 37034=> of the hills. <
line 37035=>ning. In  the last  rays  of the  sun  the Riders  cast long <
line 37036=>pointed shadows that went on before them. Darkness had already crept beneath <
line 37037=>ods that clothed the steep mountain-sides. The king rode <
line 37038=>now  slowly at the end  of  the day. Presently the  path turned round a huge <
line 37039=>nd plunged into the  gloom  of  soft -sighing  trees.  <
line 37040=>Down, down they went in a long winding file. When  at last they came  to the <
line 37041=> found that evening had fallen in the deep places.  <
line 37042=>The sun was gone. Twilight lay upon the waterfalls. <
line 37043=> them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass <
line 37044=>behind, cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad  walls; and now  through a  <
line 37045=>0 and passed into a wider vale. The Riders  followed <
line 37046=>it, and suddenly Harrowdale lay before  them, loud with  the noise of waters <
line 37047=>te Snowbourn, joined by the lesser stream, went <
line 37048=>rushing, fuming on  the  stones,  down to Edoras and the green hills and the <
line 37049=>plains. Away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty Starkhorn <
line 37050=>  vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but  its jagged peak, <
line 37051=>clothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the world, blue-shadowed upon <
line 37052=>y the sunset in the West. <
line 37053=>     Merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country,  of which he  had <
line 37054=>heard many tales upon their long road.  It was a skyless world, in which his <
line 37055=>eye; through dim gulfs of shadowy  air, saw only ever-mounting slopes, great <
line 37056=>at  walls, and  frowning precipices wreathed with <
line 37057=>mist.  He sat  for a moment half dreaming, listening to  the noise of water, <
line 37058=> crack of stone, and the vast waiting silence <
line 37059=>, and the vast waiting silence ind all sound. He  loved  mountains,  or he had  loved  the <
line 37060=>thought of them marching  on the edge of  stories brought from far away;  but <
line 37061=>now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of Middle-earth. He <
line 37062=>longed <
line 37063=>to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire. <
line 37064=>     He was very tired, for though they had  ridden slowly, they had  ridden <
line 37065=><
line 37066=>####-with very  little  rest. Hour after  hour for nearly three weary days he had <
line 37067=>jogged  up  and down, over passes, and through long dales,  and  across many <
line 37068=>streams. Sometimes where the way  was  broader he  had ridden at  the king's <
line 37069=>0g that many  of the Riders smiled to see  the two together: <
line 37070=>the  hobbit  on his little shaggy grey pony,  and the Lord of  Rohan on  his <
line 37071=>en he had talked to Thjoden, telling him about his home <
line 37072=>and the doings of  the Shire-folk, or listening in turn to tales of the Mark <
line 37073=>0ld.  But most of the time, especially  on this last <
line 37074=>day, Merry had ridden  by himself just behind the  king, saying nothing, and <
line 37075=> sonorous speech of Rohan that he heard the men <
line 37076=>behind him using. It was  a  language in which there seemed to be many words <
line 37077=>that he  knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the Shire, yet  <
line 37078=> the words together. At times some Rider would lift up his <
line 37079=>clear voice in stirring song,  and Merry felt his heart leap, though he  did <
line 37080=>bout. <
line 37081=>0d been lonely, and  never more so  than now at  the <
line 37082=>day's end.  He wondered where  in all this strange world  Pippin had got to; <
line 37083=>orn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly <
line 37084=>golas and Gimli. Then suddenly his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. 'I am forgetting them!' <
line 37085=>he said  to himself reproachfully. 'And yet they are more important than all <
line 37086=>the  rest of us. And I  came to help them; but now  they must be hundreds of <
line 37087=>miles away, if they are still alive.' He shivered. <
line 37088=> at  last!' said Jomer. 'Our journey  is almost at  an end.' <
line 37089=>They halted. The paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. Only a glimpse,  <
line 37090=>window, could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming <
line 37091=>below. A single small light could be seen twinkling by the river. <
line 37092=>     'This journey is over, maybe,' said Thjoden, 'but I have far yet to go. <
line 37093=> was full, and in the morning I shall ride to Edoras  to <
line 37094=>the gathering of the Mark.' <
line 37095=>     'But if you would take my  counsel,'  said  Jomer  in a low voice, 'you  <
line 37096=>until the war is over, lost or won.' <
line 37097=>the war is over, lost or won.' ,  my son, for  so I will call you, speak  not the <
line 37098=>f Wormtongue in my old ears!' He drew himself up and looked <
line 37099=>back <
line 37100=>ading into the dusk behind. 'Long years  in the <
line 37101=>t seems since I rode west;  but never  will I lean on a staff <
line 37102=><
line 37103=>####-again. If the war is lost, what good will be my hiding in the hills? And  if <
line 37104=>it is won, what grief will it be, even if I fall, spending my last strength?  <
line 37105=>night I will lie in the Hold of Dunharrow. One <
line 37106=> in the Hold of Dunharrow. One  at least is left us. Let us ride on! ' <
line 37107=>  dusk  they came  down  into  the  valley. Here  the <
line 37108=>Snowbourn flowed near  to the western walls of  the dale, and soon the  path <
line 37109=>e shallow  waters murmured  loudly on the stones. <
line 37110=>The ford was guarded.   As the king approached many men sprang up out of  the <
line 37111=>they saw the king they cried with glad voices:  <
line 37112=>'Thjoden King! Thjoden King! The King of the Mark returns!' <
line 37113=> a long call on  a horn.  It  echoed in the  valley. Other  <
line 37114=>horns answered it, and lights shone out across the river. <
line 37115=>     And suddenly  there  rose a great chorus of  trumpets from high  above, <
line 37116=> place, as  it seemed, that gathered  their  notes <
line 37117=>into one voice and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of stone. <
line 37118=>     So the  King  of  the Mark came back  victorious  out  of the  West  to <
line 37119=> feet  of  the White  Mountains. There he  found  the <
line 37120=>remaining  strength  of  his people  already assembled; for as soon  as  his <
line 37121=>ode to  meet  him at  the ford,  bearing messages <
line 37122=>from Gandalf. DÂ®nhere,  chieftain of  the  folk of Harrowdale, was at  their <
line 37123=>ys ago,  lord,' he  said. 'Shadowfax came like a wind <
line 37124=>out of  the West to  Edoras, and Gandalf brought  tidings of your victory to <
line 37125=> he  brought also  word from you  to  hasten  the <
line 37126=>gathering of the Riders. And then came the winged Shadow.' <
line 37127=>0Shadow?' said Thjoden. 'We saw it also, but that was in the <
line 37128=>dead of night before Gandalf left us.' <
line 37129=>of night before Gandalf left us.' ®nhere. 'Yet the same, or  another like to  it,  a  <
line 37130=>flying darkness in  the shape of a  monstrous bird, passed  over Edoras that <
line 37131=>morning, and all men were  shaken with fear. For it  stooped  upon Meduseld, <
line 37132=> low, almost to the gable,  there came a cry that stopped our <
line 37133=>0earts.  Then  it was that  Gandalf  counselled  us  not to  assemble in the <
line 37134=>fie you here in the valley under the mounta ins. And  he bade <
line 37135=>o kindle no more lights or fires than  barest need asked. So it has been <
line 37136=>th great authority. We trust that it is as  you  would <
line 37137=>wish. Naught has been seen in Harrowdale of these evil things.' <
line 37138=>     'It is well,' said Thjoden. 'I  will ride  now  to  the Hold, and there <
line 37139=>0t I will meet the marshals and captains. Let them come to <
line 37140=>me as soon as may be!' <
line 37141=>     The road now led eastward straight across the valley, which was at that <
line 37142=>ile in width. Flats and meads of rough grass,  <
line 37143=>ats and meads of rough grass,  falling night,  lay all about, but  in front on the far side <
line 37144=> the dale Merry saw a frowning wall, a last outlier of the great  roots of <
line 37145=>n by the river in ages past . <
line 37146=>     On all the level spaces there was great concourse of men. Some thronged <
line 37147=>to the  roadside, hailing  the king and the riders  from the West with  glad <
line 37148=>cries; but stretching away into the distance behind there  were ordered rows <
line 37149=>d lines of picketed horses,  and great store of arms, <
line 37150=>and piled spears bristling like  thickets of new-planted trees. Now  all the <
line 37151=>into shadow, and yet, though the night -chill blew <
line 37152=>cold  from  the heights  no  lanterns  glowed, no fires  were  lit. Watchmen <
line 37153=>ro. <
line 37154=>ny Riders there  were. He  could  not guess their <
line 37155=>number in the gathering gloom, but it  looked to him like a great army, many <
line 37156=>  peering from side  to side the king's party <
line 37157=>side  to side the king's party  looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley; and there <
line 37158=>suddenly the path began to climb, and Merry looked up in  amazement.  He <
line 37159=>was <
line 37160=>on a road the like of which he had never seen before,  a great work of men's <
line 37161=>hands in years beyond the  reach of  song. Upwards it wound, coiling  like a  <
line 37162=>snake, boring its way across the  sheer slope of rock.  Steep as a stair, it <
line 37163=>0ackwards and forwards as it  climbed. Up it horses  could walk, and <
line 37164=>ed; but no  enemy could come that way, except out <
line 37165=>if it was defended from above. At each turn  of the road  there <
line 37166=> had been carved in the likeness of men, huge <
line 37167=>d in the likeness of men, huge , squatting cross-legged  with  their stumpy arms folded on <
line 37168=>fat bellies. Some in the wearing of the years had lost all features save the <
line 37169=>dark  holes of  their eyes that  still stared  sadly  at the passers-by. The <
line 37170=>Riders hardly glanced at them.  The  PÂ®kel-men they  called them, and heeded <
line 37171=>them little:  no power or terror was left in them; but  Merry  gazed at them <
line 37172=>r  and a feeling almost of pity,  as they loomed up  mournfully in <
line 37173=>e he looked back and found that he had already climbed some <
line 37174=>dreds of feet  above the valley, but still far below he could dimly see a  <
line 37175=>of Riders crossing the ford and filing along the  road towards <
line 37176=>the camp prepared for  them. Only the king  and his guard were going up into <
line 37177=>th last the king's company came to a sharp brink, and the climbing road <
line 37178=>0ween walls of rock, and  so went  up a  short slope <
line 37179=>and  out  on  to a  wide  upland.  The  Firienfeld  men called it,  a  green <
line 37180=>eath, high above the deep -delved courses of the <
line 37181=>Snowbourn,  laid upon the lap of the great mountains  behind:  the Starkhorn <
line 37182=>southwards, and northwards the saw-toothed mass of  Irensaga, between  which <
line 37183=>there faced the riders, the  grim black wall  of the Dwimorberg, the Haunted <
line 37184=>tain rising out of  steep slopes of  sombre  pines. Dividing the  upland <
line 37185=>hed  a double  line of unshaped standing  stones  that <
line 37186=>dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the  trees. Those who dared to follow <
line 37187=> black Dimholt under Dwimorberg, and the menace <
line 37188=>of <
line 37189=>the pillar of stone, and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door. <
line 37190=>     Such was the dark Dunharrow, the work of long -forgotten men. Their name <
line 37191=>legend remembered it. For what purpose they had <
line 37192=>e,  as a town  or secret temple or a tomb of kings, none could say. <
line 37193=>ark Years, before ever a ship came to the western <
line 37194=>shores, or Gondor of the DÂ®nedain was built; and now  they had vanished, and <
line 37195=>left, still sitting at the turnings of the road. <
line 37196=>     Merry stared at the lines of marching stones: they were worn and black; <
line 37197=>some  were  leaning, some were  fallen,  some cracked or broken; they looked <
line 37198=>  and hungry teeth. He wondered what they could be, and he <
line 37199=>hoped  that the king was not going to follow  them into the darkness beyond.  <
line 37200=>re were  clusters of tents and booths on either side of <
line 37201=>the stony way; but these were not set near the  trees, and seemed rather  to <
line 37202=>0owards the  brink of the  cliff. The greater number  <
line 37203=>were on the right, where the Firienfeld was wider; and on the left there was <
line 37204=> of which stood a  tall pavilion. From this side <
line 37205=>a rider now came out to meet them, and they turned from the road. <
line 37206=>     As  they drew near  Merry  saw  that  the rider was a  woman  with long <
line 37207=> twilight,  yet she wore a helm and was clad to <
line 37208=>the waist like a warrior and girded with a sword. <
line 37209=>ark!'  she  cried. 'My  heart  is  glad  at your <
line 37210=><
line 37211=>####-returning.' <
line 37212=> Thjoden, 'is all well with you?' <
line 37213=>joden, 'is all well with you?' wered; yet it  seemed to  Merry  that her voice <
line 37214=>belied her,  and he would have  thought that she had  been weeping, if  that <
line 37215=>could be believed of one so stern of face. 'All is well. It was a weary road <
line 37216=> take,  torn suddenly  from their homes.  There were hard <
line 37217=>words, for it is long since war  has driven  us from  the green fields;  but <
line 37218=> deeds.  All  is now ordered, as  you  see. And  your <
line 37219=>lodging is prepared for you; for I have had full tidings of you and knew the <
line 37220=> 'So Aragorn has come then,' said Jomer. 'Is he still here?' <
line 37221=>     'No, he is gone,' said Jowyn turning away and  looking at the mountains <
line 37222=>t and South. <
line 37223=>he go?' asked Jomer. <
line 37224=>     'I  do not  know,'  she answered.  'He  came at  night,  and rode  away <

line 37226=>ved, daughter,' said Thjoden. 'What has happened? Tell me, <
line 37227=>did  he speak  of  that road?' He pointed  away along the darkening lines of <
line 37228=>morberg. 'Of the Paths of the Dead?' <
line 37229=>g. 'Of the Paths of the Dead?' yn. 'And he has passed into the shadows from which <
line 37230=>none have returned. I could not dissuade him. He is gone.' <
line 37231=>     'Then our paths are sundered,' said  Jomer. 'He is  lost.  We must ride <
line 37232=>without him, and our hope dwindles.' <
line 37233=>out him, and our hope dwindles.' ough the short heath and  upland grass, speaking <
line 37234=>no  more, until they  came to the king's pavilion.  There  Merry  found that <
line 37235=>everything  was made ready, and that he himself was not forgotten. A  little <
line 37236=>hed for  him beside the king's  lodging; and there he  sat <
line 37237=>alone,  while men passed to and fro, going in to the king and taking counsel <
line 37238=>n, and the half-seen heads of  the mountains  westward <
line 37239=>were  crowned  with  stars, but the East was dark  and  blank.  The marching <
line 37240=> sight,  but still beyond them,  blacker than  the <
line 37241=>gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the Dwimorberg. <
line 37242=>s  of the Dead,'  he muttered to himself. 'The  Paths  of the <
line 37243=>Dead? What does all this mean? They have all left me now. They have all gone <
line 37244=>alf and Pippin to  war in the East; and  Sam and Frodo to <
line 37245=>Mordor; and  Strider and  Legolas and Gimli to the Paths of the Dead. But my <
line 37246=>ough, I suppose. I  wonder what they are all  talking <
line 37247=><
line 37248=>####-about, and what the king means to do. For I must go where he goes now.' <
line 37249=>  gloomy  thoughts  he suddenly remembered that he <
line 37250=>was very hungry, and he got  up to go and see if anyone else in this strange <
line 37251=>that very moment a trumpet sounded, and  a man <
line 37252=> a trumpet sounded, and  a man im, the king's esquire, to wait at the king's board. <
line 37253=>     In the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with <
line 37254=>broidered  hangings, and strewn  with skins:  and there at a small table sat <
line 37255=>Thjoden with Jomer and Jowyn, and DÂ®nhere,  lord of  Harrowdale. Merry <

line 37262=>hobbit at the king's left hand, but no one called <
line 37263=>for any tale. There was indeed little speech, and they ate and drank for the <

line 37266=>     'Twice  now, lord, I have heard  of the  Paths of the  Dead,'  he  said. <

line 37336=>s a stranger, though as like  to Boromir as if he were <
line 37337=>one of his kin, tall and grey-eyed  and proud. He was clad as a rider with a  <

line 37414=>     'What is the matter?' he asked. <
line 37415=>asked.    'The king calls for you.' <

line 37417=>     'No, and will not rise  today,  Master Holbytla. Nor  ever  again,  one <
line 37418=>would think under this cloud. But time  does not stand still, though the Sun <
line 37419=>e!' <
line 37420=>es, Merry looked outside. The world was darkling. <
line 37421=>The very air seemed brown, and  all things  about were  black  and grey  and <
line 37422=>stillness. No shape  of cloud could be  seen, <
line 37423=>hape  of cloud could be  seen, r away  westward, where the furthest groping fingers of the <
line 37424=>great gloom  still crawled  onwards  and a little light leaked through them. <

line 37427=>wing.   Merry saw many folk standing, looking up and muttering: all their faces <
line 37428=>were grey and sad, and some  were afraid. With a sinking heart  he made  his <
line 37429=>way to the king. Hirgon the rider of Gondor  was there before him, and beside <
line 37430=>him  stood now another man, like  him and  dressed alike,  but  shorter  and <

line 37437=>     For a while the king sat silent. At last he spoke. 'So we come to it in <
line 37438=>id: 'the great battle of our time, in which many things shall <
line 37439=>0ass away. But at least there is no longer need for hiding. We will ride the <

line 37451=>ned to Merry. 'I am going  to  war,  Master Meriadoc,' he <
line 37452=>said.  'In  a  little while I shall take  the  road.  I release you from  my <
line 37453=>y friendship.  You shall abide here, and if you will, <
line 37454=>you shall serve the Lady Jowyn, who will govern the folk in my stead.' <
line 37455=>     'But, but, lord,' Merry  stammered, 'I offered you my sword.  I do  not <
line 37456=> from you like this, Thjoden King. And as all my  friends <
line 37457=>have gone to the battle' I should be ashamed to stay behind.' <
line 37458=>     'But we ride on horses tall and swift,' said Thjoden; 'and great though <
line 37459=>t ride on such beasts.' <
line 37460=>     'Then tie me on  to the back of one,  or let me hang  on a  stirrup, or  <
line 37461=>something,' said Merry. 'It  is a long way to  run; but  run  I shall, if  I <
line 37462=>cannot ride, even if I wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late.' <
line 37463=>Thjoden smiled.  'Rather  than  that  I  would  bear  you  with  me  on <
line 37464=>ut at the least you shall ride with me to  Edoras and <
line 37465=>look on Meduseld;  for that way I  shall go. So far Stybba can bear you: the <
line 37466=>ill we reach the plains.' <
line 37467=>     Then Jowyn rose  up. 'Come now,  Meriadoc!' she said. 'I will show  you  <
line 37468=><
line 37469=>####-the gear that  I have  prepared  fur  you.' They  went out  together.  'This <
line 37470=>request only did  Aragorn make to me,' said Jowyn, as  they passed among the <
line 37471=>uld be armed for battle. I have  granted it, as I could. <
line 37472=>For my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.' <
line 37473=>     Now she led Merry to a booth among the lodges of the king's  guard  and <
line 37474=>ght out to her a  small  helm, and a round shield, and <
line 37475=>other gear. <
line 37476=>t you,' said Jowyn, 'nor any time for the forging <
line 37477=>of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a  <
line 37478=>  Merry bowed,  and  the lady showed  him  the shield, which was like the <
line 37479=>shiel given  to Gimli, and  it bore on  it the device of the <
line 37480=>white horse. 'Take  all  these things,' she  said, 'and  bear  them  to good <
line 37481=>0ster  Meriadoc! Yet maybe we  shall meet again, you  <
line 37482=>and I.' <
line 37483=>     So  it was that amid a  gathering gloom the King of the Mark made ready <
line 37484=>Riders on  the eastward road. Hearts were heavy  and  many <
line 37485=>quailed  in the shadow. But they were  a stern people, loyal to  their lord, <
line 37486=>  murmuring was heard, even in  the  camp in  the Hold <
line 37487=>where the exiles from Edoras  were housed, women and children  and old  men. <
line 37488=>they faced it silently. <
line 37489=>     Two  swift hours passed, and now the king  sat  upon  his  white horse, <
line 37490=>glimmering in the half light. Proud and tall he seemed, though the hair that <
line 37491=>flowed beneath his high helm was  like  snow; and  many marvelled a t him and <
line 37492=> and unafraid. <
line 37493=>e wide  flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many <
line 37494=>companies well nigh five and fifty  hundreds of Riders fully armed, and many <
line 37495=>n  with spare  horses lightly burdened. A single trumpet <
line 37496=>sounded. The king raised his  hand, and then silently  the host  of the Mark <
line 37497=> went twelve of the king's household-men,  Riders of <
line 37498=>renown. Then the king followed with Jomer on his right. He had said farewell <
line 37499=> and the  memory was grievous; but now he turned <
line 37500=>his mind to the  road that lay ahead. Behind him Merry  rode  on Stybba with <
line 37501=>the errand riders of Gondor, and behind them again twelve more of the king's <
line 37502=>ssed  down  the long ranks of  waiting  men with stern  and <
line 37503=>unmoved faces.  But when they had  come  almost  to the end of  the line one <
line 37504=>keenly at the hobbit. A young man,  Merry thought as he <
line 37505=><
line 37506=>####-returned the glance, less in height and girth than most. He caught the glint <
line 37507=> and then he  shivered, for  it came suddenly to him that <
line 37508=>it was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death. <
line 37509=>     On  down  the grey road they went beside  the  Snowbourn rushing on its <
line 37510=>amlets of Underharrow and Upbourn, where many sad <
line 37511=>faces <
line 37512=>of women looked out from dark doors; and so without horn or harp or music of <
line 37513=>ride into the East  began with  which  the songs  of <
line 37514=>Rohan were busy for many long lives of men thereafter. <
line 37515=>harrow in the dim morning <
line 37516=>     with thane and captain rode Thengel's son: <

line 37534=>0hoofbeats afar <

line 37536=>     It was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to Edoras, although <
line 37537=>on by the  hour. There  he halted only  a short while and <
line 37538=>strengthened his host by some three  score  of Riders that  came late to the <
line 37539=>eaten he made ready to set out  again, and  he wished <
line 37540=>his esquire  a kindly farewell. But Merry begged for the last time not to be <

line 37542=><

line 37545=>f stature?' <
line 37546=>  who can tell?' answered Merry. 'But why, lord,  did you  <
line 37547=>receive me as sword-thain, if not to stay by your side? And I would not have <
line 37548=>only that I was always left behind!' <
line 37549=>hat I was always left behind!' your safe-keeping,' answered Thjoden; 'and also to <
line 37550=>do  as I might bid. None of my Riders can  bear you as burden. If the battle <
line 37551=>were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the <
line 37552=>undred leagues and two to Mundburg  where Denethor is lord. I  <
line 37553=>will say no more.' <
line 37554=>     Merry  bowed and  went  away  unhappily,  and  stared  at the lines  of <
line 37555=>horsemen. Already the companies were preparing to start: men were tightening <
line 37556=>girths, looking  to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily  at <
line 37557=>the lowering sky. Unnoticed a Rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit's <
line 37558=>ll wants not, a way opens, so we say,' he whispered; 'and so I <
line 37559=>have found myself.' Merry looked up and saw that it was the young Rider <
line 37560=>whom <
line 37561=>he had  noticed in the morning. 'You wish to go whither the Lord of the Mark <
line 37562=>goes: I see it in your face.' <
line 37563=>     'I do,' said Merry. <
line 37564=>     'Then you  shall go with me,'  said the Rider. 'I will bear  you before <
line 37565=>are far afield, and this darkness is yet darker. <
line 37566=>Such good will should not be denied. Say no more to any man, but come!' <
line 37567=>     'Thank you indeed!' said Merry. 'Thank you, sir, though I  do not  know <
line 37568=>your name.' <
line 37569=>     'Do you not?' said the Rider softly. 'Then call me Dernhelm.' <
line 37570=>     Thus it  came to pass that  when the  king set out, before Dernhelm sat <
line 37571=> the great  grey steed  Windfola  made little of the <
line 37572=>r Dernhelm  was  less in  weight than many men, though  lithe  and <

line 37583=>     And  so King Thjoden departed from his own realm, and mile  by mile the <
line 37584=>long  road  wound  away,  and  the  beacon  hills  marched  past:  Calenhad, <
line 37585=>Min-Rimmon, Erelas, Nardol. But  their fires  were  quenched. All  the lands <

line 37603=>inadequate  pat of   butter which was set out for him,  beside  a cup of thin <
line 37604=>milk.  'Why did you bring me here?' he said. <
line 37605=>me here?' he said. You know quite well,' said Gandalf. 'To keep you out  of mischief; and <
line 37606=>if you do  not  like being here, you can remember  that  you  brought it  on <
line 37607=> Pippin said no more. <
line 37608=>     Before  long  he was  walking  with  Gandalf  once  more down  the cold  <
line 37609=>he Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in a grey gloom,  <
line 37610=>like an old patient spider, Pippin  thought: he  did not seem  to have moved <
line 37611=>oned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for  <
line 37612=>a while standing unheeded. Presently the old man turned to him: <
line 37613=>     'Well, Master Peregrin,  I hope that you used yesterday to your profit, <
line 37614=>ear that the board is barer in this city than <
line 37615=>ard is barer in this city than <

line 37617=>most  of what he had said  or   known to the Lord of the City, and much was guessed of <

line 37620=>id not answer. n my service?'  sir, that you would tell me my duties.' <
line 37621=>earn what you are fit for,' said Denethor. 'But that I <
line 37622=>shall learn soonest,  maybe,  if  I  keep you beside  me. The esquire of  my <

line 37624=><

line 37626=>war and  any leisure. Can you sing?' <
line 37627=>sing?'    'Yes,' said Pippin.  'Well, yes, well enough for my  own people. But we <
line 37628=>or  great halls and evil times, lord. We seldom  sing of <
line 37629=>anything more terrible  than wind  or rain. And most  of  my songs are about <
line 37630=>h; or about food and drink, of course.' <
line 37631=>ut food and drink, of course.' ch songs be unfit for my halls, or for such  hours as <
line 37632=>these? We who have lived long under the  Shadow may surely listen to  echoes <
line 37633=>from  a land  untroubled  by  it? Then we may  feel that our  vigil was  not <
line 37634=>fruitless, though it may have been thank less.' <
line 37635=> did not  relish the idea of singing any song of <
line 37636=>the Shire to the Lord of Minas Tirith, certainly not the comic  ones that he <
line 37637=>knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an  occasion. He was however <
line 37638=> for  the present. He  was not commanded  to sing. Denethor <
line 37639=>turned to Gandalf, asking questions about  the Rohirrim and  their policies,  <
line 37640=>Jomer, the king's nephew. Pippin marvelled at the amount <
line 37641=>that the Lord seemed to  know about a people that  lived far away, though it  <
line 37642=>ny years since Denethor himself had ridden abroad. <
line 37643=>     Presently Denethor waved to Pippin and dismissed him again for a while. <
line 37644=>tadel,' he said, 'and get you there the livery <
line 37645=> 'and get you there the livery  Tower. It will be ready. It was commanded yesterday. Return <
line 37646=>when you are clad!' <
line 37647=>     It was  as he said; and Pippin soon  found himself  arrayed in  strange <
line 37648=>garments, all of black and silver. He  had a small hauberk, its rings forged <
line 37649=>of steel,  maybe,  yet black  as  jet; and a high-crowned  helm  with  small <
line 37650=>en-wings on  either  side, set with  a  silver star in the centre of  the <
line 37651=>ail was a short surcoat  of black, but broidered on the <
line 37652=>in silver with the token of the Tree. His old clothes were folded and <
line 37653=>0itted to  keep the grey cloak of Lurien, though not  <
line 37654=>to wear it  when  on duty.  He looked now, had he  known it, verily Ernil  i <
line 37655=>Pheriannath  the Halflings, that folk had  called him; but he <
line 37656=>table. And the gloom began to weigh on his spirits.  <
line 37657=>     It  was  dark and dim all day. From the sunless dawn until evening  the <
line 37658=> and all hearts in the City were oppressed.  Far <
line 37659=>above  a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the Black Land, <
line 37660=>devouring <
line 37661=>; but below the air was still and breathless,  <
line 37662=>air was still and breathless,  the Vale of Anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm. <
line 37663=>     About  the eleventh hour, released  at  last for  a while from service. <
line 37664=> went  in search  of food and  drink to cheer his heavy <
line 37665=>heart  and make his task of waiting more  supportable. In  the messes he met <
line 37666=>0just  come from an errand over the Pelennor  out to <
line 37667=>the Guard-towers upon the Causeway. Together they strolled out to the walls;  <
line 37668=>indoors, and stifled even in the  lofty citadel. <
line 37669=>Now  they sat  side by side again  in the embrasure  looking eastward, where <
line 37670=>they had eaten and talked the day before. <
line 37671=>ten and talked the day before. t-hour, but  the great pall had  now stretched far into <
line 37672=>the  West, and  only  as it sank at last into the Sea did the Sun escape  to <
line 37673=>0l  gleam before  the night, even as Frodo saw it a t <
line 37674=>the Cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king. But  to  the fields of <
line 37675=>ow of Mindolluin, there came no gleam: they were <
line 37676=>brown and drear. <
line 37677=>s to  Pippin  since he had sat  there before, in <
line 37678=>some half-forgotten time when he had still  been a hobbit,  a  light-hearted <
line 37679=>wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through. Now  he was one <
line 37680=>small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault, clad in the proud but <
line 37681=>re manner of the Tower of Guard. <
line 37682=> manner of the Tower of Guard. lace Pippin  might have been pleased with  his <
line 37683=>he knew  now  that he was taking part in no  play; he was in <
line 37684=>deadly  earnest the servant of  a grim  master  in the  greatest  peril. The <
line 37685=>me, and the helm weighed upon his head. His cloak he <
line 37686=>had <
line 37687=>cast aside  upon the seat. He turned his tired  gaze away from  the darkling <
line 37688=>, and then he sighed. <
line 37689=>     'You are weary of this day?' said Beregond. <
line 37690=>n,  'very: tired out with idleness and waiting. I have <
line 37691=>kicked my  heels  at the door of my master's  chamber  for many  slow hours, <
line 37692=>th Gandalf and the Prince and other great persons.  <
line 37693=>And I'm not  used,  Master Beregond, to waiting hungry on others while  they <
line 37694=> hobbit, that. No doubt you will think I should <
line 37695=>feel the honour more  deeply. But  what is the good  of such honour?  Indeed <
line 37696=>what is the  good even of  food  and  drink under this creeping shadow? What <
line 37697=> very air seems thick and brown! Do  you often  have such <
line 37698=>glooms when the wind is in the East?' <
line 37699=>ooms when the wind is in the East?' ond, 'this is no weather of the world. This  is some <
line 37700=>device  of his  malice; some broil of fume from the Mountain of Fire that he <
line 37701=>sends  to darken hearts and counsel. And so it doth indeed. I wish the  Lord <
line 37702=>Faramir would  return. He  would not be dismayed. But now,  who  knows if he <
line 37703=>will ever come back across the River out of the Darkness?' <
line 37704=>     'Yes,' said Pippin, 'Gandalf, too, is anxious.  He was disappointed.  I <
line 37705=>aramir here. And where has he  got to himself? He left <
line 37706=>the  Lord's council before the noon -meal,  and  in  no good  mood either,  I <
line 37707=>0ome foreboding of bad news.' <
line 37708=>     Suddenly as they talked  they were  stricken dumb, frozen as it were to <
line 37709=>listening  stones. Pippin cowered down  with his hands pressed to his  ears;  <
line 37710=>but Beregond, who  had been  looking out from the battlement  as he spoke of <
line 37711=>e, stiffened, staring  out with starting eyes. Pippin <
line 37712=>knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard <
line 37713=>of the Shire, but now it was grown  in  power and <
line 37714=>hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair . <
line 37715=>spoke with an effort. 'They have come!' he said. 'Take <
line 37716=>courage and look! There are fell things below.' <
line 37717=> climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. <
line 37718=>The Pelennor lay dim  beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of <
line 37719=>  wheeling  swiftly across  it,  like  shadows of <
line 37720=>untimely  night, he  saw in  the middle airs  below him five birdlike forms, <
line 37721=>reater than  eagles, cruel as death. Now they <
line 37722=>gles, cruel as death. Now they turing almost within bowshot of the walls, now they circled <
line 37723=>away. <
line 37724=>     'Black Riders!'  muttered Pippin.  'Black  Riders  of the air! But see, <
line 37725=>cried. 'They are  looking for something, surely? See  how they <
line 37726=>wheel and swoop,  always down to that  point over  there!  And  can  you see <
line 37727=>n the ground? Dark little things. Yes, men on horses: four <
line 37728=>or five. Ah! I cannot stand it! Gandalf! Gandalf save us!' <
line 37729=>     Another  long screech rose and fell,  and  he threw  himself back again <
line 37730=>ke  a  hunted  animal.  Faint and seemingly remote <
line 37731=>through that shuddering cry he  heard  winding  up from below the sound of a <
line 37732=>note. <
line 37733=>0 Faramir! It is  his call!' cried  Beregond. 'Brave <
line 37734=>heart! But how can he win to the  Gate, if these  foul hell-hawks have other  <
line 37735=> They hold on. They will make the Gate.  No! the <
line 37736=><
line 37737=>####-horses are running mad. Look! the men are thrown; they are running  on foot. <
line 37738=>t he  rides  back to the others. That will be  the <
line 37739=>Captain: he can master both beasts and men. Ah! there one of the foul things <
line 37740=>! Will no one go out to him? Faramir!' <
line 37741=>o one go out to him? Faramir!'  sprang  away  and ran off into the gloom. Ashamed of <
line 37742=>his terror, while Beregond of the Guard thought first of the captain whom he <
line 37743=>loved,  Pippin got up and peered out.  At that  moment he caught  a flash of <
line 37744=>white and silver coming from the  North, like a small star down on the dusky <
line 37745=> of an arrow and grew as it came,  converging  <
line 37746=> grew as it came,  converging  e flight of  the four men  towards the  Gate.  It seemed  to <
line 37747=>ppin that a  pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way <
line 37748=>as  it drew near he thought that he heard, like  an echo <
line 37749=>in the walls, a great voice calling. <
line 37750=>ing.      'Gandalf!' he  cried. 'Gandalf!  He always  turns  up  when things  are <
line 37751=>Go on,  White Rider! Gandalf, Gandalf!' he shouted wildly, <
line 37752=>like  an  onlooker  at  a  great race urging on a runner who is  far  beyond <
line 37753=>ut now  the dark  swooping shadows  were  aware  of  the newcomer. One <
line 37754=>wheeled t it seemed to Pippin that he raised  his hand,  and <
line 37755=>from  it a  shaft of  white light  stabbed upwards.  The Nazgyl  gave a long <
line 37756=>ay; and with  that the  four others wavered, and <
line 37757=>then rising in swift spirals they  passed away  eastward  vanishing into the <
line 37758=>lowering cloud  above; and down  on the Pelennor it seemed for a  while less <
line 37759=> watched,  and he  saw the  horseman and the White Rider meet and <
line 37760=>halt, waitingot. Men now hurried out to them from the  City;  <
line 37761=>and soon they all passed from sight under the  outer walls, and he knew that <
line 37762=>they were  entering the Gate. Guessing  that they would  come at once to the <
line 37763=>ard, he  hurried to the entrance of the citadel.  There he <
line 37764=>was  joined by  many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the <
line 37765=>was not long before a clamour  was heard  in the streets leading  up <
line 37766=>from the od there was much cheering and crying of  the names <
line 37767=>of Faramir  and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw torches, and followed by  a <
line 37768=>iding slowly:  one was in white but shining no <
line 37769=>ne was in white but shining no the twilight as if his  fire was spent  or veiled; the other  <
line 37770=>was dark  and his  head  was  bowed.  They  dismounted, and  as  grooms took  <
line 37771=><
line 37772=>####-Shadowfax and the  other  horse,  they walked forward to the sentinel at the <
line 37773=>gate: Gandalf  steadily,  his  grey  cloak  flung  back,  and  a fire  still <
line 37774=>is eyes; the  other,  clad all in green, slowly,  swaying  a  <
line 37775=>little as a weary or a wounded man. <
line 37776=>le as a weary or a wounded man.   as  they passed  under the  lamp  beneath  the <
line 37777=>gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath. It  <
line 37778=>was the face  of one who has been assailed by a great fear  or anguish,  but <
line 37779=>0and now is quiet. Proud and grave he stood for  a moment as <
line 37780=>he spoke to the guard, and Pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled <
line 37781=>- whom Pippin had liked from  the  first,  admiring the <
line 37782=>great man's lordly but kindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was <
line 37783=>0eling that  he had  not known before. Here was  one <
line 37784=>with  an  air of high nobility such as  Aragorn at times revealed, less high <
line 37785=>ulable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born <
line 37786=>into a  later time,  but touched with the  wisdom  and sadness of  the Elder  <
line 37787=>Race. He knew  now  why Beregond spoke his name with love. He was a  <
line 37788=>ollow, that he would follow, even under  the shadow  of the <
line 37789=>black wings. <
line 37790=>cried aloud  with the others.  'Faramir!'  And  Faramir <
line 37791=>catching his strange voice among the clamour  of the men of the City, turned  <
line 37792=>nd was amazed. <
line 37793=>me  you?'  he said. 'A halfling,  and in the  livery  of the <
line 37794=>Tower! Whence...? ' <
line 37795=>     But  with that Gandalf stepped  to his side and spoke. 'He came with me <
line 37796=>,' he said. 'He came with  me. But let us not <
line 37797=> came with  me. But let us not  is much to say and to do, and you are weary. He shall come <
line 37798=>h  us. Indeed  he  must,  for if he  does not forget his new  duties more <
line 37799=>must attend on his  lord  again within this hour. Come, <
line 37800=>Pippin, follow us!' <
line 37801=>they came to the private chamber of the Lord of the  City. <
line 37802=>There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; <
line 37803=>and there Pippin,  hardly noticed, stood behind  the  chair of Denethor  and <
line 37804=>felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. <
line 37805=>     When Faramir had  taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat <
line 37806=>r  at his father's left hand. Removed a little upon the other  <
line 37807=>side sat Gandalf in a  chair of  carven  wood; and he seemed  at first to be <
line 37808=><
line 37809=>#at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand  upon which he <
line 37810=>had been sent ore, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of <
line 37811=> Enemy and his allies; and he told of the  fight on the road <
line 37812=>when  the  men of Harad  and their  great beast were overthrown:  a  captain <
line 37813=>ster  such matters as had often been heard before, small <
line 37814=>things of  border -war that  now seemed useless  and  petty,  shorn of  their <
line 37815=>enly  Faramir looked at Pippin. 'But now  we  come  to strange  <
line 37816=>is not the first  halfling that  I  have seen <
line 37817=>t  halfling that  I  have seen rthern legends into the Southlands.' <
line 37818=>     At thp and gripped the arms of his chair;  but  he said <
line 37819=>nothing, and  with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor  <
line 37820=>looked at theodded his head, as though  in sign  that he had <
line 37821=>e before it  was spoken. Slowly, while the  others sat silent <
line 37822=>and  still,  Faramir  told  his tale, with  his  eyes  for the most part  on <
line 37823=> and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh <
line 37824=>his memory of others that he had seen. <
line 37825=> memory of others that he had seen. d of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and <
line 37826=> at Henneth  Annyn, Pippin became aware that  Gandalf's hands <
line 37827=>were  trembling as they clutched the carven wood. White they seemed now  <
line 37828=>and <
line 37829=>very old,  and as  he looked at them,  suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin <
line 37830=>knew  that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid.  The  air of <
line 37831=> still. At last when Faramir spoke of his parting with  <
line 37832=>the travellers, and of their resolve to go to Cirith Ungol,  his voice fell, <
line 37833=>and he shook his head and sighed. Then Gandalf sprang up. <
line 37834=>le?'  he said. 'The  time,  Faramir, the time?  <
line 37835=>rt with them? When would they reach that accursed valley?' <
line 37836=>     'I parted with them in  the morning two days ago,' said Faramir. 'It is <
line 37837=> to the vale  of the Morgulduin, if they went straight <
line 37838=>south; and then they would  be  still five leagu es westward of  the accursed <
line 37839=>Tower.  At  swiftest they could not come  there before today, and maybe they <
line 37840=>have not come there yet. Indeed I see what you fear. But the darkness is not <
line 37841=>due to their venture.  It began yestereve, and all Ithilien was under sha dow <
line 37842=>t is clear to me that the Enemy has long planned an assault on <
line 37843=>us, and its hour had already been determined before ever the travellers left <

line 37845=> How far is the place where you parted?' <
line 37846=>is the place where you parted?' e leagues as a  bird flies,' answered  Faramir. 'But I <
line 37847=>t  come more swiftly.  Yestereve I lay at Cair Andros, the long isle <
line 37848=>ich we hold in defence; and horses are kept on the <

line 37850=>could also be horsed. The rest of my company I  <
line 37851=>sent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of Osgiliath. I hope that <
line 37852=>I have not done ill?' He looked at his father. <
line 37853=> ill?' He looked at his father.  Denethor,  and his eyes flashed suddenly. 'Why do you ask? <
line 37854=>The men were under your command. Or do you ask for my  judgement on all <
line 37855=>your <
line 37856=>deeds? Your bearing is lowly in my presence,  yet it is long  now  since you  <
line 37857=>turned from your own way at my counsel. See, you have  spoken  skilfully, as <
line 37858=>ever; but  I, have I not seen your  eye fixed on Mithrandir, seeking whether  <
line 37859=> well or too much? He has long had your heart in his keeping. <
line 37860=>     'My son, your  father is old but not yet dotard. I can see and hear, as <
line 37861=>waslittle of what you have half said  or left unsaid  is now <
line 37862=>n from me. I know the answer to many riddles. Alas, alas for Boromir!' <
line 37863=>e  displeases you, my father,' said Faramir quietly, <
line 37864=>'I wish I had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement <
line 37865=>uld that have availed to change your judgement?' said Denethor. 'You <
line 37866=>would stil so, I deem.  I k now you well. Ever your desire is <
line 37867=>to  appear lordly and generous as  a king of old, gracious, gentle. That may <
line 37868=>if he sits in power and peace. But in desperate <
line 37869=>hours gentleness may be repaid with death.' <
line 37870=> with death.'    'So be it,' said Faramir. <
line 37871=>aid Faramir.    'So  be  it!' cried  Denethor.  'But  not  with your  death  only, Lord <
line 37872=>ath also of your father, and of all your people, whom it <
line 37873=>is your part to protect now that Boromir is gone.' <
line 37874=>then,' said Faramir, 'that our places had been exchanged?' <
line 37875=>     'Yes,  I wish that indeed,' said Denethor. 'For Boromir was loyal to me <
line 37876=> He would have remembered his father's need, and would <
line 37877=>not  have squandered what  fortune gave.  He would have brought me  a  mighty <
line 37878=>0 Faramir's restraint gave way. 'I would ask you, my father, <

line 37882=>that gave the errand to him.' <
line 37883=>     'Stir not the  bitterness in  the cup that  I mixed  for myself,'  said <
line 37884=>Denethor.  'Have I  not tasted it now  many nights upon my tongue foreboding <
line 37885=>orse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find. Would it were not so!  <
line 37886=>ad come to me!' <
line 37887=>ourself!'  said Gandalf.  'In  no  case  would  Boromir  have <
line 37888=>brought it to you. He is dead, and died well; may he sleep in peace! Yet you  <
line 37889=>deceive yourself. He would have stretched out  his hand to this  thing,  and <
line 37890=>taking it he would have fallen. He would have kept it  for his own, and when  <
line 37891=>he re not have known your son.' <
line 37892=>n.'  The face of Denethor set  hard and cold. 'You found Boromir less apt to <

line 38214=>Rammas  was broken, and all the Pelennor  abandoned  to the Enemy.  The last  <
line 38215=>word  to  come  from outside the  walls  was  brought by men flying down the <

line 38242=>devilry, none could see.  All day the labour  went forward, while the men of <
line 38243=>Minas Tirith  looked  on, unable to hinder it. And as each  length of trench <
line 38244=>was  completed,  they  could see great wains approaching; and soon yet  more <
line 38245=>companies of the enemy were swiftly setting up, each behind  the cover of  a  <
line 38246=>0ines for the casting of missiles. There were  none upon the <
line 38247=>City walls large enough to reach so far or to stay the work. <
line 38248=>     At  first  men laughed and did   not greatly fear  such devices. For the <

line 38258=>     But the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall. It was no <

line 38260=>greatest  foe. A  power and mind of malice guided  it. As soon as  the great <

line 38269=>nd the Gate  it tumbled  down,  that did not burn. But when men ran  to learn what it might  <
line 38270=>be, they cried aloud or wept.  For the enemy was flinging into  the City all <
line 38271=>the heads of  those who had  fallen fighting at Osgiliath, or on the Rammas,  <
line 38272=>or  in the fields. They were grim to look on; for though some  were  crushed <

line 38274=>could be told,  and  it  seemed that  they  had  died in pain;  and all were <

line 38281=>crying with harsh voices like beasts and  carrion-birds. But soon there were <
line 38282=>fewirith who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of <

line 38286=>his strength, so their voices, which uttered only his  will and  his malice, <
line 38287=> horror. Ever they circled  above the  City, like <
line 38288=>vultures that expect their fill of doomed men's flesh. Out of sight and shot <

line 38291=>stout-hearted would  fling  themselves to the  ground as the  hidden  menace <
line 38292=>passed  over  them,  or they would  stand, letting  their  weapons fall from <
line 38293=>nerveless hands while into their minds a blackness came, and they thought no <

line 38295=> and of crawling, and of death. k day Faramir  lay  upon his bed  in the chamber of <
line 38296=>ower, wandering  in  a  desperate fever; dying someone  said, and <
line 38297=>ying upon  the walls and in the streets. And by <
line 38298=>him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave  no  longer  any <
line 38299=>heed to the defence. <
line 38300=>     No  hours  so dark had  Pippin known, not  even in the clutches  of the <

line 38302=>ding by  the  door of the unlit  chamber, mastering  his  own <
line 38303=>fears as best he could. And as  he  watched, it seemed to him that  Denethor  <
line 38304=>s eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and <
line 38305=>his stern mind was  overthrown. Grief maybe had wrought it, and  remorse. He <

line 38308=>asked Gandalf?' <
line 38309=>     'Comfort me  not  with wizards!' said Denethor.  'The  fool's  hope has <

line 38313=>and here he lies with poison in his veins. Nay, nay, whatever may now betide <

line 38320=>the end. But that is near. Follow whom you will,  even the Grey Fool, though <
line 38321=>his hope has failed. Here I stay.' <
line 38322=>tay.'   So it was that Gandalf took command of the last defence of the City  of <
line 38323=>Gondor.  Wherever he came  men's  hearts would  lift  again,  and the winged <
line 38324=> pass from memory. Tirelessly he strode  from Citadel to  Gate,  from <
line 38325=>0wall; and with him went the Prince of Dol Amroth in <
line 38326=>his shining mail. For he and his knights still held themselves like lords in <

line 38328=>'Belike the old tales speak well; there is Elvish blood in the veins of that <

line 38330=> land once long ago.' And then id the gloom  some staves of the Lay of Nimrodel, or  other  <
line 38331=>songs of the Vale of Anduin out of vanished years.  <
line 38332=>     And  yet  - when they had  gone, the shadows closed  on  men  again, and  <
line 38333=>their hearts  went cold, and the valour of Gondor  withered into ash. And so <
line 38334=>slowly  they passed out of  a  dim  day  of  fears  into  the darkness of  a  <
line 38335=>desperate night. Fires  now raged unchecked in the first circle of the City, <
line 38336=>pon the outer wall was already in many places cut off from <

line 38342=>fire by many devious paths that had been  left between  them. On  they came, <
line 38343=>they  approached, still bunched and herded, within <
line 38344=>the  range of  bowmen on the  wall. But indeed  there were too few  now  left  <
line 38345=>there to do them great damage, though the  light of the fires showed up many <
line 38346=>a mark for archers of such skill as Gondor once had boasted. Then perceiving <
line 38347=>that the valour of the City was already beaten down, the  hidden Captain put <
line 38348=>. Slowly the great siege-towers  built in Osgiliath rolled <
line 38349=>forward through the dark. <

line 38363=>had held. 'He is burning, already burning,' he said sadly. 'The house of his <
line 38364=>spirit crumbles.' Then stepping softly towards Pippin he looked down at him. <
line 38365=>     'Farewell!' he said. 'Farewell, Peregrin  son of Paladin!  Your service <
line 38366=>has  been short,  and now  it is drawing to an end.  I release you from  the <

line 38370=>     'I will  not say  farewell, my  lord,' said  Pippin kneeling.  And then <

line 38384=>chamber. Slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be,  <
line 38385=>and Denethor, now bending on a staff, followed them; and last came Pippin.  <
line 38386=>     Out from the White Tower they walked, as if to a funeral,  out into the <
line 38387=>rhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull  <

line 38391=>they heard the  water  dripping sadly  from  the dead branches into the  dark <
line 38392=>on through the Citadel gate, where the  sentinel stared  <
line 38393=>at  them in wonder and dismay as they passed by.  Turning westward they came <

line 38413=>of tables, carved of marble;  and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands <

line 38469=>rolled. To the  north and to the  south company upon company  of  the  enemy <
line 38470=>came great beasts, like moving houses in the red  <
line 38471=>and fitful light, the mymakil  of  the Harad dragging through the lanes  amid <

line 38480=>the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest -tree a hundred <
line 38481=>feet in length,  swinging on mighty chains. Long had  it been forging in the <
line 38482=>mithies  of Mordor, and  its hideous head, founded of black steel, was <
line 38483=>of a ravening wolf; on it spells of  ruin lay. Grond <

line 38578=>Presently  he  heard  voices  speaking  low, and  he  saw  dim half-shrouded  <

line 38823=>azed, and they were quickly  slain or driven off. Before the  ruin  of <
line 38824=>ammas the king halted again. The first  jored drew up <
line 38825=>behind  him and about him on either side.  Dernhelm kept close to the  king,  <

line 38847=>His  heart  beat slowly. Time  seemed poised in  uncertainty. They  were too <
line 38848=>late! Too late was worse  than never! Perhaps Thjoden would  quail,  bow his <
line 38849=>ay to hide in the hills.  <
line 38850=>     Then suddenly Merry felt  it at  last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was <
line 38851=>glimmering. Far, far  away, in  the  South the clouds <
line 38852=>could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay <
line 38853=>hat same moment  there was a flash, as if lightning  had sprung <

line 38858=>     At that sound  the bent shape  of the king sprang suddenly  erect. Tall <
line 38859=>and  proud he seemed again; and  rising in his  stirrups he  cried in a loud <
line 38860=>than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before: <

line 38897=>turned against him; victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched <
line 38898=>out his  hand  to seize it.  But  his arm was long. He was still  in command, <

line 38912=>men were gathered about the standard of  their chieftain. <
line 38913=>And he looked  out, and in the growing light he saw the banner of  the king,  <

line 38936=>The king fell beneath him. <

line 38938=>winged  creature: if bird, then  greater than all  other  birds, and it  was <
line 38939=>naked, and neither quill nor  feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were <
line 38940=>as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank. A creature of an older  <

line 38947=>of Snowmane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck. <
line 38948=>     Upon it  sat a shape, black -mantled , huge and threatening. A  crown  of <
line 38949=> between rim and robe naught was there to see, save only a  <
line 38950=>deadly  gleam of eyes: the Lord  of the  Nazgyl. To the air he had returned, <
line 38951=> ere the darkness failed,  and now he was  come  again, <
line 38952=>bringing ruin,  turning hope to despair, and victory to death. A great black  <

line 38964=>not open his eyes or look up. <
line 38965=>     Then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard Dernhelm <

line 38975=>     'Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!' <
line 38976=>     Then  Merry heard of all sounds in that  hour the  strangest. It seemed <
line 38977=>that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the  ring of steel. 'But <
line 38978=>ok upon a  woman.  Jowyn I am, Jomund's  <

line 38981=> smite you, if you touch him.' reamed at her, but the Ringwraith made no answer, <
line 38982=>t, as if in sudden doubt. Very amazement for a moment conquered <
line 38983=>yes  and the  blackness was lifted from them. <
line 38984=>lackness was lifted from them. from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it, <

line 38987=>her  secrecy,  had fallen from  her, and her bright  hair, released from its <
line 38988=> gold upon  her shoulders. Her eyes  grey as the sea <
line 38989=>were  hard  and fell, and yet tears were  on  her cheek. A sword was in  her  <

line 39001=>intent upon the woman before him, heeded him no more than a worm in the <
line 39002=> beast beat its hideous  wings, and the  wind of them <
line 39003=>was foul.  Again it  leaped into the  air, and then  swiftly fell  down upon <

line 39005=>     Still  she  did  not blench:  maiden of  the Rohirrim, child of  kings,  <

line 39007=>skilled and deadly.  The outstretched neck she clove asunder,  and the  hewn <
line 39008=>ard she sprang  as the huge  shape  crashed to <
line 39009=>as the huge  shape  crashed to  outspread,  crumpled on the  earth; and with  its fall  the <

line 39012=>above her. Wtred that stung the very ears  like venom he let <

line 39014=>broken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent  over  her like  a cloud, and his <
line 39015=> raised his mace to kill. <
line 39016=>     But suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his <
line 39017=>stroke went  wide,  driving into the ground.  Merry's  sword had stabbed him <
line 39018=>from behind, shearing  through  the black mantle, and passing up beneath the <
line 39019=>ew behind his mighty knee. <

line 39026=>shrill wailing, passing with  the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died,  <

line 39053=>d many hours it  seemed since the king rode to his fall, though in <
line 39054=>hile. But now he saw that they were in danger of <

line 39066=>Gandalf? Is he not here? Could he not  have saved the  king and Jowyn?'  But <
line 39067=>  up  in haste, and with him  came the  knights  of  the <

line 39084=>bear his body in honour from the field, lest the battle ride over  <
line 39085=> of the king's men that lie here.' And he looked <
line 39086=>at  the  slain,  recalling their  names. Then suddenly he beheld  his sister  <
line 39087=>Jowyn as she lay, and he knew her. He stood a moment as a man who is <
line 39088=>pierced <
line 39089=>in the midst of a cry by  an arrow through the heart;  and then his face went <
line 39090=>deathly white;  and a cold  fury rose in him, so that  all speech failed him <
line 39091=>mood took him. <
line 39092=>wyn!'  he  cried at last:  'Jowyn,  how come you  here? What <
line 39093=>madness or devilry is this? Death, death, death! Death take us all!' <
line 39094=>unsel or waiting for the approach of  the men of <
line 39095=>the City, he spurred headlong back  to the front of the great host, and blew <
line 39096=>a horn, and cried  aloud for  the onset. Over the field rang his clear voice <
line 39097=>ide, ride to ruin and the world's ending!' <
line 39098=> ruin and the world's ending!' he host  began to move. But the Rohirrim sang  no  more. <
line 39099=>Death  they cried with one voice loud and terrible, and gathering speed  like <
line 39100=>a  great tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed, roaring <
line 39101=>away southwards.  <
line 39102=>Ælþoc  the hobbit stood there blinking through  his tears <
line 39103=>ne spoke to him, indeed none seemed to heed him. He brushed away <
line 39104=>k up the green shield that Jowyn had given him; and <
line 39105=><
line 39106=>####-he slung it at his back.  Then he looked for his sword that he had let fall; <
line 39107=>is blow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use <
line 39108=>his left hand. And behold! there  lay his weapon, but the blade  was smoking  <
line 39109=> been thrust in  a fire; and as  he watched it, it <
line 39110=>writhed and withered and was consumed. <
line 39111=> consumed.  So passed the sword  of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse. But glad <
line 39112=>o know its fate who wrought  it slowly long ago in the  <
line 39113=>North-kingdom when the DÂ®nedain were young,  and chief among  their foes <

line 39115=>mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound  so bitter, <
line 39116=>breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to <
line 39117=>his will. <
line 39118=>     Men now raised the  king, and laying cloaks upon  spear -truncheons they <
line 39119=>him away towards the City; and others lifted Jowyn gently <
line 39120=>up and bore her after him.  But  the  men of the king's household they could <
line 39121=>  field; for seven of the king's knights  had  fallen <
line 39122=>there, and Djorwine their chief was among them. So they laid them apart from <
line 39123=>st and set spears about them. And afterwards when <
line 39124=>all was over men returned  and  made a fire there  and burned the carcase of <

line 39132=>more  heed to  the battle.  He was weary and  full  of  pain, and  his limbs <
line 39133=> a chill. A great  rain came out of the Sea, and it seemed <
line 39134=>that all things wept for Thjoden and  Jowyn, quenching the fires in the City <
line 39135=>as through a mist that presently he saw the van of the <
line 39136=>men of Gondor  approaching. Imrahil,  Prince of Dol Amroth, rode up and <
line 39137=>What burden do you bear, Men of Rohan?' he cried. <
line 39138=>     'Thjoden King,' they answered. 'He is dead. But Jomer King now rides in  <
line 39139=>crest in the wind.' <
line 39140=><
line 39141=>####-     Then the prince went from his horse, and knelt by the bier in honour of <

line 39143=>Jowyn and  was amazed. 'Surely,  here  is a  woman?' he said. 'Have even the <
line 39144=>to war in our need?' <
line 39145=>     'Nay!  One only,'  they  answered.  'The Lady Jowyn is  she, sister  of <
line 39146=>Jomer; and we knew naught of her riding  until this hour, and greatly we rue <
line 39147=>it.' <
line 39148=>     Then the prince seeing her beauty, though her face  was pale  and cold, <
line 39149=>touched het to look more  closely on her. 'Men of Rohan!' he <
line 39150=>cried. 'Are there no leeches among you? She is hurt to the death  maybe, but <

line 39153=>it hardly to be seen. <
line 39154=>     'Haste now is needed,'  he said, and he sent one riding back swiftly to <

line 39159=>horses. Horns were blown  and trumpets  were  braying, and  the mymakil were <
line 39160=>bellowing as they  were goaded to war. Under the south walls of the City the  <
line 39161=>0 now  drove against the legions  of Morgul that were  still  <
line 39162=>gathered there in strength. But the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of <
line 39163=>all Warden of  the Keys, and the Lord of  Lossarnach, and <
line 39164=>Hirluin of the Green Hills, and Prince Imrahil the fair with his knights all <

line 39168=>Riders had passed clear through  the ranks of  the   Southrons,  discomfiting <

line 39170=>came  there the horses would not go, but  blenched and swerved away; and the <
line 39171=>unfought, and  stood  like towers of defence,  and the <
line 39172=>Haradrim rallied about them. And if the Rohirrim at  their onset were thrice <
line 39173=>im alone,  soon their case  became  worse; for new <
line 39174=>strength came  now streaming to the field  out of  Osgiliath. There they had <

line 39406=>fell  behind him in the shadows of the house; and  Denethor stepped backward <

line 39408=>     'What is this, my lord?' said the wizard. 'The houses  of the  dead are <

line 39916=> tears.  Aragorn smiled. 'It  will serve,' he said. 'The worst is  now over. <
line 39917=>Stay and be comforted!'  Then taking two leaves,  he  laid them on his hands <
line 39918=>and breathed on them,  and then  he crushed them, and straightway  a  living <

line 40696=>feint,' said Aragorn; 'and its chief purpose, I  deem, was  rather to draw us <

line 40698=>And from that evening onward the Nazgyl came and followed every move  of <

line 40702=>sun; and though the Ringwraiths did not  yet stoop low upon  their foes  and  <
line 40703=>g no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off. <
line 40704=>     So time and  the hopeless  journey wore away. Upon the fourth day  from  <
line 40705=>th from Minas Tirith they came at last to the end <
line 40706=>of  the living lands,  and began to pass into the desolation that lay before <
line 40707=> Gorgor; and  they could  descry the  marshes <

line 40709=>were those places and so  deep  the horror that lay on them that some of the <
line 40710=>host were unmanned, and they could neither walk nor ride further north. <
line 40711=>     Aragorn looked  at them,  and there was pity  in his  eyes  rather than <
line 40712=>men from Rohan,  from Westfold  far  away,  or  <
line 40713=>m  Lossarnach, and to them Mordor had been  from childhood  <
line 40714=>a <

line 40719=>there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shamed. Take your <

line 40726=>at the Cross-roads,  it was with less than six thousands <
line 40727=>that the Captains of the West came at last  to challenge the  Black Gate and <
line 40728=>   They advanced  now slowly, expecting at every hour some answer to their <
line 40729=>chaldrew together, since it was but waste of men to send out <
line 40730=>scouts or small parties from the main host. At nightfall of the fifth day of <
line 40731=>le they made their last camp, and set fires about it  <
line 40732=>of such dead wood and  heath as they  could find. They  passed the hours  of <

line 40764=>piled in years of labour. Before them towards Mordor lay like a moat a great <
line 40765=>ul-smelling  pools. When all  was  ordered, the <
line 40766=>Captains rode  forth towards the Black Gate with  a great  guard of horsemen <
line 40767=>and  the  banner and heralds  and  trumpeters.  There  was Gandalf as  chief <
line 40768=>rn  with  the sons of Elrond,  and  Jomer  of Rohan,  and <
line 40769=>Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to  go also, so that <

line 40774=>     'Come forth!'  they cried. 'Let the Lord of the Black   Land come forth!  <

line 40871=>     Looking in  the Messenger's  eyes they read his thought.  He was to  be  <
line 40872=>l that remained of the West under his sway; he <
line 40873=>of the West under his sway; he yrant and they his slaves.  <
line 40874=>  But Gandalf said:  'This is much  to demand for  the  delivery  of  one <

line 40876=>many a war to gain! Or has the field of Gondor destroyed his hope in war, so <

line 40878=>what  surety have we that Sauron the Base Master of Treachery, will keep his <
line 40879=>r?  Let him be brought forth and yielded to  us,  <
line 40880=>and then we will consider these demands.' <
line 40881=>e demands.'    It  seemed then to Gandalf,  intent, watching  him as a  man engaged in <
line 40882=>y foe, that for the taking of a breath the Messenger was <
line 40883=>at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again. <
line 40884=> loss; yet swiftly he laughed again.   your  insolence with  the Mouth of Sauron!' he <
line 40885=>cried. 'Surety you crave! Sauron gives none. If you sue for his clemency you  <
line 40886=>must first do his bidding. These are his terms. Take them or leave them!' <
line 40887=> take!' said Gandalf suddenly. He cast  aside  his cloak <
line 40888=>and a white  light shone forth like a sword in that black  place. Before his <
line 40889=>upraised hand   the  foul Messenger recoiled, and  Gandalf  coming seized and <
line 40890=>took from him  the tokens: coat,  cloak, and sword. 'These we  will take  in <
line 40891=>ried.  'But  as for your  terms, we  reject  them <
line 40892=>you gone, for your embassy is over and death is near to you. We <

line 40894=>  with Sauron,  faithless  and ess with one of his slaves. Begone!' <
line 40895=>     Then the Messenger of Mordor laughed no more. His face was twisted with <
line 40896=>d anger to the  likeness of some wild beast that, as it crouches <
line 40897=>he muzzle with a stinging rod. Rage filled him <
line 40898=> stinging rod. Rage filled him lavered, and shapeless  sounds of fury came  strangling from <
line 40899=>his throat. But he looked at the fell faces of the Captains and their deadly <
line 40900=>ame his wrath. He  gave a great cry, and  turned, leaped <
line 40901=><
line 40902=>####-upon his  steed, and with his company galloped madly back to  Cirith Gorgor. <
line 40903=>his soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged; and <
line 40904=>even before they came to the gate Sauron sprang his trap. <
line 40905=>     Drums rolled and fires leaped up.  The  great doors  of the  Black Gate <
line 40906=>it streamed a great host  as  swiftly as swirling <
line 40907=>waters when a sluice is lifted. <
line 40908=> is lifted. tains mounted  again  and rode back, and from the host of Mordor <
line 40909=>Dust  rose smothering the air,  as from nearby <
line 40910=>ering the air,  as from nearby  an army of Easterlings  that  had  waited for the signal in <
line 40911=>the shadows of Ered Lithui beyond the further Tower.  Down from the hills on <
line 40912=>either side of  the  Morannon poured Orcs innumerable. The men of  the  West  <
line 40913=>were  trapped, and soon. all about  the grey mounds where they stood, forces <
line 40914=> ten times  their  match  would ring them in a sea of <
line 40915=>enemies. Sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel. <
line 40916=>     Little  time was left to Aragorn for the ordering  of  his battle. Upon <
line 40917=> Gandalf, and there fair and desperate was raised <
line 40918=>the  ba nner of  the  Tree and  Stars.  Upon the other hill hard by stood the <

line 40920=>rse and Silver Swan. And about  made facing all ways, bristling with spear and sword. But in <
line 40921=>the front  towards Mordor  where the  first bitter  assault would come there <
line 40922=>stood the sons of Elrond on  the left with the DÂ®nedain  about them,  and on <
line 40923=>the right  the  Prince Imrahil with the men of Dol Amroth tall and fair, and <
line 40924=>r of Guard. <
line 40925=>, and the trumpets sang, and  arrows whined; but the  sun <
line 40926=>now  climbing  towards  the South was  veiled  in the reeks  of Mordor,  and <
line 40927=>through a threatening haze it  gleamed, remote, a  sullen red, as if it were <
line 40928=>0g of the day, or the  end maybe of all the world of  light. And out <
line 40929=>Nazgyl came with. their  cold voices crying words <
line 40930=>of death; and then all hope was quenched. <
line 40931=>s quenched.    Pippin had bowed crushed with horror when  he  heard Gandalf reject the  <
line 40932=>do  to the torment  of  the  Tower;  but  he had mastered  <
line 40933=>himself, and now he  stood beside Beregond in the front  rank of Gondor with <

line 40935=>story of his life, since all was in ruin. <

line 40937=>raced  through his mind, even as he watched  the enemy  come charging to the <
line 40938=><
line 40939=>####-assault. 'Well, well, now at  any rate  I understand  poor Denethor a little <
line 40940=>ight die together, Merry and  I, and since die we must, why not? <
line 40941=>pe he'll find an easier end. But now I must do <
line 40942=> easier end. But now I must do He drew  his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red <
line 40943=>and gold; and  the flowing characters of NÂ®menor glinted like fire upon  the <
line 40944=>This was made for just  such an hour,' he thought. 'If only  I could <
line 40945=>with  it, then almost I should draw level with old <
line 40946=>, I'll smite some of this beastly brood before the end. I wish I <
line 40947=>een grass again!' <
line 40948=>     Then  even  as he thought  these things the  first assault crashed into <
line 40949=>  mires that  lay before the hills halted and <
line 40950=>ay before the hills halted and ws into the defending ranks.  But through them  there  came <
line 40951=>iding  up,  roaring  like beasts, a  great company of  hill-trolls out of <
line 40952=> broader than Men they were, and they were clad only in <
line 40953=>close-fitting mesh of  horny  scales, or maybe  that was their hideous hide; <
line 40954=>0lers  huge and black and wielded heavy  hammers  in <
line 40955=>their  knotted hands.  Reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across,  <
line 40956=> a  storm they broke upon the line of the men of <
line 40957=>Gondor, and beat upon helm and head, and arm and shield as smiths hewing the <
line 40958=>hot bending iron. At Pippin's  side Beregond was stunned  and overborne, and <
line 40959=>great  troll-chief that  smote  him  down  bent over  him, <
line 40960=>reaching out  a  clutching  claw; for  these  fell creatures would bite  the <
line 40961=>they threw down. <
line 40962=>     Then  Pippin  stabbed  upwards, and  the  written blade of  Westernesse <
line 40963=>pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his <
line 40964=>black blood came gushing out. He toppled forward and came crashing down <
line 40965=>like <
line 40966=>a falling rock, burying those beneath him. Blackness and stench and crushing <
line 40967=>, and his mind fell away into a great darkness. <
line 40968=>     'So  it ends  as I  guessed  it  would,' his  thought said,  even as it <
line 40969=>fluttered away; and  it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost  gay <
line 40970=>asting off at last all doubt and care and  fear. And then <
line 40971=>even as  it  winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed <
line 40972=>rgotten world far above: <
line 40973=>     'The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!' <
line 40974=>ent more Pippin's thought hovered.  'Bilbo!'  it  said. 'But <
line 40975=><
line 40976=>####-no! That came in his tale, long long  ago. This is my  tale, and it is ended <
line 40977=>now. Good-bye!' And his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more. <

line 40985=>the deep dark outside the  under -gate of the orcs'  stronghold;  its  brazen <
line 40986=>doors were shut. He must have fallen  stunned when he hurled himself against  <
line 40987=>in there he did not know. Then he  had been on <
line 40988=>not know. Then he  had been on and furious;  now he was shivering and cold. He crept to the <
line 40989=>ors and pressed his ears against them. <
line 40990=>pressed his ears against them. uld hear  faintly the voices of ores clamouring, but <
line 40991=>soon they stopped or  passed out of hearing,  and  all was still.  His  head <
line 40992=>om lights in  the  darkness, but he struggled to <
line 40993=>steady  himself and  think. It  was clear at any rate that he had no hope of <
line 40994=>getting into the orc-hold by that gate; he might wait  there for days before <
line 40995=> he could  not wait: time  was  desperately precious. He no <
line 40996=>longer had any doubt about his duty: he must rescue  his master or perish in <
line 40997=>he  perishing is more  likely, and will be a lot  easier  anyway,' he <
line 40998=>said grim as  he sheathed Sting and turned  from  the brazen <
line 40999=>doors. Slowly  he  groped his  way back in  the dark along  the  tunnel, not <
line 41000=>ht; and as  he went he tried to fit together the <
line 41001=>events since Frodo and he  had left  the  Cross-roads. He  wondered what the <
line 41002=>time  was. Somewhere between one day and the next, he supposed;  but even of <
line 41003=>uite lost count. He  was in a  land  of darkness where the <
line 41004=>days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten <
line 41005=>f they  think of us at all,' he said, 'and what is happening <
line 41006=>to them all away there.' He  waved his  hand vaguely  in the air before him; <
line 41007=>t now facing southwards,  as  he  came back to  Shelob's <
line 41008=>tunnel, not  west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the <
line 41009=> in the  Shire-reckoning. And  even now  Aragorn was <
line 41010=>leading  the  black  fleet  from  Pelargir,  and  Merry was riding with  the <
line 41011=>ewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising <
line 41012=>and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all <
line 41013=> thoughts of  their friends  turned  constantly to <
line 41014=>Frodo and Sam. They were not forgotten. But they were far beyond aid, and no <

line 41017=>unable to  discover the catch  or bolt that held it,  he scrambled  over  as <
line 41018=> dropped softly to  the ground. Then he made his way stealthily to <
line 41019=>el, where the rags  of  her great web were still <
line 41020=>aying in the  cold airs. For cold they seemed to Sam after the  <

line 41023=>0he vast vapours that  arose in  Mordor and  went  streaming <
line 41024=>westward passed  low overhead,  a  great  welter of cloud and smoke now  lit <
line 41025=>againsullen glow of red. <
line 41026=>     Sam  looked up  towards the orc-tower, and  suddenly  from  its  narrow <
line 41027=>e small red eyes. He wondered if they were some <
line 41028=>signal.  His fear  of  the orcs,  forgot ten  for  a  while  in his wrath and <
line 41029=>desperation,  now returned. As  far  as he  could  see, there  was only  one <
line 41030=>possible course  for him to take: he  must go on  and try to find  the  main <
line 41031=>ance to  the dreadful tower; but his knees  felt weak, and he  found that <
line 41032=>wing his eyes  down from the tower and the horns of the <
line 41033=>Cleft  before  him, he forced  his unwilling  feet  to obey him, and slowly, <
line 41034=>0 ears, peering into the dense shadows of  the rocks <
line 41035=>beside the way, he  retraced his steps, past the place where Frodo fell, and <
line 41036=>ingered,  and  then  on  and up, until he stood <
line 41037=>again in the very  cleft where  he had  put  on the Ring  and seen Shagrat's <
line 41038=>company go by. <
line 41039=>0ted and sat down. For the moment he could drive himself  no <
line 41040=>further. He  felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took  <
line 41041=>  down  into the land  of  Mordor, that  step  would  be <
line 41042=>irrevocable. He could never come back. Without a ny clear purpose he drew out <
line 41043=>on again. Immediately he felt the great burden of its <
line 41044=>weight, and  felt afresh,  but  now more  strong  and urgent than ever,  the <
line 41045=>Mordor, searching, trying to pierce the shadows that it <
line 41046=>had made for its own defence, but which now  hindered it in its  unquiet and <
line 41047=>0am found  that his  hearing was sharpened, but  that to his <
line 41048=>sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky walls of the <
line 41049=>f seen through  a mist, but still at a distance he heard <
line 41050=>the bubbling of Shelob in her misery: and harsh and clear, and very close it <
line 41051=> and the clash of metal. He sprang to his  feet, and <
line 41052=>pressed himself against the wall beside  the road. He was glad of the  Ring, <
line 41053=>mpany of orcs on  the  march. Or so  at first he <
line 41054=>thought.  Then suddenly  he realized that  it  was not so,  his  hearing had <
line 41055=>deceived him: the orc-cries came from the tower, whose topmost  horn was <
line 41056=>on the left hand of the Cleft. <
line 41057=>     Sam shuddered and tried  to force  himself to  move.  There was plainly <
line 41058=>some devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all  orders  the  cruelty of  the <
line 41059=>orcs  had mastered them, and  they were tormenting Frodo,  or  even savagely <
line 41060=>s. He listened; and as he did  a gleam of hope came to  <
line 41061=>him. There could  not  be much  doubt: there was fighting in  the tower, the <
line 41062=>0g themselves, Shagrat and Gorbag had come to <
line 41063=> Shagrat and Gorbag had come to as the  hope that his  guess brought him, it  was enough to  rouse <
line 41064=>him.  There  chance. His love for Frodo rose above all other  <
line 41065=>thoughts, and forgetting his peril he cried aloud: 'I'm coming, Mr. Frodo!' <
line 41066=>     He ran  forward to  the  climbing path, and  over it.  At once the road <
line 41067=>unged steeply down. Sam had crossed into Mordor. <
line 41068=> <
line 41069=>     He took off  the  Ring, moved  it may be  by some  deep premonition  of <
line 41070=>e  thought  only that  he wished  to see  more <
line 41071=> that  he wished  to see  more  have a look at the worst,' he muttered. `No good blundering <
line 41072=>about in a fog!' <
line 41073=>uel and bitter  was the land  that met his gaze.  Before his <
line 41074=>feet the highest ridge  of the Ephel DÂ®ath fell steeply in great cliffs down <
line 41075=>into a  dark trough, on the further side  of which there rose another ridge, <
line 41076=>much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out <
line 41077=>black  against the red light  behind them: it was the grim Morgai, the inner  <
line 41078=>the fences  of  the land. Far  beyond it, but almost straight ahead, <
line 41079=> of darkness dotted  with  tiny fires, there was a great <
line 41080=>g glow; and from it rose  in huge columns a swirling smoke,  dusty red <
line 41081=>ve  where it merged into the  billowing canopy  that <
line 41082=>roofed in all the accursed land. <
line 41083=>ed land.  was looking  at Orodruin,  the Mountain of  Fire. Ever and anon the  <
line 41084=>furnaces far  below  its ashen  cone would grow hot and with a great surging <
line 41085=>and  throbbing pour  forth rivers of  molten rock from chasms  in its sides.  <
line 41086=>Some would  flow blazing towards  Barad-dyr down  great channels; some <
line 41087=>y into the  stony plain, until they cooled and lay like twisted <
line 41088=> tormented earth .  In such an hour of  labour <
line 41089=> .  In such an hour of  labour t Doom, and the light  of it, cut off by the high  screen of <
line 41090=>the Ephel DÂ®ath from those who climbed up the path from the West, now <
line 41091=>glared <
line 41092=>against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched with blood. <
line 41093=>     In that dreadful light Sam stood aghast, for now, looking to his  left, <
line 41094=>he could see the Tower of Cirith Ungol in all its strength. The horn that he <
line 41095=>n from the other side was only its topmost turret. Its  eastern face <
line 41096=>iers from a shelf in the mountain-wall far  below; <
line 41097=> to a  great  cliff behind, from which it  jutted out in pointed <
line 41098=> diminishing as they rose, with sheer sides of <
line 41099=>they rose, with sheer sides of   that looked north-east  and   south-east. About the  lowest  <
line 41100=>tier, two hundred feet below where Sam now  stood, there was a  battlemented <
line 41101=>wall  enclosing a narrow court.  Its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, <
line 41102=>opened  on a broad road,  the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a  <
line 41103=>precipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness <
line 41104=>n the road that came  over the Morgul Pass. Then on it went through a  <
line 41105=>gai  out  into the  valley of Gorgoroth  and away to <
line 41106=>  The  narrow upper way on which  Sam stood leapt  swiftly down <
line 41107=>t the main road under the frowning walls close to  <
line 41108=>the Tower -gate. <
line 41109=>ddenly Sam understood, almost  with a shock,  that <
line 41110=>this stronghold had been  built  not to  keep enemies out of  Mordor, but to <
line 41111=>e  of the works of Gondor long ago, an eastern <
line 41112=>of Gondor long ago, an eastern efences of Ithilien, made when, after the Last Alliance, Men  <
line 41113=>of  Westernesse kept  watch on  the evil land of  Sauron where his creatures <
line 41114=> But as with Narchost and Carchost, the Towers of the Teeth, so <
line 41115=>ed, and treachery had yielded up the Tower to  <
line 41116=>y had yielded up the Tower to  Ringwraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil  <
line 41117=>things. Since his return to Mordor, Sauron had found  it useful; for he  had <
line 41118=>few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief  purpose as of old <
line 41119=>was to prevent escape from Mordor. Though if an enemy were so rash as to try <
line 41120=>ecretly, then it  was also  a  last  unsleeping guard <
line 41121=>against any that might pass the vigilance of Morgul and of Shelob. <
line 41122=>     Only too clearly Sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down <
line 41123=>walls and pass the watchful gate. And  even  if he did <
line 41124=>so, he  could not go  far  on  the guarded road beyond:  not even  the black  <
line 41125=>0re  the red glow could not reach, would shield  him <
line 41126=>long from the night-eyed orcs. But desperate as that road might be, his task  <
line 41127=>void the gate and escape, but to enter it, alone. <
line 41128=> <
line 41129=>     His  thought turned to the Ring, but there was  no  comfort there, only <
line 41130=>had he come in sight of Mount Doom, burning <
line 41131=>n sight of Mount Doom, burning was aware of a cha nge in his burden. As it drew near the great <
line 41132=>of time, it had been shaped  and forged,  the <
line 41133=> been shaped  and forged,  the , and  it became more fell, untameable  save by some mighty <
line 41134=>will. As Sam stood there, even though the Ring was not on  him but hanging by <
line 41135=>neck, he felt himself enlarged, as if he were robed in a  <
line 41136=>huge distorted shadow of  himself, a vast and ominous threat halted upon the <
line 41137=>elt  that he had  from now on  only two  choices:  to <
line 41138=>forbear the Ring, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and challenge <
line 41139=>dark hold beyond the valley  of  shadows. Already <
line 41140=>the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and  reason.  Wild fantasies arose <
line 41141=> the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a <
line 41142=>ro of the Age, striding with a oss the darkened land, and armies flocking  to  his call as <
line 41143=>he  marched to the  overthrow of  Barad-dyr. And then all the  clouds rolled <
line 41144=>away,  and the white sun  shone, and  at his command the  vale of  Gorgoroth <
line 41145=>became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to <
line 41146=>0 it for his own, and all this could be. <
line 41147=>his own, and all this could be. ial it was the love of his master that helped most to <
line 41148=>0 firm; but also deep  down in him lived still unconquered his plain <
line 41149=>he core of his heart that he was not large enough <
line 41150=><
line 41151=>####-to bear such a burden, even  if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray <
line 41152=>0 of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a  <
line 41153=>garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to  use, not the hands of others to <
line 41154=>all these notions  are only a trick,' he said  to himself. <
line 41155=>'He'd spot me and cow me, before I could so much as shou t out. He'd spot me, <
line 41156=>ut the Ring  on now, in Mordor. Well, all I can say is:  <
line 41157=>things look  as hopeless  as  a frost in spring.  Just when being  invisible <

line 41159=>it's going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step. So what's to be <
line 41160=>lly  in any doubt. He knew  that he must go  down to the <
line 41161=>gate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders,  as if to shake <
line 41162=>ss  the phantoms, he began  slowly  to descend. With <
line 41163=>each  step he seemed to  diminish. He had not gone far  before he had shrunk <
line 41164=>frightened hobbit. He was now  passing under the  <
line 41165=>very walls of the Tower, and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard <
line 41166=>oment the  noise seemed to be coming from the <
line 41167=>e seemed to be coming from the outer wall. <
line 41168=>e coming from the outer wall. t half way down the path when out of the dark gateway  into <
line 41169=>the red  glow there  came two orcs running . They  did not turn towards  him. <
line 41170=>They were  making for the main road; but  even as they ran they stumbled and <
line 41171=>fell  to the ground  and lay still.  Sam had seen no  arrows, but he guessed <
line 41172=>shot down by others on  the battlements or hidden in <
line 41173=>the shadow of the gate. He  went on, hugging  the wall on his left. One look  <
line 41174=>there was no hope of  climbing it. The stone-work <
line 41175=>rose  thirty  feet, without  a crack  or ledge, to  overhanging courses like <
line 41176=>e only way. <
line 41177=>and  as he went  he wondered how many  orcs lived  in the <
line 41178=>Tower with Shagrat, and how many Gorbag had, and what they  were <
line 41179=>quarrelling <
line 41180=>hat was  happening. Shagrat's company had seemed to be <
line 41181=>about forty, and  Gorbag's more than twice as large; but of course Shagrat's <
line 41182=>art of his  garrison. Almost  certainly  they were <
line 41183=>quarrelling  about  Frodo,  and the  spoil.  For  a second  Sam  halted, for <
line 41184=>o him, almost as if he had seen them with  his <
line 41185=> if he had seen them with  his mithril coat! Of course, Frodo was wearing it, and they would find <
line 41186=>it. And from what Sam had heard Gorbag would covet it. But the orders of the <
line 41187=>ere at present Frodo's  only  protection, and if they were set <
line 41188=>aside, Frodo might be killed out of hand at any moment. <
line 41189=>     'Come on, you miserable sluggard!' Sam cried to  himself. `Now for it!' <
line 41190=>He drew Sards the  open gate. But  just as he was  about  to <
line 41191=>its great arch he felt a  shock: as if  he had run into some  web <
line 41192=>. He could see no obstacle,  but  something too <
line 41193=>strong for his will to  overcome barred  the way. He  looked about, and then  <
line 41194=>within the shadow of the gate he saw the Two Watchers. <
line 41195=>     They were like great figures seated upon thrones. Each had three joined <
line 41196=>acing outward, and inward, and across the gateway. <
line 41197=>The  heads had vulture-faces, and on  their  great knees were  laid clawlike <
line 41198=>d out of huge blocks  of stone, immovable, and <
line 41199=>ocks  of stone, immovable, and are: some dreadful  spirit of evil vigilance  abode in them. <
line 41200=>They knew  an  enemy.  Visible or  invisible none  could pass unheeded. They <
line 41201=>would forbid his entry, or his escape. <
line 41202=>ry, or his escape. ng his  will  Sam thrust forward once again, and  halted  with a  <
line 41203=>jerk, staggering  as if from a blow  upon his  breast and head. Then greatly <
line 41204=>daring, because he could  think  of nothing  else to do, answering  a sudden <
line 41205=>0hought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of Galadriel and held <
line 41206=>ight quickened swiftly, and  the shadows under  the  dark <
line 41207=>fled. The monstrous Watchers sat there cold and still, revealed  in all <
line 41208=>r a moment  Sam caught a  glitter in  the black stones  <
line 41209=>of their  eyes, the very malice of which made  him quail; but slowly he felt <
line 41210=>their wilble into fear. <
line 41211=>ast them; but even as he  did so, thrusting the  phial  back  <
line 41212=>into his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to <
line 41213=>behind  him,  that their vigilance was  renewed. And  from  those evil heads <
line 41214=> came  a high shrill cry that echoed  in the towering walls before him. <
line 41215=> answering signal,  a  harsh bell  clanged  a  single <
line 41216=>stroke. <
line 41217=> <
line 41218=>am. `Now I've rung  the front-door bell! Well, <
line 41219=>ng  the front-door bell! Well, ody!'  he  cried.  `Tell  Captain  Shagrat  that  the  great <
line 41220=>Elf-warrior has called, with his elf-sword too!' <
line 41221=>no answer. Sam  strode forward. Sting glittered  blue in his <
line 41222=><
line 41223=>####-hand. The courtyard lay in  deep shadow, but he could see that  the pavement <
line 41224=>was strewn with bodies. Right at his feet were  two  orc-archers with knives <
line 41225=>sticking  in their backs. Beyond lay many  more shapes;  some singly as they <
line 41226=>n or shot;  others in pairs, still  grappling one another, <
line 41227=>dead  in  the very  throes  of stabbing, throttling, biting. The stones were <
line 41228=>od. <
line 41229=>ed, one  marked  by the  Red  Eye, the other by a  <
line 41230=>Moon disfigured with a ghastly  face of death;  but he did not  stop to look  <
line 41231=>rt a  great door at the foot of the Tower stood <
line 41232=>half  open,  and a red light came through; a large  orc  lay dead  upon  the <
line 41233=>threshold. Sam sprang over the body and went in; and then he peered about at <
line 41234=>de  and  echoing  passage led  back  from  the  door  towards  the <
line 41235=>mountain-sidy  lit with torches flaring  in  brackets on the <
line 41236=>walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors  and openings could <
line 41237=>be seen on this  side and  that; but it was empty save for two or three more <
line 41238=>n the  floor. From what he had heard of the captains' talk  <
line 41239=>Sam knew that, dead  or alive, Frodo would most likely be found in a chamber  <
line 41240=>et far above; but he  might search for  a day  before he <
line 41241=>found the way. <
line 41242=>the back, I  guess,' Sam  muttered.  `The  whole Tower  <
line 41243=>climbs backwards-like. And anyway I'd better follow these lights.' <
line 41244=>     He advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant. <
line 41245=> to grip him again. There was no sound save the  rap of <
line 41246=>his feet, which seemed to  grow to  an echoing noise,  like  the slapping of <
line 41247=>0nes. The dead bodies: the emptiness; the dank black <
line 41248=>walls  that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the  fear of sudden <
line 41249=>shadow;  and behind all  his mind  the  waiting  <
line 41250=>watchful malice at the gate: it  was almost more than he could  screw himself <
line 41251=>d a fight-with not too many enemies at a time <
line 41252=>not too many enemies at a time s hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to  think  <
line 41253=>of Frodo,  lying bound or  in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place.  <
line 41254=>He went on. <
line 41255=>     He had passed  beyond  the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at <
line 41256=>, the inner side of  the under gate, as  he  rightly <
line 41257=>guessed,  when  there  came  from high above a dreadful  choking shriek.  He <
line 41258=> feet coming. Someone was running in great haste <
line 41259=><
line 41260=>####-down an echoing stairway overhead. <
line 41261=>y overhead.  His  will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the <
line 41262=>he Ring. But Sam did  not put  it  on; for even as  he <
line 41263=>clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark <
line 41264=>an towards him. It was no more than six paces from <
line 41265=>him  when,  lifting its head, it  saw him;  and  Sam  could hear its gasping <
line 41266=>s bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For  <
line 41267=>what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword:  <
line 41268=>it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in  a grey shadow, looming against  the <
line 41269=>ind; in one hand it held a sword, the very  light of which <
line 41270=>was a bitter pain, the other was clutched  at its breast, but held concealed <
line 41271=>f power and doom. <
line 41272=>     For a moment the orc crouched, and then with a hideous yelp  of fear it <
line 41273=>come. Never  was  any dog more heartened when <
line 41274=>s  any dog more heartened when   tail  than Sam at this unexpected flight. With a shout he <
line 41275=>e chase. <
line 41276=>rior is loose!'  he  cried. 'I'm coming. Just you show <
line 41277=>me the way up, or I'll skin you! ' <
line 41278=>you! '  But  the orc  was  in its own haunts,  nimble  and  well -fed. Sam was a  <
line 41279=> weary.  The stairs  were  high  and  steep and winding.  <
line 41280=>Sam's breath began to come in gasps. The orc had soon passed  out  of sight,  <
line 41281=> could be  heard the slapping of its feet as it went on <
line 41282=>and  up. Every now  and again it gave  a yell, and  the  echo  ran along the <
line 41283=>0nd of it died away. <
line 41284=>     Sam plodded on.  He felt that he was on the right road, and his spirits <
line 41285=>had risen a  good  deal.  He thrust  the Ring away  and tightened his  belt. <
line 41286=>he said. `If only  they all take such a  dislike to me and my <
line 41287=>0ting, this  may  turn out  better than  I hoped. And anyway it looks  as if <
line 41288=>d company  have done nearly all my job for me. Except for  <
line 41289=>that little frightened rat, I do believe  there's  nobody left alive  in the <
line 41290=>  that  he stopped, brought up  hard, as if he had hit his head <
line 41291=>l meaning of what he had said struck him like <
line 41292=>at he had said struck him like left alive!  Whose had  been that  horrible  dying  shriek? <
line 41293=>`Frodo, Frodo! Master!' he cried half sobbing. 'If they've killed you,  what <
line 41294=>shall I do? Well, I'm coming at last, right to the top, to see what I must.' <
line 41295=> <
line 41296=><
line 41297=>####-     Up, up he went. It was dark save  for an occasional torch  flaring at a  <
line 41298=>some opening  that  led into the higher levels of the Tower. <
line 41299=>Sam tried to count the  steps, but  after two hundred he lost his reckoning. <
line 41300=>ly  now: for  he thought that he could hear the sound of <
line 41301=>voices talking, still  some way above. More than  one rat remained alive, it <
line 41302=>nce, when he felt that he could pump out no more  breath, nor  <
line 41303=>force  his knees to bend again, the stair ended. He stood still. The  voices <
line 41304=> near. Sam  peered about. He had climbed right to the flat <
line 41305=>roof of the third and highest tier of the Tower: an open space, about twenty <
line 41306=>low parapet. There the  stair was covered by  a  small <
line 41307=>domed chamber in the midst of the roof, with low doors facing east and west. <
line 41308=>he plain  of Mordor vast  and  dark below, and the <
line 41309=>burning mountain  far away. A  fresh turmoil was surging in its  deep wells,  <
line 41310=> so fiercely that even at this distance of many <
line 41311=>miles the light  of them  lit the tower -top with a red glare.  Westward  the <
line 41312=>view was blocked  by the base of the great turret that stood at the  back of <
line 41313=>nd reared its  horn high above the crest of the encircling <
line 41314=>hills. Light gleamed in a window-slit. Its door was not ten yards from where <
line 41315=>n but dark, and from just within its shadow the voices <
line 41316=>came. <
line 41317=>     At first Sam did not listen; he took a pace  out  of the  eastward door  <
line 41318=>.  At  once he saw  that up  here the  fighting  had  been <
line 41319=>fiercest. All the  court was  choked with  dead orcs  or their  severed  and <
line 41320=>imbs. The place stank of death. A snarl  followed by  a <
line 41321=>blow  and  a  cry  sent him darting back into hiding. An  orc-voice rose  in <
line 41322=>0gain  at once, harsh, brutal, cold. It was  Shagrat <
line 41323=>speaking, Captain of the Tower. <
line 41324=>he Tower. won't  go again,  you say? Curse you, Snaga, you little maggot! If <
line 41325=>hat it's safe  to flout me, you're mistaken Come <
line 41326=>here, and I'll  squeeze  your  eyes out, like I did to Radbug just now.  And <
line 41327=>when some new lads come, I'll deal with you: I'll send you to Shelob.' <
line 41328=>  not before  you're dead  anyway,'  answered  Snaga  <
line 41329=>surlily. 'I've told you twice that Gorbag's swine got to the gate first, and <

line 41335=>string of foul  names and curses. `I  gave  him  better  than  I got, but he <

line 41337=>You must go, or  I'll eat you. hrough to LugbÂ®rz, or we'll both be for the Black Pits. Yes, <
line 41338=>you too. You won't escape by skulking here.' <
line 41339=>won't escape by skulking here.'  down those stairs again,' growled Snaga, `be you captain <
line 41340=>or no. Nar! Keep your hands off your knife,  or I'll  put  an arrow  in your <
line 41341=>guts. You won't be a captain  long when They hear about all these goings-on. <
line 41342=>I've  fought for the  Tower against those  stinking Morgul-rats,  but a nice <
line 41343=>ins have made of things, fighting over the swag.' <
line 41344=>     'That's enough  from you,'  snarled  Shagrat. `I had my orders. It  was <
line 41345=>nch that pretty shirt.' <
line 41346=>     `Well, you put  his back up, being so high and mighty. And he had  more <
line 41347=>0 told you more than once that the most dangerous of <
line 41348=>these spies was still loose, and you wouldn't  listen. And you  won't listen <
line 41349=>l you. There's  a great fighter  about,  one of <
line 41350=>nded  Elves, or one of the filthy tarks.1 He's coming here, I <
line 41351=>tell you. You heard the bell.  He's got past the Watchers, and that's tark's <
line 41352=>stairs. And until he's off them, I'm not going  down. Not <
line 41353=>if you were a Nazgyl, I wouldn't.' <
line 41354=>t.'     `So  that's it, is it?' yelled Shagrat. 'You'll do this, and you'll not <
line 41355=> he does come, you'll bolt  and leave me? No, you  won't! <
line 41356=>I'll put red maggot-holes in your belly first.' <
line 41357=>et-door the  smaller  orc came flying.  Behind  him came <
line 41358=>Shagrat, a large orc with long  arms that,  as  he ran crouching, reached to <
line 41359=>m hung  limp and seemed to be  bleeding;  the  other  <
line 41360=>hugged  a  large black bundle.  In the red  glare  Sam, cowering behind  the <
line 41361=>e of his evil face as it passed: it was scored as <
line 41362=>if  by  rending  claws and  smeared  with blood;  slaver  dripped  from  its <
line 41363=>rled like an animal. <
line 41364=>     As far as Sam could see, Shagrat  hunted  Snaga round  the roof,  until <
line 41365=>ducking and eluding  him the  smaller  orc with a yelp darted back  into the <
line 41366=>turret  and  disappeared. Then  Shagrat halted. Out of the eastward door Sam <
line 41367=>could see  him now  by the parapet, panting,  his  left claw  clenching  and <
line 41368=>. He put  the bundle on the floor and with  his right claw <
line 41369=>drew out a long red knife and spat on it.  Going to  the  parapet he  leaned <
line 41370=>o  the outer court far below.  Twice he shouted but no <
line 41371=><
line 41372=>####-answer came. <
line 41373=>hagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back to  the <
line 41374=>roof-top, Sam to  his amazement  saw  that one  of the  sprawling bodies was <
line 41375=>g. It  put out  a  claw and clutched the  bundle. It <
line 41376=>staggered up. In its  other hand it  held a broad-headed spear  with a short <
line 41377=>or a stabbing thrust. But at that  very moment a  <
line 41378=>hiss  escaped  its teeth, a gasp of  pain or hate. Quick as a snake  Shagrat <
line 41379=>nd drove his knife into his enemy 's throat. <
line 41380=>nife into his enemy 's throat. bag!' he cried. 'Not quite dead, eh? Well, I'll finish  my <
line 41381=>job now.' He sprang on to the  fallen  body, and stamped and trampled it  in <
line 41382=>his  fury, stooping  now and  again to  stab and  slash  it with his  knife. <
line 41383=>Satisfied  at last, he threw back  his head and let out a  horrible gurgling <
line 41384=>icked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and <
line 41385=>catching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs.  <
line 41386=> He might have slipped out of the other door, <
line 41387=>slipped out of the other door, ut  being seen;  and he could not have played hide-and-seek <
line 41388=>with this  hideous  orc for long. He did what was probably the best thing he <
line 41389=> sprang  out to  meet  Shagrat with a shout. He was  no <
line 41390=>longer holding the Ring, but it was there, a hidden power, a  cowing  menace <
line 41391=>0and in his hand was Sting, and its  light smote the <
line 41392=>eyes  of  the   orc  like  the  glitter  of  cruel  stars  in  the  terrible <
line 41393=>f which was a  cold fear to all  his  kind.  And <
line 41394=>Shagrat could not  both fight and  keep hold  of his treasure.  He  stopped, <
line 41395=>growling, baring his fangs. Then once more, orc-fashion, he leapt aside, and <
line 41396=> him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he <
line 41397=>thrust it  hard into his  enemy's face. Sam staggered, and before  he  could <
line 41398=>d past and down the stairs.  <
line 41399=>     Sam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far.  Soon the thought of <
line 41400=>Frodo returned  to him, and he remembered that the other  orc  had gone back <
line 41401=>into the turret. Here was another  dreadful  choice, and he  had  no time to <
line 41402=>t away, he would soon get help and come back. But if <
line 41403=>Sam  pursued him,  the  other orc might  do some horrible deed up there. And <
line 41404=>t or be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran <
line 41405=>back up the  stairs. `Wrong again, I expect,' he sighed. `But it's my job to <
line 41406=>go right up to the top first, whatever happens afterwards.' <
line 41407=>     Away below Shagrat went leaping  down the stairs and out over the court <
line 41408=>,  bearing his precious burden. If Sam could have  seen <
line 41409=><
line 41410=>####-him and known the grief that  his escape would bring, he might have quailed. <
line 41411=>s set on the last stage of his search. He came cautiously  <
line 41412=>to the turret-door and stepped inside. It opened into darkness. But soon his <
line 41413=>re of a dim light at  his right hand. It came  from an <
line 41414=>opening that led  to another stairway,  dark  and narrow: it appeared  to go <
line 41415=>g the inside of its round outer wall. A  torch was <
line 41416=>glimmering from somewhere up above. <
line 41417=> up above. ftly Sam began to climb. He came  to the guttering torch, fixed above <
line 41418=>0aced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the <
line 41419=>red eyes that he and Frodo  had  seen from down below by the tunnel's mouth. <
line 41420=>nd hurried on to the second storey, dreading at <
line 41421=>any  moment to he  attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize  his throat <
line 41422=>from behind. He came  next to a window looking east and another torch  above <
line 41423=>ge through the middle  of the turret. The door  was open, <
line 41424=>the passage  dark  save for the glimmer of  the torch and the red glare from <
line 41425=>gh  the window-slit.  But here  the stair stopped and <
line 41426=>climbed  no further. Sam crept into the passage.  On either side there was a  <
line 41427=> and locked. There was no sound at all. <
line 41428=>ed. There was no sound at all. tered Sam; `and after all my climb! This can't be the  <

line 41430=> of the tower. But what can I do now?'   storey and tried the door. It would not move. <
line 41431=>He ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face. He felt that even <
line 41432=>minutes were precious, but one by one they escaped; and he could do nothing. <
line 41433=>er for Shagrat or Snaga  or any  other orc that  was ever <
line 41434=>ed. He longed  only for his master,  for one  sight of his face  or one <
line 41435=>  At last, weary and feeling finally defeated, he sat on a step below the <
line 41436=>floor and bowed his head into his hands. It  was quiet, <
line 41437=>y quiet.  The torch,  that was already burning  low  when he arrived, <
line 41438=>0nd he felt the darkness cover him like a tide.  And <
line 41439=>then softly, to his own  surprise, there at the vain end of his long journey <
line 41440=>and his  grie thought in his  heart he could  not  tell, Sam <
line 41441=><
line 41442=>  quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice <
line 41443=>the cold dark tower: the voice  weary hobbit  that no listening orc could possibly mistake <
line 41444=>for the  clear song of an Elven-lord. He murmured  old childish tunes out of <
line 41445=>es of Mr.  Bilbo's  rhymes that came into his mind like <
line 41446=><
line 41447=>####-fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. And then suddenly new strength <
line 41448=>s voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to <
line 41449=>fit the simple tune. <
line 41450=> lands beneath the Sun  <

line 41467=>stoppeght that he had heard a faint voice answering him. But <
line 41468=>now he could  hear nothing. Yes, he  could hear something,  but not a voice.  <
line 41469=>0ng.  Now  a  door was being opened  quietly in  the <
line 41470=>passage above; the hinges  creaked. Sam crouched  down  listening.  The door  <
line 41471=> then a snarling orc-voice rang out. <
line 41472=>a snarling orc-voice rang out. , you dunghill rat! Stop your  squeaking,  or I'll <

line 41474=>you hear?' here was no answer. <
line 41475=>     'All right,' growled Snaga.  `But I'll come and  have a look at you all <

line 41477=>and see what you're up to.' d again, and Sam, now  peering over  the corner of the <
line 41478=>passage-threshold, saw a flicker  of light in an open doorway, and  the  dim <
line 41479=>t. He seemed to be carrying a ladder. Suddenly the <
line 41480=>answer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber was reached  by a trap-door in <
line 41481=>the <
line 41482=>rust the ladder  upwards, steadied it, and then <
line 41483=>  out  of  sight. Sam heard  a bolt drawn back.  Then he  heard the <
line 41484=>n. <
line 41485=>u'll pay for it! You've not got long to live  in <
line 41486=>peace, I guess; but if you don't want the fun to begin right now, keep  your <
line 41487=>trap shut, see? There's a reminder  for you!'  There was  a sound  like  the <
line 41488=>     At that rage blazed in Sam's heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up, ran, <
line 41489=>anadder  like a cat. His head came out in the middle of  the <
line 41490=>floor of a large  round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof; the westward <
line 41491=>nd dark. Something  was lying on the floor by the wall <
line 41492=>under the window,  but over it a black  orc-shape was straddled. It raised a  <
line 41493=>0he blow never fell. <
line 41494=>     With a cry Sam  leapt across  the floor, Sting in hand. The orc wheeled <
line 41495=>round, but before it could make a move Sam slashed  its  whip-hand  from its <
line 41496=>ith pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down  at <
line 41497=>0im.  Sam's  next  blow  went wide,  and  thrown  off  his balance  he  fell <
line 41498=>g at  the  orc as it  stumbled over him.  Before he could <
line 41499=>scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The orc in its wild haste had tripped <
line 41500=>d  fallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more <
line 41501=>thought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo. <
line 41502=>if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his arm <
line 41503=>was  flung up,  shielding his head,  and  across his side there ran an  ugly <
line 41504=>whip-weal. <
line 41505=>o,  my dear!'  cried Sam,  tears  almost  blinding him. <
line 41506=>`It's Sam, I've come!' He  half  lifted  his  master and hugged  him to  his <
line 41507=>0eyes. <
line 41508=>0ing?'  he  muttered.  `But  the other  dreams  were <

line 41511=>id  Sam. `It's real. It's  me.  `I can hardly believe it,' said Frodo, clutching him. `There was an orc <
line 41512=>Ålþ it  turns into Sam! Then I wasn't  dreaming after all <
line 41513=>when I heard that singing down below, and I tried to answer? Was it you?' <
line 41514=>     'It was indeed, Mr.  Frodo. I'd given up  hope, almost. I couldn't find <

line 41519=> was not  enough for him to find his master, he  had still to <
line 41520=>try and save him. He kissed Frodo's forehead. `Come!  Wake up Mr. Frodo!' he <
line 41521=>nd as cheerful  as he had when  he drew back the curtains <
line 41522=>at Bag End on a summer's morning. <
line 41523=>ng.    Frodo sighed and sat up. `Where are we? How did I get here?' he asked. <
line 41524=> for tales till we get somewhere else, Mr. Frodo,' said <
line 41525=>Sam. `But you're in the top of that tower you and me saw from away  down  by <
line 41526=>0s got you. How long ago that wa s I don't know. More <
line 41527=>than a day, I guess.' <
line 41528=>aid  Frodo. `It seems weeks. You  must  tell me all about <
line 41529=>it,  if  we get  a  chance. Something  hit me, didn't  it?  And I fell  into <
line 41530=>darkness and foul dreams,  and  woke and found that  waking was worse.  Orcs <
line 41531=>were all round me. I think they had just been  pouring some horrible burning  <
line 41532=>head grew clear, but I was  aching and weary. They <
line 41533=>stripped me of everything; and then two great brutes came and questioned me, <
line 41534=> I should go mad, standing  over me, gloating,  <
line 41535=>fingering their knives. I'll never forget their claws and eyes.' <
line 41536=>     `You won't,  if you talk about them, Mr.  Frodo,' said Sam.  'And if we <
line 41537=>the sooner we   get going  the better. Can you  <
line 41538=>walk?' <
line 41539=>     `Yes,  I can walk,' said Frodo, getting up slowly. 'I am not hurt  Sam. <
line 41540=>0and I've a pain here.' He put  his hand to the back  <
line 41541=>of his neck above his left shoulder. He stood up, and it looked to Sam as if <
line 41542=> naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp <
line 41543=>above. Twice he paced across the floor. <
line 41544=>s the floor. `That's better!' he said,  his spirits rising a  little. `I didn't dare <
line 41545=> alone, or  one of the guards came. Until the yelling <
line 41546=>and fighting began. The two big  brutes:  they quarrelled, I think. Over  me <
line 41547=>  terrified. And then all  went deadly quiet, and <
line 41548=>that was worse.' <
line 41549=>, seemingly,'  said Sam. (There must  have been a  <
line 41550=>couple  of  hundred of the dirty creatures  in  this place.  A bit of a tall <
line 41551=>order for Sam Gamgee, as  you might say. But they've done all the killing of <
line 41552=>themselves. That's lucky, but it's too long to make a song about, till we're <

line 41557=>understand?  Everything!'  He cowered on the floor again with bowed head, as <
line 41558=>his own words brought home to  him the fullness of the disaster, and despair  <
line 41559=>  has failed Sam. Even if we get out of here, we <
line 41560=>can't escape. Only  Elves  can escape. Away,  away out  of Middle-earth, far  <
line 41561=> is wide enough to keep the Shadow out.' <
line 41562=>nough to keep the Shadow out.' ing, Mr. Frodo. And it  hasn't failed, not yet. I took  <
line 41563=>it, Mr. Frodo, begging your pardon.  And I've kept  it safe.  It's round  my <
line 41564=>0  burden it is, too.'  Sam fumbled for the Ring and <
line 41565=>its chain. `But I suppose you must take it back.' Now it had come to it, Sam <
line 41566=> Ring and burden his master with it again. <
line 41567=>rden his master with it again. ?' gasped  Frodo. `You've  got  it  here? Sam, you're  a  <
line 41568=>marvel!'  Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. `Give it to  me!'  he <
line 41569=>cried, standing up, holding out  a trembling hand. `Give it  me at once! You  <
line 41570=>ve it!' <
line 41571=>odo,' said Sam, rather startled. 'Here it is!' Slowly <
line 41572=>he drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head.  `But you're in the <
line 41573=>land of Mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you'll see the Fiery Mountain <
line 41574=>and all. You'll find the Ring very dangerous now, and very hard to bear.  If <
line 41575=>are it with you, maybe?' <
line 41576=>     `No, no!'  cried Frodo, snatching the  Ring and chain from Sam's hands.  <
line 41577=>ef!'  He panted, staring at Sam  with eyes wide  with <
line 41578=>fear and enmity. Then  suddenly, clasping the Ring in one clenched  fist, he <
line 41579=>  to  clear from his eyes, and  he passed a  hand <
line 41580=>over  his  aching brow. The hideous vision had  seemed so real to  him, half <
line 41581=>und and fear. Sam had changed before his very <
line 41582=>am had changed before his very  again, leering and pawing  at his  treasure, a foul little <
line 41583=>creature with  greedy  eyes  and  slobbering  mouth. But  now the vision had <
line 41584=>passed.  There was Sam kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain,  as if <
line 41585=>been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes. <
line 41586=>     'O Sam!' cried Frodo. `What have I said? What have I done? Forgive  me! <
line 41587=>After all t is the horrible power of the Ring. I wish it had <
line 41588=>, been found. But don't mind me, Sam. I must carry the burden to <

line 41590=>ome between me and this doom.' t, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rubbing  his sleeve across his <
line 41591=><
line 41592=>####-eyes. `I understand. But I can still help, can't I? I've got to get  you out <
line 41593=>of  here. At  once, see! But first you want  some clothes  and gear and then <
line 41594=>some food.  The clothes will be the  easiest part. As we're in Mordor, we'd, <
line 41595=>fashion;  and anyway there isn't no choice. It'll have <
line 41596=>to  be orc-stuff  for you, Mr.  Frodo,  I'm afraid. And for me too. If we go <
line 41597=> Now put this round you!' <
line 41598=>     Sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about Frodo's  shoulders. Then <
line 41599=>unslinging his pack he laid  it on the floor. He drew Sting from its sheath. <
line 41600=>Hardly a flicker was to be seen upon  its blade. `I was forgetting this, Mr. <
line 41601=> didn't get everything! You lent me Sting, if you  <
line 41602=>remember, and the Lady's glass. I've  got them both still. But  lend them to <
line 41603=> I must go  and see what  I can find. You stay <
line 41604=>see what  I can find. You stay  a bit and ease your legs. I shan't be long.  I shan't  have <
line 41605=>to go far.' <
line 41606=>     `Take  care,  Sam!'  said Frodo. `And be quick! There may be orcs still <
line 41607=>lurking in wait.' <
line 41608=>     'I've  got to chance  it,' said  Sam. He  stepped to the  trap-door and <
line 41609=>minute  his head reappeared. He threw  a long <
line 41610=>d reappeared. He threw  a long r. <
line 41611=>appeared. He threw  a long r.  might be  useful,' he said. 'He's dead: the one <
line 41612=>that  whipped  you. Broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. Now you draw  up <
line 41613=>the ladder, if  you can, Mr. Frodo;  and don't you let it down till you hear <
line 41614=>rd. Elbereth   I'll call. What  the Elves say. No orc would <
line 41615=>say that.' <
line 41616=> while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing one another <
line 41617=>through his mind. Then he  got up, drew the grey elven-cloak about him,  and <
line 41618=>0, began to walk to and fro, prying and peering into <
line 41619=>every corner of his prison. <
line 41620=>     It was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least, before <
line 41621=>he  heard Sam's voice calling softly from  below:  Elbereth, Elbereth . Frodo <
line 41622=>let  down the light ladder. Up  came Sam, puffing, heaving a great bundle on  <
line 41623=>his head. He let it fall with a thud. <

line 41634=>leather. He  drew them on. Over the  tunic  went a coat  of stout ring-mail, <
line 41635=>c,  too long for  Frodo  and heavy. About it  he <
line 41636=>clasped  a belt, at which there hung a  short  sheath holding a broad-bladed <
line 41637=>stabbing-sword.  Sam  had brought  several  orc-helmets. One of  them fitted  <
line 41638=>0, a black  cap with iron rim, and  iron  hoops covered with <
line 41639=>leather  upon  which  the  evil  Eye was  painted  in red above the beaklike <
line 41640=>e Morgul-stuff,  Gorbag's gear,  was  a better fit and better made,' <
line 41641=>said Sam; 't do,  I  guess, to go  carrying his  tokens into <
line 41642=>Mordor,  not  after  this  business here. Well,  there you are, Mr. Frodo. A <
line 41643=>ake so bold-at least you would be, if we could <
line 41644=>east you would be, if we could with a mask,  give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged. <
line 41645=>This  will  hide some of the tell-tales.' He put a large  black cloak  round <
line 41646=>Frodo's shoulders. `Now you're ready! You can pick up a shield as we go.' <
line 41647=>0t about you, Sam?' said Frodo. `Aren't we going to match?' <
line 41648=>     `Well, Mr. Frodo, I've been  thinking,' said Sam. 'I'd best  not  leave <
line 41649=>any of, and we can't destroy it.  And  I can't wear orc-mail <
line 41650=> my clothes, can I? I'll just have to cover up.' <
line 41651=>     He knelt  down  and  carefully  folded his elven-cloak. It went  into a  <

line 41653=>s pack  that lay on the floor. lung  it behind his back,  put an orc-helm on  his head, and <
line 41654=>cast another  black cloak about  his  shoulders. `There!' he  said. `Now  we <
line 41655=>match, near enough. And now we must be off!' <
line 41656=>w we must be off!' I can't go all the way at a run, Sam,' said Frodo with a wry smile. 'I  <
line 41657=>hope you've made inquiries about inns along the road? Or  have you forgotten <
line 41658=>about food and drink?' <
line 41659=>     `Save me,  but so  I had!' said Sam.  He whistled in dismay. 'Bless me, <
line 41660=>Mr. Frodo, but you've gone and made me that hungry and thirsty! I don't know <
line 41661=>l last passed my lips. I'd forgotten it,  trying to find <
line 41662=>you.  But let  me  think!  Last time I looked  I'd got about enough of  that <
line 41663=>aptain Faramir gave us, to keep  me on my legs for a  <
line 41664=>couple of weeks at a pinch. But if there's a drop left in my bottle, there's <
line 41665=>going to be enough for two, nohow. Don't ores eat,  and <
line 41666=>don't they drink? Or do they just live on foul air and poison?' <
line 41667=>     `No, they eat and drink, Sam. The Shadow that  bred them can only mock, <
line 41668=>l new things of its own. I  don't think it gave life <
line 41669=>to the ores, it only  ruined them and twisted them; and if they are  to live <
line 41670=>ke  other living creatures. Foul waters and foul <
line 41671=>meats  they'll  take, if they can get no better, but not poison. They've fed <
line 41672=>me, and so I'm better off than you. There must be food and  water  somewhere <
line 41673=>ut there's no time to look for them,' said Sam. <
line 41674=>     `Well, things are a bit better than you think,' said Frodo. 'I have had <
line 41675=>a bit of luck while you were away. Indeed they did not take everything. I've <
line 41676=>mong some  rags  on  the  floor.  They've rummaged it, of <
line 41677=>course. But I  guess  they disliked  the very look and smell of  the lembas, <
line 41678=>It's scattered about  and some  of it is trampled and <
line 41679=>broken,  but I've gathered  it  together. It's not far short of  what you've <
line 41680=>  Faramir's  food,  and  they've  slashed  up  my <
line 41681=>water -bottle.' <
line 41682=>  to  be said,' said  Sam. `We've got enough  to <
line 41683=>start  on.  But the water's going to be a  bad business. But come Mr. Frodo!  <
line 41684=>Off we go, or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!' <
line 41685=>     'Not  till you've  had  a mouthful,  Sam,' said Frodo. `I won't  budge. <
line 41686=>ke, and  drink that last drop in  your  bottle!  The <
line 41687=>whole thing is quite hopeless, so it's no good worrying  about  tomorrow. It <
line 41688=>  At last they started. Down the ladder  they climbed, and then Sam  took  <
line 41689=>it ae passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc. The <
line 41690=>stair was dark, but on the roof-top the glare of the Mountain could still be <
line 41691=>ng down  now to  a  sullen red.  They  picked up two <
line 41692=>shields to complete their disguise and then went on. <
line 41693=> stairway they plodded. The  high chamber of the  turret <
line 41694=>behind, where they had met again, seemed almost homely: they were out in the <
line 41695=>rror ran along  the walls. All might be  dead in the <
line 41696=>Tower of Cirith Ungol, but it was steeped in fear and evil still. <
line 41697=>     At length they came to the door upon the outer court, and they  halted. <
line 41698=>0od they felt the malice  of the Watchers beating on <
line 41699=>them, black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare <
line 41700=> As they threaded their way among the hideous  <
line 41701=>d their way among the hideous  ores each step became more  difficult. Before they  even reached the <
line 41702=>archway they were brought to a stand. To move an inch further was a pain and <
line 41703=> will and limb. <
line 41704=>     Frodo  had no  strength  for such a  battle. He sank  to the ground. `I  <
line 41705=>can't go  on, Sam,' he  murmured. `I'm  going  to faint. I don't know what's <
line 41706=>   `I  do, Mr.  Frodo. Hold up  now! It's  the gate.  There's some devilry <
line 41707=>therhrough,  and  I'm going to  get  out.  It can't be  more <
line 41708=>dangerous than before. Now for it!' <
line 41709=>it!'     Sam drew  out the elven-glass of Galadriel again. As if to do honour to <
line 41710=>to grace with  splendour  his faithful  brown hobbit-hand  <
line 41711=>that had done such  deeds, the  phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the <
line 41712=>it with  a  dazzling  radiance  like lightning; but it <
line 41713=>remained steady and did not pass.  <
line 41714=>pass.   'Gilthoniel, A  Elbereth!' Sam  cried. For, why he  did  not know,  his <

line 41716=>drove away the Black Rider in the trees.  <
line 41717=>ve away the Black Rider in the trees.   cried Frodo once again behind him. <
line 41718=>rs was broken with a suddenness like the snapping  <
line 41719=>of a cord, and Frodo and Sam stumbled  forward. Then they  ran.  Through the <
line 41720=> figures with their glittering eyes. There was <
line 41721=>eir glittering eyes. There was ystone of the  arch  crashed almost on  their heels, and the <
line 41722=>wall  above crumbled, and fell in ruin. Only  by a  hair did  they escape. A <
line 41723=>bell clanged; and from the Watchers there went up  a high and dreadful wail.  <
line 41724=>up above in  the darkness it was answered . Out of the  black  sky there <
line 41725=>olt a winged shape, rending the clouds with  a ghastly  <
line 41726=> <
line 41727=> of Shadow <
line 41728=>þst wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast. <

line 41732=>In fifty paces, with a  swift  utting bastion  of the cliff, it took them out of sight from <

line 41736=>  In terror they  stumbled  on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward again <
line 41737=>and e  a dreadful  moment  to view from  the Tower. As  they <
line 41738=>flitted  across they  glanced  back  and saw the  great black shape upon the <
line 41739=>0nged down between high rock -walls in a cu tting that <
line 41740=>fell steeply to join  the  Morgul-road. They came to  the way-meeting. There <
line 41741=> nor  of  an answer to the cry of the Nazgyl; but <
line 41742=>they  knew that the silence would not last  long. At any moment now the hunt <
line 41743=>do, Sam,' said Frodo. 'If we were real orcs, we ought to be <
line 41744=>dashing back  to the  Tower, not running away. The  first enemy we meet will <
line 41745=>off this road somehow.' <
line 41746=>     'But we can't,' said Sam, 'not without wings.' <
line 41747=>aces of the Ephel DÂ®ath  were  sheer, falling in cliff and <
line 41748=>precipice to the black trough that lay between  them  and the inner ridge. A <
line 41749=>short way beyond the  way-meeting,  after another  steep  incline,  a flying <
line 41750=>bridge  of stone  leapt over the chasm  and  bore  the road  across into the <
line 41751=>0of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt Frodo and Sam <
line 41752=>dashed along the bridge;  but  they had  hardly reached its further end when <
line 41753=>begin. Away  behind them, now high above on the <
line 41754=>mountain-side, loomed  the  Tower of Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully. <
line 41755=>Suddenly its harsh bell clanged  again, and  then broke  into  a  shattering <
line 41756=>d.  And now  from beyond  the  bridge-end came  <
line 41757=>answering <
line 41758=>cries. Down in the dark trough,  cut off from the dying  glare of  Orodruin, <
line 41759=> could not see ahead, but  already  they heard the  tramp of <
line 41760=>iron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs. <
line 41761=>we  go!'  cried Frodo. They scrambled  on to  the low <
line 41762=>parapet of the  bridge. Fortunately there  was no  longer any dreadful  drop <
line 41763=>pes of the Morgai had already risen almost to the <
line 41764=>level of the road;  but it was too dark for them to  guess  the depth of the <
line 41765=>r. Frodo,' said Sam. 'Good-bye!' <
line 41766=> Frodo,' said Sam. 'Good-bye!' . And even as they fell they heard the rush of <
line 41767=>g over  the bridge  and  the rattle  of orc-feet  running up <
line 41768=>behind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared. Half fearing a breaking <
line 41769=>plunseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than <
line 41770=>n feet, with a thud  and  a crunch  into the last  thing that they had <
line 41771=>orny bushes.  There Sam  lay still, softly sucking a  <
line 41772=>scratched hand. <
line 41773=> hoof  and foot  had passed  he ventured a  whisper. <
line 41774=>'Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but I didn't know as anything grew in Mordor! But if I <
line 41775=>had a'known, this is just what I'd have  looked  for. These thorns must be a  <
line 41776=>foot long by the feel of them; they've stuck through everything I've got on. <

line 41778=>0eep  these thorns out,'  said Frodo.  'Not  even  a  <
line 41779=>leather jerkin is any good.' <
line 41780=>     They had a  struggle  to get out of the thicket. The thorns  and briars <
line 41781=>were as tough clinging as  claws. Their cloaks were rent and <
line 41782=>they broke free at last. <
line 41783=>     'Now down we  go, Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'Down into  the  valley quick , <
line 41784=>, as soon as ever we can.' <
line 41785=>     Day was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of <
line 41786=>imbing over the eastern  rim of Middle-earth; but here <
line 41787=>all was still dark as night. The Mountain smoulder ed and its fires went out. <

line 41789=>ever since  they  left  Ithilien now seemed dead.  Slowly and painfully they <

line 41791=>bling among rock and briar and ind shadows, down and down until they could go no further. <
line 41792=>     At  length they stopped, and sat  side  by  side, their backs against a  <
line 41793=>boulder. Both were sweating.  'If Shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of <

line 41795=>I'd shake his hand,' said Sam. s!' said Frodo. 'It only makes it  worse.' Then he <
line 41796=>stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while. At <
line 41797=>last with a struggle he got up again. To his amazement he found that Sam was <
line 41798=>asleep.  'Wake  up,  Sam!'  he  said. 'Come on! It's time  we  made  another <
line 41799=>effort.' <
line 41800=>     Sam scrambled  to  his feet.  'Well I  never!' he  said.  'I  must have <

line 41818=>if I could. Let it go then!' <
line 41819=>     Frodo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it away. <
line 41820=>He shivered a little. 'What I really need is something warm,' he said. 'It's <
line 41821=>lse I've caught a chill.' <
line 41822=>     'You can have my cloak,  Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. He unslung his  pack and  <
line 41823=>ak. 'How's  this, Mr.  Frodo?' he said. 'You wrap that <
line 41824=>orc-rag close round you, and  put the belt outside it. Then this can go over <
line 41825=>e orc-fashion, but it'll  keep you  warmer; and  I <
line 41826=>daresay it'll  keep you from harm better than any other gear. It was made by <

line 41832=>     'There  now, Mr.  Frodo, it's you  that's  talking of water this time!' <
line 41833=>said Sam. 'If only the  Lady could see us or hear us, I'd say to  her: (Your <

line 41835=>daylight, better than any jewels,  begging your pardon.( But it's a long way <

line 41843=>inst a sky that was turning grey, the peaks and <
line 41844=>high  ridges  of  the great range began  to appear  dark and black,  visible <
line 41845=>0hapes. Light  was growing behind them.  Slowly it crept towards the  North. <

line 41847=>s of Mordor were being driven back, their edges tattering as a wind out <
line 41848=>me up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark <
line 41849=>land of their home. Under  the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light <
line 41850=>leaked intoe morning through the grimed window of a prison. <
line 41851=>it, Mr. Frodo!'  said  Sam. 'Look  at it!  The wind's changed. <
line 41852=>Something's happening. He's not having it all  his own way.  His darkness is <
line 41853=> the world there. I wish I could see what is going on!' <
line 41854=>     It was  the morning  of the fifteenth of  March,  and over the  Vale of <
line 41855=>0  above the eastern shadow, and the south-west wind <
line 41856=>was blowing. Thjoden lay dying on the Pelennor Fields.  <
line 41857=>Sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all along the <
line 41858=>line  of the Ephel DÂ®ath, and then they saw a shape, moving at a great speed <
line 41859=>first only a  black speck against  the glimmering strip <
line 41860=>above the mountain-tops, but  growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the <
line 41861=>0gh above them. As it went it sent out a long shrill  <
line 41862=>cry, the voice of a Nazgyl; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: <
line 41863=>ay, ill tidings for the Dark Tower. The Lord  of <
line 41864=><
line 41865=>####-the Ring-wraiths had met his doom. <
line 41866=>t his doom.  'What did I tell you? Something's happening!'  cried Sam. '  (The  war's <
line 41867=>agrat; but Gorbag he  wasn't so sure. And  he was right <
line 41868=>there too. Things are looking up, Mr. Frodo. Haven't you got some hope now?' <
line 41869=>0,  Sam,'  Frodo  sighed. 'That's  away  beyond  the <
line 41870=>mountains.  We're going east not west. And I'm  so tired. And the Ring  is so  <
line 41871=>o  see it in my mind  all the time, like a  great <
line 41872=>wheel of fire.' <
line 41873=>sank again  at  once. He  looked  at  his master  <
line 41874=>anxiously, and he took his hand.  'Come, Mr.  Frodo!' he said. 'I've got one <
line 41875=>thing  I  wanted: a bit of light. Enough  to help  us, and yet I guess  it's <
line 41876=>dangerous too. Try a bit further,  and then we'll lie close and have a rest. <
line 41877=>But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the E lves' food; it may hearten you.' <
line 41878=>er of   lembas, and  munching it as  best they could with <
line 41879=>their parched  mouths. Frodo and Sam  plodded on. The light,  though no more <
line 41880=>than a grey  dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the <
line 41881=>0etween  the mountains. It sloped  up gently  northward,  and at its <
line 41882=>now dry  and  withered stream.  Beyond  its stony <
line 41883=>course  they saw a beaten  path that  wound  its way under the  feet of  the <
line 41884=>,  they could have reached it quicker, for it <
line 41885=>ave reached it quicker, for it  left the main Morgul-road at the  western  bridge-end  and <
line 41886=>went down  by  a long stair cut in the rock to the valley's  bottom.  It was <
line 41887=>used  by  patrols  or  by  messengers going  swiftly  to  lesser  posts  and <
line 41888=>olds north-away, between Cirith Ungol and the narrows of  Isenmouthe, <
line 41889=>0ngren. <
line 41890=>r the hobbits to use  such  a path,  but they needed <
line 41891=>speed, and  Frodo felt that he could not face the  toil of  scrambling among <
line 41892=>less glens  of  the Morgai. And  he  judged that <
line 41893=>northward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would least expect them  to <
line 41894=>take.  The  road east  to the plain, or the pass back westward,  those  they <
line 41895=> most thoroughly. Only when he was well north of the Tower  <
line 41896=>did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east, east on the last <
line 41897=>is journey. So now  they crossed the stony bed and took  <
line 41898=>to  the orc-path, and  for some time  they  marched along  it. The cliffs at <
line 41899=>g, and they could  not be seen  from above; but  the <
line 41900=>path made many bends, and at each  bend they  gripped their  sword-hilts and <
line 41901=>###-     The  light grew no stronger,  for  Orodruin was still belching forth  a  <
line 41902=>hat, beaten  upwards by  the  opposing airs, mounted higher and  <
line 41903=> region  above  the  wind  and  spread  in  an <
line 41904=>the  wind  and  spread  in  an f, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their <
line 41905=>view. They had  trudged for more than an hour  when they heard a sound  that <
line 41906=>lt. Unbelievable, but unmistakable. Water trickling. Out <
line 41907=>of a gully on the left, so sharp  and narrow  that it look ed as if the black  <
line 41908=>by some  huge  axe, water came dripping down: the last <
line 41909=>remains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered  from sunlit seas, but ill-fated <
line 41910=>walls of  the Black Land and wander fruitless down <
line 41911=>into  the dust. Here it came out of  the rock in a little falling streamlet, <
line 41912=>and turning south  ran away swiftly to be lost  <
line 41913=>among the dead stones.  <
line 41914=>s it. 'If ever I see the Lady again, I will tell her!' <
line 41915=>he cried . 'Light  and now  water!' Then he stopped. 'Let me  drink first Mr. <
line 41916=>Frodo,' he said. <
line 41917=>     'All right, but there's room enough for two.' <
line 41918=>n  that,'  said  Sam.  'I  mean:  if it's  poisonous,  or  <
line 41919=>something  that will  show  its  badness quick, well,  better me  than  you, <
line 41920=>master, if you understand me.' <
line 41921=>     'I do. But I think we'll trust our luck together, Sam; or our blessing. <
line 41922=>Still, be careful now, if it's very cold!' <
line 41923=>l, be careful now, if it's very cold!' not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, a t once <
line 41924=>bitter and  oily, or  so they would have said at home. Here it seemed beyond <
line 41925=>all  praise, and beyond fear  or  prudence. They  drank their  fill, and Sam <
line 41926=>rater -bottle. After that Frodo felt easier, and they went on <
line 41927=>for several miles, until the broadening of the road and  the beginnings of a  <
line 41928=>rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another  <
line 41929=>orc-hold. <
line 41930=>     'This  is  where  we  turn aside, Sam,' said  Frodo. 'And we  must turn <
line 41931=> sighed as he looked a t  the gloomy ridges across the  valley. 'I  <
line 41932=>ength left to find  some hole  away up there. And  <
line 41933=>then I must rest a little.' <
line 41934=>-bed  was now some way  below the path. They scrambled down to <
line 41935=>it,  and began to cross  it. To their surprise they came upon dark pools fed <
line 41936=>ter trickling down from some source  higher up the valley.  <
line 41937=><
line 41938=>####-Upon its  outer marges under the westward mountains Mordor was a dying <
line 41939=> yet dead. And here things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter, <
line 41940=>struggling  for life. In  the glens of the Morgai on the other  side  of the <
line 41941=> trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought  <
line 41942=>with the stones,  and withered mosses crawled on them; and  everywhere great <
line 41943=>mbles sprawled. Some  had  long stabbing  thorns,  some <
line 41944=>hooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen shrivelled leaves of  a  past  <
line 41945=>ating  and  rattling  in  the  sad airs,  but  their <
line 41946=>maggot-ridden buds were  only  just  opening. Flies,  dun or grey, or black, <
line 41947=> eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung;  and above <
line 41948=>the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled. <
line 41949=>s no  good,' said Sam, waving his  arms. 'I  wish I'd  got  an <
line 41950=>orc's hide!' <
line 41951=>o  could  go  no further.  They had  climbed  up  a narrow <
line 41952=>shelving ravine, but  they still had a long way to go before they could even <
line 41953=>ast craggy ridge. 'I must rest  now, Sam, and sleep if <
line 41954=>I can.' said Frodo.  He looked  about, but there seemed  nowhere even for an <
line 41955=>his  dismal  country.  At length,  tired out, they <
line 41956=>slunk  under a  curtain  of brambles that hung  down  like a  mat over a low <
line 41957=>at and  made such a meal as they could. Keeping  back  the <
line 41958=>precious  lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained <
line 41959=>r's provision: some  dried fruit, and a small  slip of <
line 41960=>cured meat; and they sipped some water. They  had drunk again from the pools <
line 41961=>re very, thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in <
line 41962=>the air of Mordor  that dried the mouth. When Sam thought of water  even his <
line 41963=>d  the Morgai there was the dreadful plain  of <

line 41966=>again. I reckon this day is nearly over.' <
line 41967=>rly over.'     Frodo sighed and was  asleep almost before  the words were  spoken. Sam <
line 41968=>struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat <
line 41969=>silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled <
line 41970=>and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking  and <
line 41971=>cracking and sly noises, but there was  no  sound of  voice or  of foot. Far <
line 41972=> the West  the night-sky  was still dim and  pale. <

line 41975=>te star twinkle for  a while. The beauty of it smote  <
line 41976=>his heart, as he looked  up  out  of the forsaken land, and hope returned to <
line 41977=>ar and cold, the thought pierced  him that in the <
line 41978=>end the Shadow was  only a small and passing thing: there was light and high <
line 41979=>ch. His song in  the Tower had been  defiance <
line 41980=>  the Tower had been  defiance ;  for  then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment,  <
line 41981=>his own fate,  and even his masters, ceased to trouble him. He crawled  back  <
line 41982=>into the  brambles and  laid  himself by Frodo's side ,  and putting away all <

line 41984=> into a deep untroubled sleep. together, hand in  hand.  Sam was  almost fresh,  ready  for  <
line 41985=>another day; but Frodo sighed.  His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of <
line 41986=>fire, and  waking  brought  him no comfort.  Still  his sleep  had not  been <
line 41987=>without  all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able  to  bear his burden <
line 41988=> did not know the time, nor how long  they had slept;  <
line 41989=>but after a morsel of food and a sip of water  they went  on up  the ravine, <
line 41990=>slope of screes and sliding stones. There the last  <
line 41991=>living things gave up their struggle; the tops of the Morgai were grassless,  <
line 41992=>ate. <
line 41993=>and search they found a way that they could climb, <
line 41994=>and with a last hundred feet  of clawing scramble they were up. They came to <
line 41995=>, and passing through found  themselves on the <
line 41996=>rough found  themselves on the  last  fence of Mordor. Below them, at the  bottom of a fall <
line 41997=>of  some fifteen hundred feet,  lay  the inner plain stretching away into  a  <
line 41998=>formless gloom beyond their sight. The wind  of the world blew now from  the <
line 41999=> and  the great clouds  were lifted  high,  floating away eastward; but <
line 42000=>t came to the dreary fields of Gorgoroth. There smokes <
line 42001=>on the ground and lurked in hollows, and fumes  leaked from fissures <
line 42002=>far away, forty  miles  at least,  they  saw Mount Doom, its feet <
line 42003=>uge cone rising  to  a great height,  where its <
line 42004=>as swathed in cloud. Its fires were now  dimmed, and it stood <
line 42005=>0n smouldering slumber, as threatening and  dangerous as a  sleeping  beast.  <
line 42006=>ng a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of <
line 42007=>Barad-dyr  that was  reared far  way upon a long spur of the Ashen Mountains <
line 42008=>orth. The Dark Power was deep in  thought, and the Eye <
line 42009=>turned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a  bright sword, and a  <
line 42010=>0ace  it  saw, and for  a while it gave  little thought to <
line 42011=>other things;  and  all its great  stronghold, gate on  gate,  and tower  on <
line 42012=> brooding gloom. <
line 42013=>     Frodo and Sam gazed out in  mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful <
line 42014=>land. Between them and  the smoking mountain, and about  it north and south, <
line 42015=>all seemed ruinous and dead, a  desert burned  and choked. They wondered <
line 42016=>how <
line 42017=>the Lord of  this realm maintained  and  fed his  slaves and his armies. Yet <
line 42018=>r as their  eyes could reach, along the  skirts  of the <
line 42019=>Morgai and away southward,  there were camps, some  of tents,  some  ordered <

line 42021=>mile  out into  the  plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with <

line 42023=>ground  was  busy  with folk  going  to and  fro; a  wide  road  ran from it <

line 42029=>all wrong.' <
line 42030=>     Neither  he nor Frodo knew  anything of  the great slave-worked  fields <

line 42032=>sad waters  of Lake  NÂ®rnen; nor of  the great roads that ran away  east and <

line 42039=>moment  it withdrew  them,  and  brought  up new forces, massing  them about <
line 42040=>n avenging stroke. And if it had also been its purpose to <
line 42041=>defend the Mountain against all approach, it could scarcely have done more. <
line 42042=>. 'Whatever they have to eat and drink, we can't get <
line 42043=>it. There's no way down that I can see. And we couldn't cross  all that open <
line 42044=>s, even if we did get down.' <
line 42045=>     'Still  we  shall  have to  try,'  said  Frodo.  'It's  no worse than I <
line 42046=>expected. I never hoped to get across. I can't see any  hope  of it now. But <

line 42050=>see what it is like where the open plain is narrower.' <
line 42051=>     'I guess what it'll be like,' said  Sam. 'Where it's narrower the  Orcs <
line 42052=>oser. You'll see, Mr. Frodo.' <
line 42053=>     'I dare say I shall, if  we ever get so  far,'  said  Frodo  and turned <
line 42054=>away. <
line 42055=>     They  soon  found that it was impossible  to  make their way  along the <
line 42056=>ere along its  higher levels, pathless as they <
line 42057=>igher levels, pathless as they  with deep ghylls. In the end they were  forced to  go  back  <
line 42058=>down the ravine that they had  climbed and seek for a way  along the valley. <
line 42059=>,  for  they  dared not  cross  over  to the  path on the <
line 42060=>westward side. After a mile or more  they  saw,  huddled in a  hollow at the <
line 42061=>hold that  they had guessed  was near at hand: a wall <
line 42062=>and a cluster of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave. There was no  <

line 42067=>sight behind them; but  they had hardly begun  to breathe  more freely again <
line 42068=>when harsh and loud they heard orc-voices. Quickly  they  slunk out of sight <
line 42069=>stunted bush.  The voices drew nearer. Presently two orcs <
line 42070=>came  into view. One was  clad in ragged  brown and was armed with a  bow of <
line 42071=>ll  breed, black -skinned,  with  wide  and  snuffling <
line 42072=>nostrils:  evidently  a   tracker  of  some  kind.  The  other  was   a  big <
line 42073=>f Shagrat's company, bearing the token of the Eye. <
line 42074=>He  also had  a  bow at his back and carried  a short broad-headed spear. As <

line 42113=>     'You come back,' shouted the soldier, 'or I'll report you!' <
line 42114=>     'Who to? Not to your precious Shagrat. He won't be captain any more.' <

line 42116=>lowering his voice to a hiss. 'One of them's in charge at the Tower now.' <
line 42117=>     The other halted, and his voice was  full of fear and rage. 'You cursed <
line 42118=>hief!' he yelled. 'You can't do  your job, and you can't even <
line 42119=>stick by your own folk. Go to your filthy Shriekers, and may they freeze the <

line 42123=>behind  a  stone,  put an arrow in  his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a  <
line 42124=>crash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared. <
line 42125=>     For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length  Sam stirred. 'Well I <
line 42126=>eat as neat,'  he said. 'If this nice friendliness would spread <

line 42128=>     'Quietly,  Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'There  may be  others about. We have <

line 42136=>this time.  'Did you hear what they  said  about  that gobbler, Mr.  Frodo? I <

line 42138=>m wasn't dead yet, didn't I?' ber. And I wondered  how you knew,' said Frodo. 'Well come <

line 42140=>all tell me how you know, a nd all about what happened. <

line 42159=> heights, long after day had opened in the lands <
line 42160=>beyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. In his <
line 42161=>times  of waking  Sam  was busy  with thoughts  of food. At  last when Frodo <
line 42162=> spoke of eating and making ready for yet  another effort, <
line 42163=>he asked the question that was troubling him most. <
line 42164=>ur pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he said, 'but have you any notion how <
line 42165=>far there is still to go?' <
line 42166=>     'No, not any clear notion, Sam, ' Frodo answered. 'In Rivendell before I <
line 42167=>ap of Mordor that was made before the Enemy came <
line 42168=>back <
line 42169=>here; but I only remember it  vaguely. I remember clearest  that there was a  <

line 42173=>course, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the Mountain, <
line 42174=>sixty miles from it,  I should think. I guess that we have gone about twelve <
line 42175=>m the bridge now.  Even if  all goes  well, I could hardly <
line 42176=>reach  the Mountain in  a week. I am afraid, Sam, that the  burden  will get <

line 42178=>till slower as we get nearer.' just as I feared,' he said. 'Well,  to say nothing <
line 42179=>of water, we've got to eat less, Mr.  Frodo,  or else move a bit quicker, at <
line 42180=>any rate while we're still in this valley. One more bite  and all the food's <
line 42181=>Elves' waybread.' <
line 42182=>y  and be  a  bit  quicker, Sam,'  said  Frodo,  drawing a deep <
line 42183=>art another march!' <
line 42184=> not yet quite dark again. They plodded along, on into the night. <
line 42185=>stumbling trudge with a few brief halts. At the <
line 42186=>grey light  under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid <
line 42187=>0hemselves again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stone. <
line 42188=>     Slowly  the  light  grew, until it  was clearer than it yet had been. A <
line 42189=> West was now driving the fumes of Mordor from the <
line 42190=>upper <
line 42191=>airs. Before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for  some <
line 42192=>e trough  between the  mountains  and  the Morgai had <

line 42194=>####-steadily dwindled as it climbed upwards, and the inner ridge was now no more <
line 42195=>teep faces of the Ephel DÂ®ath; but to  the east it fell <
line 42196=>as  sheerly as  ever down into Gorgoroth. Ahead the water -course came  to an <
line 42197=>rock; for out from the main range there sprang a high <
line 42198=>barren spur, thrusting  eastward like a wall. To meet it there stretched out <
line 42199=>rthern  range  of Ered Lithui a long jutting arm; <
line 42200=>and between the ends there  was a narrow gap: Carach Angren, the Isenmouthe, <
line 42201=>e of Udyn.  In that dale  behind the Morannon <
line 42202=>that dale  behind the Morannon and deep armouries that the servants of Mordor had made for  <
line 42203=>the defence of the Black Gate of their  land; and there now  their  Lord was <
line 42204=>gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the <
line 42205=>Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and watch-fires <
line 42206=>  the gap an earth-wall had been  raised, and a deep <

line 42209=>d the old castle  of Durthang, now one of  the <
line 42210=>  of Durthang, now one of  the that  clustered about  the dale of  Udyn.  A  road,  already <
line 42211=>visible in the growing light, came winding  down from it, until only a  mile <
line 42212=>or two from where the hobbits  lay it turned east and ran along a  shelf cut <
line 42213=> side of the  spur, and so went  down  into the plain,  and  on to the <
line 42214=>e hobbits as  they  looked  out it seemed that all their  journey <
line 42215=>north had been useless. The plain to their right was dim and smoky, and they <
line 42216=>could  see  there  neither camps nor troops moving; but all  that region was <
line 42217=>under the vigilance of the for ts of Carach Angren. <
line 42218=>     'We have  come to a dead end, Sam,'  said Frodo. 'If we go on, we shall <

line 42233=>debate the matter, and Sam did not tell  him that he had drunk the last drop <
line 42234=>d eaten Sam's share of the food as well as  his own. When <
line 42235=>Frodo was asleep Sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned <
line 42236=>ed and thin, and yet in  sleep it looked  content and <
line 42237=>unafraid. 'Well, here goes, Master!' Sam muttered  to himself. 'I'll have to <
line 42238=>ust to luck. Water we must have, or we'll  get no <
line 42239=>further.' <
line 42240=>     Sam  crept  out,  and flitting  from  stone to  stone  with  more  than <
line 42241=> down to the water -course, and then followed it for some <
line 42242=>way as it climbed  north, until he came to the rock -steps where long ago, no  <
line 42243=>d come gushing  down  in  a little  waterfall. All  now <

line 42246=>he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out  from the  hill -side  and <
line 42247=> from which again it spilled, and vanished  then <
line 42248=>under the barren stones. <
line 42249=>water, and it seemed good enough. Then  he drank deeply,  <
line 42250=>refilled the  bottle,  and turned  to go back.  At that  moment he caught  a  <
line 42251=>glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near Frodo's <
line 42252=>hiding-place.  Biting  back  a cry, he leapt  down from the spring and  ran, <
line 42253=>e. It was  a  wary creature, difficult to see, but <
line 42254=>Sam had little doubt about it: he longed to get  his hands on its  neck. But <
line 42255=>ed quickly away.  Sam  thought he  saw a  last  <
line 42256=>fleeting  glimpse  of  it,  peering  back  over  the  edge  of the  eastward <
line 42257=>precipice, before it ducked and disappeared. <

line 42283=>towards  the Isenmouthe  twenty miles away. It was not a broad road, and  it  <

line 42316=>line, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and shouting. File <

line 42319=>0spied the two figures  by the road-side. He flicked <

line 42328=>soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear  of  the line. 'No, not at the <

line 42330=> up. And stay there, or you'll  come down the line!' He sent his  long  whip-lash  cracking  <
line 42331=>over their heads; then with another crack  and a yell he started the company <
line 42332=>off again at a brisk trot. <
line 42333=> for poor Sam, tired a s he was;  but for Frodo it was <
line 42334=>t, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop his mind <
line 42335=>uggled  on. The stench of the sweating  orcs about <

line 42340=>and jeered at them. <
line 42341=>flicking at their  legs. 'Where there's a whip <

line 42346=>slope into the plain, when  Frodo's  strength began to give out and his will <
line 42347=>umbled. Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold <
line 42348=>him up,  though  he felt  that he could  himself hardly  stay  the pace much <
line 42349=>knew that the end would come: his master <
line 42350=>the end would come: his master and  all would be discovered, and  their bitter efforts be in <
line 42351=>vain.  'I'll have that big slave-driving devil anyway,' he thought. <
line 42352=>     Then just as  he  was putting his hand  to the hilt of his sword, there <
line 42353=>cted relief.  They were out on the plain now and drawing  near <
line 42354=>the entrance to Udyn. Some  way in  front  of it,  before  the  gate  at the <
line 42355=>broad  from the  west converged with others coming from  the <
line 42356=>h, and from Barad-dyr.  Along all the roads troops were moving; for  the  <
line 42357=>st  were  advancing  and the Dark Lord was speeding his <
line 42358=>forces  north.  So it  chanced that  several companies came together at  the <
line 42359=>0 beyond the light of  the watch-fires on the  wall. <
line 42360=>At once there was great  jostling  and  cursing as  each troop  tried to get <
line 42361=>ing of  their march.  Though the drivers yelled <
line 42362=>and plied  their whips, scuffles broke out and  some blades  were  drawn.  A <
line 42363=>troop of heavy-armed uruks from Barad-dyr charged into the Durthang line and <
line 42364=>fusion. <
line 42365=>ith  pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly <
line 42366=>at his chance, and  threw  himself to the  ground, dragging Frodo down  with  <
line 42367=>snarling and  cursing. Slowly on hand and knee the <
line 42368=>hobbits  crawled  away  out of  the  turmoil, until  at last unnoticed  they <

line 42370=>t  had a  high kerb  by  which uld  guide  themselves  in black night or  fog,  and it  was <
line 42371=>banked up some feet above the level of the open land. <
line 42372=>     They  lay still   for a while.  It  was too dark to  seek  for cover, if <
line 42373=>d; but Sam felt that  they ought at least to get <
line 42374=>further away from the highways and out of the range of torch-light. <
line 42375=>     'Come on, Mr. Frodo!' he whispered.  'One more  crawl, and then you can <

line 42377=>struggled on for maybe twenty yards. Then he pitched down into a shallow pit <
line 42378=>ctedly before them, and there he lay like a dead thing. <
line 42379=><
line 42380=>####- <
line 42381=>     Sam put his ragged orc-cloak under  his master's head, and covered them <
line 42382=> robe of Lurien; and as he did so his thoughts went out to <
line 42383=>that fair land, and to the Elves, and he hoped that the cloth woven by their <
line 42384=>e virtue to keep them  hidden beyond all hope  in this <
line 42385=>wilderness of fear. He heard the  scuffling and cries die down as the troops <
line 42386=>nmouthe. It seemed that in the confusion  and  the <
line 42387=>mingling of many  companies of various  kinds  they had not been missed, not <
line 42388=>ok a sip of water, but pressed Frodo  to  drink,  and  when  his <
line 42389=>master had reche gave  him a whole  wafer of their  precious <
line 42390=>e  him  ea t it. Then, too worn out even to  feel  much fear,  <
line 42391=>they stretched themselves out. They slept a little in uneasy fits; for their <
line 42392=>n  them, and the  hard stones bit them, and they shivered. <
line 42393=>Out of  the north from the  Black Gate  through  Cirith  Gorgor there flowed <
line 42394=>round a thin cold air. <
line 42395=>     In the morning a  grey light came again, for  in  the high regions  the <
line 42396=>West Wind  still blew, but down on the stones behind the fences of the Black <
line 42397=>Land the air seemed almost dead, chill  and yet stifling. Sam looked  up out <

line 42402=> off like a  dark standing shadow. loomed  the  Mountain. <
line 42403=>Smokes  were  pouring from  it and while those that rose into  the upper air <
line 42404=> great rolling clouds  floated  down  its  sides  and <
line 42405=>spread over the land. A  few miles to the north-east the  foothills  of  the <

line 42407=>northern heights rose  like  a line of distant cloud hardly darker than  the <

line 42410=>tain, 'and that'll take a week, if it takes  a day, with <
line 42411=>Mr. Frodo as he is.' He shook his  head,  and as he worked things out, slowly  <
line 42412=>ht  grew in his mind. Never  for long had  hope died in  his <
line 42413=>staunch  heart, and  always until now he  had  taken some thought  for their <
line 42414=>tter  truth  came  home to him  at  last:  at best their <
line 42415=>provision  would take them to  their goal; and when the task was done, there <

line 42417=>terrible desert. There could be no return. <
line 42418=>rible desert. There could be no return. elt I had to  do when  I started,' thought Sam: <
line 42419=>rodo to the last step and then die with him? Well, if that is <
line 42420=>the job then I must do it. But I would dearly like to see Bywater again, and <
line 42421=>r brothers, and the Gaffer and Marigold  and all. I can't <
line 42422=>think somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there <
line 42423=>e  of his  ever coming back at all. Things  all  went <
line 42424=>wrong when  he went  down  in Moria.  I  wish he hadn't. He  would have done <
line 42425=>as hope died in Sam, or seemed to  die, it was turned to a new <
line 42426=>strength. Sam's  plain  hobbit-face  grew stern,  almost  grim, as  the will <
line 42427=>nd he felt through  all his  limbs a thrill,  as if he was <
line 42428=>turning into  some  creature  of   stone  and steel  that neither despair nor  <
line 42429=>s barren miles could subdue. <
line 42430=>     With  a new sense of responsibility he  brought  his  eyes  back to the <
line 42431=>ground  near at hand, studying the  next move. As the light grew a little he <
line 42432=>saw  to  his  surprise  that  what  from  a  distance  had  seemed  wide and <
line 42433=> in fact  all broken  and tumbled. Indeed the  whole <
line 42434=>surface of the plains of Gorgoroth was pocked with great holes, as if, while <
line 42435=> mud,  it had been smitten with a shower of bolts <
line 42436=>and huge slingstones. The largest of these holes  were rimmed with ridges of <
line 42437=>s ran out from them in all directions. It was <
line 42438=>them in all directions. It was t would be possible to  creep from hiding to hiding, unseen <
line 42439=>by all but the most watchful eyes: possible at least for one  who was strong <
line 42440=>and had no need for speed. For the hungry and worn, who had far to go before <
line 42441=>iled, it had an evil look. <
line 42442=>     Thinking  of all  these things Sam went back to his  master.  He had no <
line 42443=>need trodo was lying on his  back with eyes open, staring at <
line 42444=>the  cloudy sky. 'Well, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'I've been having a look round <
line 42445=>and thinkis  nothing on the roads, and we'd best  be getting <
line 42446=>here's a chance. Can you manage it?' <
line 42447=> a chance. Can you manage it?' id Frodo. 'I must.' <
line 42448=><
line 42449=>####-     Once more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting behind <
line 42450=>uld find,  but moving always in  a slant towards  the <
line 42451=>foothills of the northern  range. But as they went the  most easterly of the <
line 42452=>it ran  off, hugging the skirts of the mountains, <
line 42453=>away into a wall of black shadow far ahead. Neither  man  nor orc now  moved <
line 42454=>for the Dark Lord  had almost  completed  the <
line 42455=>rd  had almost  completed  the orces, and even in the  fastness of his own realm he sought <
line 42456=>the secrecy of night, fearing the winds of the world that had turned against <
line 42457=>him, tearing aside his veils, and troubled with  tidings of  bold spies that <
line 42458=>sed through his fences. <
line 42459=>     The hobbits had  gone a few weary  miles when they halted. Frodo seemed <
line 42460=>nearly  sat he could not  go much further in  this  fashion, <
line 42461=>crawling, stooping, now picking  a doubtful way very slowly, now hurrying at <
line 42462=>a stumbling rgoing  back on to the road while the light lasts, Mr.  Frodo,' he <
line 42463=>It nearly failed us  last time,  but  it didn't <
line 42464=>quite. A steady pace for a few more miles, and then a rest.' <
line 42465=>0g a far greater risk  than he knew; but  Frodo was too much <
line 42466=>occupied  with his burden and with the  struggle in  his mind to debate, and <
line 42467=>to care. They climbed  on to the  causeway and  trudged <
line 42468=>along, down the hard cruel road that led to the Dark Tower itself. But their <
line 42469=>0st of that day they  met no living or moving thing; <
line 42470=>and when night fell they vanished into the darkness of Mordor. All  the land <
line 42471=>of a  great storm: for the Captains of the West  <
line 42472=>had passed  the Cross-roads and  set  flames  in  the deadly fields of Imlad <
line 42473=>Morgul. <
line 42474=>  journey  went  on, as the Ring went  south and  the <
line 42475=>banners of the  kings rode  north. For the hobbits each day,  each mile. was <
line 42476=>efore, as  their  strength lessened and  the land <
line 42477=>became more  evil.  They met no enemies by day. At times  by night,  as they <
line 42478=>some hiding beside the road, they heard cries <
line 42479=>ide the road, they heard cries f  many  feet or the swift passing of some  cruelly  ridden <
line 42480=>steed. But far  worse than all  such  perils was the ever -approaching threat <
line 42481=>that  beat  upon them as they went: the  dreadful menace of  the  Power that <
line 42482=>, brooding in  deep thought and sleepless malice behind  the dark veil  <
line 42483=>arer  and nearer it drew,  looming blacker, like  the <
line 42484=>0of a wall of night at the last end of the world. <
line 42485=>re  came at  last a dreadful nightfall; and even  as the Captains of <
line 42486=>end of the living lands, the two wanderers came to  <
line 42487=>an  hour of blank despair. Four days had passed since they had  escaped from <
line 42488=>behind  them like an ever -darkening  dream. All <
line 42489=>this  last  day Frodo  had not  spoken,  but had  walked  half-bowed,  often <
line 42490=>stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet. Sam guessed <
line 42491=>heir  pains he  bore the worst, the growing weight  of the <
line 42492=>Ring, a  burden on  the  body and a torment  to his  mind. Anxiously Sam had <
line 42493=>s left hand would often be raised  as if to ward  on a  <
line 42494=>blow,  or to  screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful  Eye that sought  to <
line 42495=>0imes  his right  hand  would creep  to  his breast, <
line 42496=>clutching, and  then  slowly,  as  the will recovered mastery, it  would  be <
line 42497=>lackness of night  returned Frodo sat, his head between his <
line 42498=>knees, his arms  hanging wearily  to the ground where  his hands lay  feebly  <
line 42499=>ed him, till  night covered them both and hid them  from <
line 42500=>one another. He could no longer find any words to say;  and he turned to his <
line 42501=>r himself, though weary and under a  shadow of fear, <
line 42502=>he still  had some strength left. The lembas had a virtue without which they <
line 42503=>down to die. It did  not satisfy desire, and  at <
line 42504=>times Sam's mind  was filled with the memories of food, and the  longing for <
line 42505=>simple  bread  and meats.  And yet this waybread of the  Elves had a potency <
line 42506=>travellers  relied on it alone and did  not mingle it with <
line 42507=>other foods. It fed the will, and  it gave strength to endure, and to master  <
line 42508=>d the measure of mortal  kind. But  now a  new decision <
line 42509=>must be  made. They could not follow  this road any  longer; for  it went on <
line 42510=>0t Shadow, but the Mountain  now  loomed  upon their <
line 42511=>right, almost due south, and they must turn towards it. Yet  still before it <

line 42513=>ming, barren, ash-ridden land. ered  Sam.  He had  stinted  himself,  and in  his <
line 42514=>parched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his care they  <
line 42515=>now  had  very little left, perhaps half  his bottle, and  maybe there  were <
line 42516=>o.  All would long ago have been spent, if they had not dared <
line 42517=>to follow the  orc-road. For at long intervals on that highway  cisterns had <
line 42518=>beee use  of troops  sent in  haste  through  the  waterless <
line 42519=>ns. In one  Sam had found some water left, stale, muddied by  the orcs,  <
line 42520=>for their desperate case. Yet that was now a  day ago. <
line 42521=><
line 42522=>####-There was no hope of any more. <
line 42523=>more.    At last  wearied with his cares Sam drowsed, leaving the morrow till it <
line 42524=> more. Dream and waking mingled uneasily. He saw  <
line 42525=>lights <
line 42526=>like gloating yes, and dark creeping shapes, and he heard noises as of  wild <
line 42527=>l cries of tortured things; and he would start  up to <
line 42528=>find the world all dark and only  empty b lackness all about him. Once  only,  <
line 42529=>0ldly round,  did it seem that, though now awake, he <
line 42530=>could still see pale lights like eyes; but soon they flickered and vanished. <
line 42531=>d  slowly  and  reluctantly. Such  da ylight  as <
line 42532=>followed was dim; for here as the Mountain drew near the air was ever mirky, <
line 42533=>while  out  from the Dark Tower  there crept the veils of Shadow that Sauron <
line 42534=>. Frodo was lying on his back not moving. Sam stood <

line 42543=>a weight.'before he spoke, that  it was vain, and that  such words might <
line 42544=>do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not  keep silent. 'Then let <
line 42545=> for you, Master,' he said. 'You know I would, and gladly, <
line 42546=>as long as I have any strength. ' <
line 42547=> '     A wild light came  into Frodo's  eyes. 'Stand away! Don't touch me!' he <
line 42548=>  I say. Be off!' His hand strayed to his sword-hilt. But <
line 42549=>then quickly his voice changed.  'No, no,  Sam,' he said sadly.  'But you must  <

line 42553=>     Sam  nodded. 'I understand,'  he  said.  'But  I've been thinking,  Mr. <
line 42554=>we might do without. Why not lighten  the load a  <

line 42565=>things  in  his pack.  Somehow  each of them had become dear to him, if only <
line 42566=>because he had borne them so far with so much toil. Hardest of all it was to <
line 42567=>part with  his cooking-gear.  Tears welled in  his eyes  at  the thought  of <
line 42568=>you  remember that  bit  of  rabbit, Mr. Frodo?' he  said. 'And our <
line 42569=>n  Captain  Faramir's  country, the  day I saw an <
line 42570=>oliphaunt?' <
line 42571=>     'No, I  am afraid not,  Sam, '  said Frodo. 'At  least, I know that such <
line 42572=>0 but I cannot see them. No taste of food, no feel of water, <
line 42573=>no sound of wind,  no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or  <

line 42575=>between me  and  the wheel  of fire. I begin to see  it even  with my waking <

line 42577=>ssed his hand. 'Then the sooner we're rid of it, <
line 42578=>the sooner  to rest,'  he said  haltingly, finding no  better  words to say. <
line 42579=>'Talking won't mend nothing,' he muttered to himself,  as he gathered up all <
line 42580=>they had chosen to cast away. He was  not willing to leave <
line 42581=>them lying open in the wilderness  for any eyes  to see. 'Stinker picked  up <
line 42582=>ingly,  and he  isn't going to add a sword  to it. His <

line 42588=>to  serve his master  as a girdle and bind  the grey cloak close  about  his <

line 42594=>y turned  their faces to  the Mountain  and  set out, <
line 42595=>thinking no more of concealment,  bending  their weariness and failing wills <

line 42611=>. Sam gave him  a mouthful  of water; only one more mouthful <
line 42612=>remained. He went without himself; and now as once more the  night of <
line 42613=> through all his thoughts there came  the memory of water; <
line 42614=>and every brook  or  stream or fount  that he  had  ever  seen, under  green <
line 42615=>ling in  the sun, danced  and rippled for his  torment <
line 42616=>behind the blindness of his eyes. He felt the cool mud about his toes  as he <
line 42617=>ater with Jolly Cotton and Tom and Nibs, and their <
line 42618=>sister  Rosie. 'But that was years  ago,'  he sighed, 'and far away. The way <
line 42619=>st the Mountain.' <
line 42620=>     He could not sleep and he held a  debate with himself. 'Well, come now,  <
line 42621=>we've done better than you hoped,' he said sturdily.  'Began  well anyway. I <
line 42622=>ed half the distance before we stopped. One more day will do <
line 42623=>it.' And then he paused. <
line 42624=>     'Don't  be a  fool, Sam Gamgee,' came  an answer  in  his own voice. 'He <
line 42625=>won't go another day like that, if he moves at all. And you can't go on much  <

line 42627=>e water and most of the food.' a good way though, and I will.' <
line 42628=>To the Mountain, of course.' <
line 42629=>     'But what then, Sam Gamgee, what then? When you get there, what are you  <
line 42630=>'t be able to do anything for himself.' <
line 42631=>e to do anything for himself.' realized that he  had not  got an answer  to this. He <
line 42632=>had no clear idea  at all. Frodo  had not spoken much to him  of his errand, <
line 42633=>hat the Ring had somehow to be put into the fire. <
line 42634=>'The Cracks of  Doom,' he muttered, the old name rising  to his mind. 'Well, <
line 42635=>m, I don't.' <
line 42636=>e!' came the answer. 'It's  all quite useless.  He said so <
line 42637=>himself. You are the fool, going on hoping and  toiling. You could have lain <
line 42638=>  together days ago, if you hadn't been so dogged. But <
line 42639=>you'll die just the same, or worse. You might just as well lie down  now and <
line 42640=>et to the top anyway.' <
line 42641=>     'I'll get there, if  I leave everything but my bones behind,' said Sam. <
line 42642=>'And I'll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart. So stop <
line 42643=>arguing!' <
line 42644=>     At  that moment Sam felt a  tremor in the  ground  beneath  him, and he <
line 42645=>headeep remote rumble as  of  thunder  imprisoned  under the  <
line 42646=>earth. There was a brief  red flame that flickered under the clouds and died <
line 42647=> slept uneasily. <
line 42648=>     The last stage of their journey to  Orodruin came, and it was a torment <
line 42649=>greater than Sam had ever thought that he could bear. He was in pain, and so  <
line 42650=>parched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food. It remained <
line 42651=>dark, not  only because of the  smokes of the Mountain: there seemed to be a  <
line 42652=>storm  coming  up,  and  away  to  the  south-east there  was  a  shimmer of <
line 42653=>ings under the black skies. Worst of all,  the air  was full of fumes;  <
line 42654=>nd difficult, and  a dizziness  came on them, so that <
line 42655=>0gered and often fell. And  yet their wills did not  yield, and they <
line 42656=>untain crept  up ever nearer, until, if they  lifted their heavy <
line 42657=>ight, looming vast before them: a huge mass of <
line 42658=>st before them: a huge mass of d burned stone, out  of which a  sheer -sided cone was raised <
line 42659=>into  the clouds. Before the  daylong dusk ended and true  night  came again <
line 42660=>they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet. <
line 42661=>     With a gasp  Frodo cast  himself on  the ground. Sam sat by him. To his <
line 42662=>ed but lighter, and his head seemed clear again. No more <
line 42663=><
line 42664=>####-debates disturbed  his mind.  He knew all the arguments of despair and would <
line 42665=>. His wi ll was set, and only death would break it. He felt <
line 42666=>no longer either desire  or need of sleep, but  rather  of  watchfulness. He <
line 42667=>zards and perils were now  drawing together to a point: <
line 42668=>the next day would  be a day of doom, the day  of final  effort or disaster, <
line 42669=>0when  would it come? The night seemed endless and  timeless, minute <
line 42670=>after  minu and adding up to  no  passing hour,  bringing no <
line 42671=>change. Sam  began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and no day <
line 42672=>would <
line 42673=>roped  for  Frodo's  hand.  It  was  cold  and <
line 42674=>o's  hand.  It  was  cold  and aster was shivering. <
line 42675=>     'I  didn't ought  to have left  my blanket  behind,' muttered Sam;  and <
line 42676=>rt Frodo with his arms and body. Then sleep took  <
line 42677=>him,  and the dim light of  the last day of  their  quest found them side by <
line 42678=> day before  as it shifted from the West, and <
line 42679=> it shifted from the West, and  the North  and began  to rise; and slowly the light of the <
line 42680=>unseen Sun filtered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay. <
line 42681=>     'Now for it! Now  for the last  gasp!' said Sam as he  struggled to his <
line 42682=>feet.  He bent over Frodo, rousing  him gently.  Frodo groaned; but  with  a  <
line 42683=>great effort of will he staggered up; and then he fell upon his knees again.  <
line 42684=>th difficulty to the dark slopes of Mount Doom towering <
line 42685=>above him, and then pitifully he began to crawl forward on his hands.  <
line 42686=> in his heart, but  no tears came to his  dry <
line 42687=>but  no tears came to his  dry . 'I said I'd carry him, if it broke my back,' he muttered, <
line 42688=>'and I will!' <
line 42689=>     'Come, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I can't carry it for you, but I can carry <
line 42690=>d  it as well.  So  up you get! Come on, Mr. Frodo dear! Sam will give <
line 42691=>m where to go, and he'll go.' <
line 42692=>     As Frodo clung upon his back, arms loosely about his neck, legs clasped <
line 42693=>ms, Sam staggered to his  feet; and then to his amazement  <
line 42694=>he felt the  burden light. He had feared that he would  have barely strength <
line 42695=>lone, and beyond that he had expected to share in  the <
line 42696=>dreadful dragging weight of the  accursed  Ring.  But it was not so. Whether  <
line 42697=>0n by his  long pains, wound  of knife, and venomous <
line 42698=>sting,  and  sorrow, fear, and homeless wandering, or  because some  gift of <
line 42699=> him, Sam lifted Frodo with no more  difficulty <
line 42700=><
line 42701=>####-than if he were carrying a hobbit-child pig-a -back in some romp on the lawns <
line 42702=> He took a deep breath and started off. <
line 42703=>a deep breath and started off. he Mountain's foot on its northern side, and a little <
line 42704=>to the westward; there its long grey  slopes, though broken, were not sheer. <
line 42705=>so Sam  struggled on as best he could, having  no  <
line 42706=>guidance but the will to climb as high as might be  before his strength gave <
line 42707=> toiled, up and up, turning this way and  that <
line 42708=>up, turning this way and  that lope, often stumbling forward, and at the last crawling like <
line 42709=>a snail  with  a  heavy burden on its back. When his will could drive him no <
line 42710=>further, and his limbs gave way, he stopped and laid his master gently down.  <
line 42711=>Frodo opened his eyes and  drew a breath.  It was easier  to breathe up <
line 42712=>hat coiled and drifted down below. 'Thank you,  Sam,' <
line 42713=>0n a cracked whisper. 'How far is there to go?' <
line 42714=>ow,' said Sam, 'because I don't know where we're going.' <
line 42715=>     He looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to see how far <
line 42716=>ght him. The Mountain standing ominous and alone had <
line 42717=>looked taller than it was. Sam saw  now that it was less lofty than the high <
line 42718=>hich  he and Frodo had  scaled. The  confused and <
line 42719=>tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three thousand feet above  <
line 42720=>  reared half as  high again its  tall central <
line 42721=>  high again its  tall central t oast  or chimney capped with a jagged  crater. But already <
line 42722=>Sam was  more than half way up  the base, and the pla in of Gorgoroth was dim <
line 42723=>below him, wrapped in fume and shadow. As he looked up he would have <
line 42724=>ut. if his parched throat had allowed him; for amid the rugged humps  and <
line 42725=>e saw plainly a path or road.  It climbed like a rising <
line 42726=>from the west and wound snakelike about the Mountain, until before it <
line 42727=>0it reached the foot  of the  cone upon its  eastern <
line 42728=>side. <
line 42729=>     Sam could  not see  the course  immediately above  him,  where  it  was <
line 42730=>lowestope went up from where he stood; but  he  guessed that <
line 42731=>if he could only struggle on just a little way further up, they would strike <
line 42732=> returned to  him. They might conquer the Mountain <
line 42733=>yet. 'Why, it might have  been put there a -purpose!' he said to himself. 'If <
line 42734=>say I was beaten in the end.' <
line 42735=>     The path was not put there for the purposes of Sam. He did not know it, <
line 42736=>but he was looking at Sauron's Road  from Barad-dyr to the Sammath Naur, the <
line 42737=><
line 42738=>####-Chambers of Fire. Out from the Dark Tower's huge western gate it came over a  <
line 42739=>vast bridge of iron, and then passing  into the plain it ran <
line 42740=>for a league between  two smoking  chasms,  and so  reached  a  long sloping <
line 42741=> on to the Mountain's eastern side.  Thence, turning and  <
line 42742=>encircling all  its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high <
line 42743=>still far from the reeking summit, to a dark entrance <
line 42744=>that  gazed back  east  straight  to  the  Window  of  the  Eye  in Sauron's <
line 42745=>ten blocked  or destroyed by  the tumults  of the <
line 42746=>Mountain's furnaces, always  that road was repaired and cleaned again by the <
line 42747=>   Sam drew a deep breath. There was a path, but how he was to get  up the <
line 42748=>slopot know. First he must ease his aching back. He lay flat <
line 42749=>beside Frodo for a  while. Neither spoke. Slowly the light  grew. Suddenly a  <
line 42750=> he did not understand  came to Sam. It was almost as <
line 42751=>if he had been called: 'Now, now, or it will be too late!' He braced himself <
line 42752=>med to have felt  the  call. He struggled to  his <
line 42753=>knees. <
line 42754=>     'I'll crawl, Sam,' he gasped. <
line 42755=>ed.     So foot by foot, like small grey insects, they crept up the sl ope. They <
line 42756=>nd found  that it was broad, paved with broken rubble  and  <
line 42757=>beaten  ash.  Frodo clambered on  to  it,  and  then  moved  as  if by  some <
line 42758=>slowly to face  the East. Far off the shadows of Sauron <
line 42759=>hung; but  torn by some gust of wind out of the world, or else moved by some <
line 42760=>0the mantling  clouds swirled, and for a moment drew <
line 42761=>aside; and  then he saw,  rising  black,  blacker and  darker than  the vast  <
line 42762=>,  the  cruel pinnacles  and  iron  crown of the <
line 42763=>topmost tower of Barad-dyr. One moment  only it stared out, but as from some <
line 42764=>great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward  a  flame of red, the <
line 42765=>cing Eye;  and then the shadows were furled  again and the <
line 42766=>terrible vision was removed. The Eye was not  turned to them:  it was gazing <
line 42767=>tains of  the West  stood at bay, and thither  all its <
line 42768=>malice was now bent, as the Power moved to strike its deadly blow; but Frodo <
line 42769=>ell as  one stricken mortally. His hand sought the <
line 42770=>chain about his neck. <
line 42771=>m. Faint, almost  inaudibly, he heard Frodo whispering: <
line 42772=>'Help me, Sam! Help me, Sam! Hold  my hand! I can't  stop it.' Sam took  his <
line 42773=>master's hands a nd laid  them together, palm to  palm, and kissed them;  and  <
line 42774=><
line 42775=>####-then he held them gently  between his own. The thought came suddenly to him: <
line 42776=>'He'ss all  up, or it soon will be. Now, Sam Gamgee, this is <
line 42777=>the end of ends.' <
line 42778=>ed Frodo  and drew  his  hands down to  his  own breast. <
line 42779=>letting his master's legs  dangle. Then he bowed his  head and struggled off <
line 42780=>along the climbing road. It was  not as easy a way to take as it had  looked <
line 42781=>at first.  By fortune the fires that had poured  forth in the great  turmoils <
line 42782=> Ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern <
line 42783=>ed down mainly on the southern es,  and the road  on  this  side  was not blocked.  Yet in many <
line 42784=>r was crossed  by gaping rents. After climbing <
line 42785=>y gaping rents. After climbing e time it bent back upon itself at a sharp  angle  and  went <
line 42786=>westward fox  a space. There at the bend it  was  cut deep through a crag of <
line 42787=> once long  ago vomited  from the  Mountain's  furnaces. <
line 42788=>Panting under his load Sam turned the bend;  and even  as he did  so, out of <
line 42789=>he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag, <
line 42790=>like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as he passed. <
line 42791=>     A sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward, tearing the backs  of <
line 42792=>lasped his master's. Then  he knew what had  happened,  <
line 42793=>for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice. <
line 42794=> it hissed. 'Wicked masster cheats us; cheats Smjagol, <
line 42795=>gollum. He musstn't go that  wa y. He  musstn't hurt  Preciouss. Give  it  to <
line 42796=>0 us! Give it to uss!' <
line 42797=>     With a  violent heave Sam rose up.  At once  he drew his  sword; but he <
line 42798=>could do nothing.  Gollum and Frodo were locked together. Gollum was tearing <
line 42799=>at  his master,  trying to  get at the chain and the Ring. This was probably <
line 42800=> roused the dying embers of Frodo's heart and  <
line 42801=>g embers of Frodo's heart and  k,  an attempt to wrest his  treasure from him by force.  He <
line 42802=>fought back with a sudden  fury  that  amazed Sam, and Gollum  also. Even so <
line 42803=>gone far  otherwise,  if  Gollum  himself  had  remained <
line 42804=>unchanged;  but whatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he <
line 42805=> devouring desire and a terrible fear, they had left  <
line 42806=>grievous marks on him. He was a lean, starved, haggard thing, all  bones and <
line 42807=>wild light flamed in his eyes, but his malice was <
line 42808=>no longer matched by his old griping strength. Frodo flung him off and  rose <
line 42809=>n!' he gasped,  clutching his hand  to his  breast,  so that <
line 42810=><
line 42811=>####-beneath  the cover  of his  leather shirt  he clasped  the Ring.  'Down  you  <
line 42812=>creeping  thing,  and out of  my path!  Your time is at an  end.  You cannot <
line 42813=>  Then  suddenly, as  before under the eaves of the  Emyn Muil,  Sam  saw <
line 42814=>th other vision. A crouching shape, scarcely  more than <
line 42815=>the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet  <

line 42827=>his  sword. 'Quick, Master!' he gasped. 'Go on! Go on! No time to lose. I'll <
line 42828=>deal with him. Go on!' <
line 42829=>     Frodo looked at him as if at one now far away. 'Yes, I must  go on,' he <

line 42835=>     'Don't kill us,'  he wept. 'Don't hurt us with  na ssty cruel steel! Let <

line 42841=>times deserved;  and also it  seemed the  only safe thing to do. But deep in <
line 42842=> something that restrained him: he could not strike  this <
line 42843=>thing  lying  in the  dust, forlorn, ruinous,  utterly wretched. He himself, <
line 42844=>e while, had borne the Ring, and now dimly he guessed <
line 42845=>the  agony of  Gollum's  shrivelled  mind and body,  enslaved to tha t  Ring, <
line 42846=>e or relief ever in  life again. But Sam had no words to <
line 42847=>express what he felt. <
line 42848=> you, you stinking thing!' he said. 'Go away! Be off! I don't  <
line 42849=>trust you, not as far as I could kick you; but be off. Or I  shall hurt you, <
line 42850=>yes, with nasty cruel steel.' <
line 42851=>     Gollum got up on all fours, and backed away for several paces, and then <
line 42852=>he turned, and as  Sam aimed a kick at him  he fled away down the  path. Sam <
line 42853=>him. He suddenly remembered his master. He looked  <
line 42854=>up <
line 42855=>the  path and could not see him. As fast as he could he trudged up the road. <
line 42856=>might have seen  not  far below Gollum turn again, <
line 42857=>and then with a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes come,  swiftly but <
line 42858=>slinking shadow among the stones.  <
line 42859=>king shadow among the stones.  Soon  it bent again  and. with a  last  eastward <
line 42860=>course passed in a cutting along the face of the  cone  and came to the dark <
line 42861=>door in the Mountain's side, the door  of the  Samma th  Naur. Far  away  now <
line 42862=>rising  towards  the  South the  sun, piercing  the  smokes and haze, burned <
line 42863=>ominous, a dull  bleared  disc of red; but all Mordor lay about the Mountain  <
line 42864=>lent, shadow-folded, waiting for some dreadful stroke. <
line 42865=>     Sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in. It was dark and  hot, and a  <
line 42866=>0air.  'Frodo!  Master!'  he  called. There  was  no <
line 42867=>answer. For a  moment he stood, his heart beating with wild fears,  and then  <
line 42868=>owed him. <
line 42869=>d see nothing. In his great need he drew  out once more <
line 42870=>the phial of Galadriel, but it  was pale and cold in  his trembling hand and <
line 42871=>0 stifling  dark. He was come  to the  heart of  the <
line 42872=>realm  of  Sauron  and  the  forges  of  his   ancient  might,  greatest  in <
line 42873=>rs  were here  subdued. Fearfully he took a few <
line 42874=>uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a  flash of red <
line 42875=>that leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. Then Sam saw  that he was <
line 42876=>unnel that bored into the  Mountain's  smoking cone.  But <
line 42877=>only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by <
line 42878=> which the  red glare came, now leaping u p, now dying <
line 42879=>down  into  darkness; and all the while  far  below there was a rumour and a  <
line 42880=>0es throbbing and labouring. <
line 42881=>     The light sprang up  again, and there on the brink of the chasm, at the <
line 42882=>very Crack of Doom, stood Frodo,  black against the glare, tense, erect, but <

line 43205=> across his knees, but he wore no  helm. As they drew <

line 43208=>     Frodo  ran to meet  him, and Sam  followed close behind. 'Well, if that <

line 43216=>men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the <
line 43217=>em with great praise!' <
line 43218=>     And  when  the glad shout had swelled up and died away  again, to Sam's <
line 43219=>final and  complete satisfaction  and pure joy, a  minstrel of Gondor  stood <

line 43221=>####-forth, and knelt, and begged leave to sing. And behold! he said: <

line 43231=>and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all <
line 43232=>men  were hushed. And he  sang to them, now in the  Elven-tongue, now in the <
line 43233=>est,  until   their  hearts,  wounded  with  sweet  words, <
line 43234=>overflowed, and their joy was like swords, and they passed in thought out to <

line 43529=>     'Yes, we wait for the stroke of doom,' said Faramir.  And  they said no <
line 43530=> to them as  they stood upon the wall that the wind died,  <
line 43531=>and the light failed, and the Sun was bleared, and all sounds in the City or  <

line 43540=>t it  lightnings flickered; and then a tremor ran through the <
line 43541=>earth, and they felt the  walls of the City quiver. A sound like a sigh went <
line 43542=>ds about them; and their hearts beat suddenly again. <
line 43543=>     'It  reminds me of NÂ®menor,' said Faramir, and wondered to hear himself <

line 43557=>     And so they stood on the walls of the City of Gondor,  and a great wind <

line 43587=>riders from Cair  Andros of all  that  was done, and the City made ready for  <
line 43588=>the coming of the King. Merry was summoned and rode away with the wains <

line 44403=>tr to the  Silverlode  and to  their own  country.  They had <

line 44405=>Elrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their <
line 44406=>friends.  Often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep  they would sit <
line 44407=>rs, recalling  the ages that were gone and  all their <

line 44420=>farewell. <
line 44421=>and sighed: 'I wish I was going back to Lurien!' <
line 44422=>     At last one  evening  they came over  the  high moors, suddenly  as  to <
line 44423=>travellers it always seemed,  to  the brink of the  deep valley of Rivendell <
line 44424=>below the lamps  shining  in Elrond's house. And they went  down <

line 44441=>Sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of <
line 44442=>tures. At first he pretended to take some notes; but <
line 44443=>he often fell asleep; and when he  woke  he would  say:  'How splendid!  How <

line 44457=>to go. Yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him. He <

line 44459=>Only the night before he had said: <

line 44467=>answered; and he repeated it now to himself: 'Except the Sea.' <
line 44468=>     That  day  Frodo spoke to Elrond, and  it was  agreed  that they should <

line 44470=>too. At least as far as Bree. I want to see Butterbur.' <
line 44471=>     In  the evening  they went to say good-bye to Bilbo. 'Well, if you must  <
line 44472=>sorry.  I shall miss you.  It is nice just to <
line 44473=> miss you.  It is nice just to e about the  place. But I am getting very sleepy.' Then  he <
line 44474=>gave Frodo his mithril-coat  and Sting, forgetting that he had  already done <
line 44475=>so;  and  he gave him  also three books of lore that he had made  at various <
line 44476=> written  in  his spidery hand,  and labelled  on  their  red  backs: <

line 44481=>  good advice.'  And when he had given them a fair sample <
line 44482=>of  this, he added a last item in Shire-fashion:  'Don't let your heads  get <

line 44491=>up again he said: 'Now where were we? Yes, of course, g iving presents. Which <

line 44516=>he slept soundly. <
line 44517=>in the room,  and the  firelight  burned brighter; <
line 44518=>and they looked at Bilbo  as he slept and saw that his face was smiling. For  <
line 44519=>some time they sat in silence; and then Sam  looking round  at  the room and <
line 44520=>the shadows flickering on the walls, said softly: <
line 44521=>do, that he's done much writing while we've been <
line 44522=>away. He won't ever write our story now.' <
line 44523=> story now.'   At that  Bilbo opened an eye, almost as if he had heard. Then he roused <
line 44524=>am getting so  sleepy,' he said. 'And when I have  time <
line 44525=>to write, I only really like writing poetry. I wonder, Frodo my dear fellow,  <
line 44526=>mind  tidying things up a bit before you go? Collect <
line 44527=>all my notes and  papers, and my diary too, and  take them with you, if  you  <

line 44529=>all that.  Get Sam to help, and when you've knocked things into  shape, come <

line 44531=>     'Of course I'll do it!' said Frodo. 'And of course I'll come back soon: <

line 44535=>     'Thank  you, my dear fellow!' said Bilbo. 'That really is a  very great <
line 44536=>relief to my mind.' And with that he fell fast asleep again. <
line 44537=>     The next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave  of Bilbo  in his room, <
line 44538=>for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond  and all <
line 44539=>household. <
line 44540=>upon  the threshold, Elrond  wished him  a fair journey, <
line 44541=>and blessed him, and he said: <
line 44542=>     'I think,  Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you  <
line 44543=>come  very soon. For  about this time of the year, when the  leaves are gold <

line 44565=>Gandalf. <
line 44566=>     'I  fear it may be so with  mine,'  said Frodo. 'There is no real going <
line 44567=>back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall <

line 44571=>     By the end of the next day  the pain and  unease had passed, and  Frodo <
line 44572=>0 as if he did not remember the blackness of the day <
line 44573=>before. After that the journey went well,  and the days went quickly by; for  <
line 44574=>often they lingered in the fair  woodlands where <
line 44575=>the leaves were red  and yellow  in the  autumn  sun. At length they came to  <

line 44578=>not look towards the hill,  but rode through its shadow with  head bowed and <
line 44579=>cloak drawn close about him. That night the weather changed, and a wind came <

line 44689=>t of the  fight, I  mean. And that was after we <
line 44690=>showed them the gates and  pushed them out: before the year's end, that was; <

line 44693=>beyond Archet, and out  in the wilds north-away. It's like a  bit of the bad <
line 44694=>, I say. It  isn't safe  on the road and nobody goes <
line 44695=>far, and folk lock up  early. We have to keep watchers all round  the  fence <
line 44696=>gates at nights.' <
line 44697=>     'Well, no one troubled us,' said Pippin, 'and we came along slowly, and <
line 44698=>left all trouble behind us.' <
line 44699=>     'Ah, that you haven't, Master,  more's the pity,'  said Butterbur. 'But <
line 44700=> left  you a lone. They wouldn't go for  armed folk, with <
line 44701=>swords and helmets and  shields  and all. Make them think twice, that would. <
line 44702=>And I must say it put me aback a bit when I saw you.' <
line 44703=>     Then the hobbits suddenly realized  that people had looked at them with <
line 44704=> of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their <
line 44705=>gear.  They  themselves  had  become  so  used to warfare and  to  riding in <
line 44706=>s  that they had quite  forgotten that the bright mail <
line 44707=>peeping from  under their cloaks, and the helms of Gondor and the Mark,  and <
line 44708=>ir  shields,  would seem  outlandish in  their own <
line 44709=>country. And Gandalf, too, was now  riding on his tall grey  horse, all clad <
line 44710=>f blue and silver over all, and the long sword <
line 44711=>r over all, and the long sword  side. <
line 44712=>ll, and the long sword  side. Well,  well,'  he  said, 'if they are afraid of just <
line 44713=>five of us, then we have met worse enemies on our travels. But  at any  rate <
line 44714=>they will give you peace at night while we stay.' <
line 44715=>     'How long will that be?' said Butterbur.  'I'll  not deny we  should be <
line 44716=>glad to have you about for a bit. You see, we're not used to  such troubles; <
line 44717=>and  the  Rangers have all gone  away,  folk tell  me.  I don't  think we've <

line 44751=>     'Well,  that sounds more hopeful, I'll  allow,' said Butterbur. 'And it <

line 45262=>he exclaimed. 'The voice is right, and your face is  no worse  than  it was,  <
line 45263=>Sam. But  I should a' passed you in the street in that gear. You've been  in <
line 45264=>foreign parts, seemingly. We feared you were dead.' <
line 45265=>I ain't!'  said Sam.  'Nor Mr. Frodo. He's here and  his friends. <
line 45266=>And  that's  re raising the Shire. We're going to clear  out <
line 45267=> and their Chief too. We're starting now.' <
line 45268=>hief too. We're starting now.' ried Farmer Cotton.  'So  it's  begun at last! I've been <
line 45269=>itching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn't help. And I've had the <

line 45272=>0tton and Rosie?' said Sam. 'It  isn't safe  yet for  <
line 45273=>them to be left all alone.' <
line 45274=>     'My Nibs  is  with them. But you  can  go and help him,  if you  have a  <

line 45280=>     'It's  me!' shouted Sam  as he trotted up.  'Sam Gamgee! So  don't  try <
line 45281=>ay, I've a mail -shirt on me.' <
line 45282=>     He  jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. They stared at him <

line 45284=>     'Hullo, Sam!' said Rosie. 'Where've you been I They said you were dead;  <

line 45286=>You haven't hurried have you?' t,'  said Sam abashed. 'But I'm hurrying now. We're setting <
line 45287=>about the ruffians, and I've got to get back to Mr. Frodo. But I thought I'd <
line 45288=>ow Mrs. Cotton was keeping, and you, Rosie.' <
line 45289=> was keeping, and you, Rosie.' g nicely, thank you,' said Mrs. Cotton.  'Or should be, if <

line 45292=>Frodo all this while, what d'you want  to leave  him for, as soon  as things <
line 45293=>as  too much  for Sam. It  needed a  week's answer, or none.  He <
line 45294=>turned away and mounted his pony. But as he started off, Rosie  ran down the <
line 45295=>steps. <
line 45296=>     'I think you look fine, Sam,'  she  said. 'Go on now! But  take care of <
line 45297=>yourself, t back as soon as you have settled the ruffians!' <
line 45298=>     When  Sam  got back  he found the  whole village roused. Already, apart  <
line 45299=> than a hundred sturdy hobbits were  assembled <
line 45300=>sturdy hobbits were  assembled eavy  hammers, and  long knives, and stout staves: and a few <
line 45301=>had hunting-bows. More were still coming in from outlying farms. <
line 45302=>     Some of the village-folk had lit  a large fire, just to enliven things,  <
line 45303=>and also because it was one of the things forbidden by the Chief. It  burned <
line 45304=>bright as  night came on. Others at Merry's orders  were setting up barriers <
line 45305=>ch end of the  village. When  the Shirriffs  came up to <
line 45306=>the lower  one  they were  dumbfounded; but  as soon as they saw how  things <

line 45308=>others slunk away. <
line 45309=>d his friends by the  fire talking to old Tom Cotton, <
line 45310=>while an admiring crowd of Bywater folk stood round and stared. <
line 45311=>     'Well, what's the next move?' said Farmer Cotton. <
line 45312=>an't  say,'  said Frodo, 'until  I  know more. How  many  of these <
line 45313=>That's  hard  to tell,' said  Cotton. 'They moves  about and comes and <
line 45314=>  fifty of them  in their sheds up Hobbiton way; but <
line 45315=>they go out  from there roving round,  thieving  or "gathering" as they call <
line 45316=>ss  than a score  round the  Boss, as they names <
line 45317=>him. He's at Bag End, or was; but he don't go outside the rounds now. No one <
line 45318=>s seen him at all, in fact, for a week or two; but the Men  don't let no one <
line 45319=>obbiton's not their only place, is it?' said Pippin. <
line 45320=>     'No, more's the pity,' said Cotton. 'There's a  good few down south  in <
line 45321=> I hear; and some more lurking in the Woody <
line 45322=>some more lurking in the Woody heds at Waymeet.  And then there's  the Lockholes, as they call  <
line 45323=>'em:  the old  storage-tunnels  at  Michel Delving  that  they've made  into <
line 45324=>ose as stand up to  them. Still I  reckon there's  not above <
line 45325=>three hundred of  them in the Shire all told, and  maybe less. We can master  <
line 45326=>them, if we stick together.' <
line 45327=>     'Have they got any weapons?' asked Merry. <
line 45328=>pons?' asked Merry. 'Whips,  knives, and  clubs, enough for their dirty  work:  that's  all <
line 45329=>they've showed so far,' said Cotton. 'But I dare say they've got other gear, <
line 45330=>if it comes to fighting. Some have bows, anywa y. They've shot one or two  of <
line 45331=>ou are, Frodo!' said Merry. 'I knew we should have  to  fight. <
line 45332=>Well, they started the killing.' <
line 45333=>ll, they started the killing.' n. 'Leastways not the  shooting. Tooks started <
line 45334=>r dad Mr. Peregrin, he's never had no truck with this Lotho, <
line 45335=>not  from the beginning: said that if anyone was going to play the chief  at <
line 45336=>t would  be the right Thain of the Shire and no upstart. <
line 45337=>And when Lotho sent his Men they got no  change out of him. Tooks are lucky, <
line 45338=>oles in the Green Hills,  the Great  Smials and all, <
line 45339=>and the  ruffians can't come at 'em; and they won't let the ruffians come on <
line 45340=>oks hunt  'em. Tooks shot three for prowling and <
line 45341=>robbing.  After  that the  ruffians turned nastier. And they  keep  a pretty <
line 45342=>close watch on Tookland. No one gets in nor out of it now.' <
line 45343=>     'Good  for the  Tooks!' cried Pippin.  'But someone is going  to get in <
line 45344=>to the Smials. Anyone coming with me to Tuckborough?' <
line 45345=><
line 45346=>####-     Pippin rode off with half  a dozen lads on ponies.  'See you soon!'  he <
line 45347=>urteen miles or so over the fields. I'll bring you back  <
line 45348=>an army of Tooks in the morning.' Merry blew  a horn-call after them as they <
line 45349=>ing night. The people cheered. <
line 45350=>     'All the same,' said Frodo to all those who stood near, 'I wish for  no <
line 45351=>killing; not even of the ruffians, unless  it must be done, to  prevent them <
line 45352=>from hurting hobbits.' <
line 45353=>     'All right! '  said Merry.  'But  we shall be having  a visit  from  the <
line 45354=>I  think. They  won't come just to  talk things <
line 45355=>over.  We'll try to deal with them  neatly, but  we must be prepared for the <
line 45356=>worst. Now I've got a plan.' <
line 45357=>     'Very good,' said Frodo. 'You make the arrangements.' <
line 45358=>     Just  then  some hobbits, who had  been sent out towards Hobbiton, came <
line 45359=>running in. 'They're coming!' they said. 'A score or more. But two have gone  <
line 45360=>off west across country.' <
line 45361=>t, that'll be, ' said  Cotton,  'to fetch  more  of  the gang. <
line 45362=>Well, it's fifteen mile each way. We needn't trouble about them just yet.' <
line 45363=>off to  give orders. Farmer Cotton cleared  the  street, <
line 45364=>sending everyone indoors, except the  older  hobbits who  had weapons of some <
line 45365=> to wait. Soon they could hear loud  voices, and then  <
line 45366=>the  tramping  of heavy feet. Presently  a whole squad of the  ruffians came <
line 45367=>the barrier and laughed. They did not imagine that <
line 45368=>ther e  was anything in  this little  land  that would stand up to  twenty of <
line 45369=>e hobbits  opened the barrier and stood aside.  'Thank you!' the  Men <
line 45370=>jeered. 'bed before you're whipped.' Then they marched along <
line 45371=>the street  shouting: 'Put those lights out! Get indoors  and stay there! Or <
line 45372=>the Lockholes for  a year. Get in!  The Boss is <
line 45373=>losing his temper.' <
line 45374=>to their orders; but as the  ruffians passed, they <
line 45375=>closed in  qu ietly behind and followed them.  When the  Men reached the fire <
line 45376=>there was Farmer Cotton standing all alone warming his hands. <
line 45377=>     'Who  are   you,  and  what   d'you   think  you're  doing?'  said  the <
line 45378=><
line 45379=>m slowly. 'I was just going to ask you that,' <
line 45380=>s just going to ask you that,' n't your country, and you're not wanted.' <
line 45381=>nted  anyhow,' said the leader. 'We want you.  Take him <
line 45382=><
line 45383=>####-lads! Lockholes for him, and give him something to keep him quiet!' <
line 45384=>orward  and stopped short. There rose a  roar of <
line 45385=>voices all round them,  and suddenly  they were aware that Farmer Cotton was <
line 45386=>not  all  alone. They  were surrounded.  In  the dark  on  the  edge  of the <
line 45387=>ring  of hobbits  that had crept  up out  of  the shadows. <
line 45388=>There was nearly two hundred of them, all holding some weapon. <
line 45389=>     Merry stepped  forward. 'We have met before,' he  said  to  the leader, <
line 45390=>to come  back here. I warn you again: you are standing <
line 45391=>in  the  light and you are covered  by archers. If you lay a finger on  this <
line 45392=>, you will be  shot at once.  Lay down any weapons <
line 45393=>that you have!' <
line 45394=>d. He was trapped. But he was not scared, not now <
line 45395=>with a score of his fellows to  back  him.  He knew too little of hobbits to <
line 45396=>understand his peril.  Foolishly he  decided to  fight. It  would be easy to <
line 45397=>break out. <
line 45398=>     'At 'em lads!' he cried. 'Let 'em have it!' <
line 45399=>nife in his left hand and a  club in  the other he made a  <
line 45400=>rush  at the  ring, trying  to burst out back towards Hobbiton.  He aimed  a  <
line 45401=>who stood in his way.  He fell dead with four arrows in <
line 45402=>him: <
line 45403=>     That was enough for the others.  They gave in. Their weapons were taken  <
line 45404=>y were roped  together,  and marched  off to  an empty hut <
line 45405=>that they had built themselves, and there they were tied hand  and foot, and <
line 45406=> The dead leader was dragged off and buried. <
line 45407=>er was dragged off and buried.  too easy  after all, don't it?' said Cotton.  'I said  we <
line 45408=>could master them. But we needed a call. You came  back in the nick o' time, <
line 45409=>Mr. Merry.' <
line 45410=>     'There's more to be done still,' said Merry. 'If  you're  right in your <
line 45411=> with a tithe of them yet. But it's  dark now.  I <
line 45412=>think the  next stroke must  wait  until morning. Then  we must  call on the <
line 45413=>aid Sam.  'It's not much more than  six o'clock. And I <
line 45414=>want to see my gaffer. D'you know what's come of him, Mr. Cotton?' <
line 45415=>     'He's not too  well,  and not too bad, Sam,' said the farmer. 'They dug <
line 45416=>at  was a sad blow  to  him. He's in one of  them  new <
line 45417=>houses that  the Chief's Men  used to  build while  they still did any  work <

line 45422=>him with me, but that wasn't allowed.' <
line 45423=>llowed.'    'Thank'ee indeed, Mr. Cotton, and I'll never forget it,' said Sam. 'But <
line 45424=>hat Boss and that Sharkey, as they  spoke of, they might  <
line 45425=>do a mischief up there before the morning.' <
line 45426=>chief up there before the morning.' aid Cotton.  'Choose a  lad or two, and go and fetch <
line 45427=>him to my  house. You'll not have need to  go near the old  Hobbiton village <
line 45428=>over Water. My Jolly here will show you.' <
line 45429=>Jolly here will show you.' . Merry arranged for look -outs round the village and guards <
line 45430=>at  the barriers during  the  night. Then he and Frodo went off with  Farmer  <
line 45431=>th  the family in the warm kitchen, and the Cottons asked <
line 45432=>a  few polite  questions about  their travels,  but hardly  listened  to the <

line 45434=>rned with events in the Shire. h Pimple, as we call him,' said Farmer Cotton; 'and it <
line 45435=>began as soon as you'd  gone off, Mr. Frodo.  He'd funny  ideas had  Pimple. <
line 45436=>Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and  then order other folk about. <
line 45437=> out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him; <
line 45438=>more, though  where he got  the  money  was  a  <
line 45439=> and malt-houses and  inns,  and farms, and leaf-plantations.  <
line 45440=>He'd already bought Sandyman's mill before he came to Bag End, seemingly. <
line 45441=>arted with a lot of property in the Southfarthing which <
line 45442=>he had from his dad; and it seems he'd been selling a  lot o' the best leaf,  <
line 45443=>tly for a year or two.  But at the end o'  last year <
line 45444=>he began sending away  loads of  stuff,  not only leaf. Things  began to get <
line 45445=> too. Folk got angry, but  he had his answer.  A <
line 45446=>lot of Men, ruffians mostly,  came with great waggons, some to carry off the <
line 45447=>goods south-away,  and  others  to stay. And  more came.  And before we knew <
line 45448=> were planted here  and there all over the Shire, and were <
line 45449=>felling trees  and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just  as <
line 45450=>oods and damage was paid  for by Pimple; but soon they <
line 45451=>began lording it around and taking what they wanted. <
line 45452=>as a bit  of trouble,  but not  enough. Old Will the Mayor  <
line 45453=>set off for  Bag End to protest, but he never got there. Ruffians laid hands <
line 45454=>locked him up in a hole in Michel Delving, and there he <
line 45455=>is  now.  And after that, it  would bc soon after New Year,  there wasn't no <
line 45456=>0lled himself Chief Shirriff, or just Chief, and did <
line 45457=><
line 45458=>####-as  he liked; and  if anyone  got "uppish" as  they called it, they followed <
line 45459=>om bad to worse. There wasn't no smoke left, save for <
line 45460=>the Men;  and the  Chief didn't hold with beer, save for his Men, and closed <
line 45461=>ng except Rules got  shorter and  shorter, unless <
line 45462=>one could hide a bit  of one's own  when the ruffians  went  round gathering <
line 45463=>on": which meant  they got it  and we didn't, <
line 45464=>t  they got it  and we didn't, avings which you could have at the Shirriff-houses,  if you  <
line 45465=>could  stomach them.  All  very bad.  But since Sharkey came it's been plain  <
line 45466=>ruination.' <
line 45467=>     'Who is this Sharkey?'  said Merry. 'I heard  one of the ruffians speak <
line 45468=>est  ruffian o' the lot, seemingly,' answered  Cotton. 'It was <
line 45469=>about last harvest,  end o'  September maybe,  that  we first heard of  him. <
line 45470=>im, but he's up at Bag End; and he's the real Chief now, I  <
line 45471=>guess.  All the ruffians  do what he says; and what he says is mostly  hack, <
line 45472=>ow it s come to killing. There s  no longer even any bad <
line 45473=>sense in it. They cut down trees and let 'em lie, they burn houses and build <
line 45474=>dyman's mill now. Pimple  knocked it down almost as soon as he <
line 45475=>came to Bag End. Then he  brought in a lot o' dirty-looking Men  to  build a  <
line 45476=>0ll it full o' wheels and outlandish contraptions. Only that <
line 45477=>fool Ted was pleased by  that, and he works  there  cleaning  wheels for the <
line 45478=>s the  Miller and his own master.  Pimple's idea was to <
line 45479=>grind  more  and faster, or  so he said. He's got other mills  like  it. But <
line 45480=>0before you can grind; and there was no more for the <

line 45485=> lower Water  and it's getting wine. If they want to make the Shire into a desert,  they're <

line 45554=>     The ruffians  came tramping along  the  East Road, and  without halting <
line 45555=>turned up the Bywater Road,  which ran for  some way sloping up between <
line 45556=>ges on top. Round a bend,  about a  furlong from  the main <
line 45557=>road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them. <

line 45605=>     'Yes indeed; the  sooner the better,'  said  Merry.  'And don't be  too <

line 45615=>new mill in all its  frowning and  dirty ugliness:  a  great  brick building <
line 45616=>h  it  fouled  with  a  steaming  and  stinking <
line 45617=>overflow. All along the Bywater Road every tree had been felled. <

line 45627=>Speech. It was lying lopped and  dead in the field. As if this was the  last <
line 45628=>     A laugh put an end to them. There was a surly hobbit lounging over  the <
line 45629=>low wall of the  mill-yard. He was grimy -faced and  black -handed.  'Don't  'ee <
line 45630=>like it, Sam?'  he sneered. 'But  you always  was soft. I thought you'd gone  <

line 45641=>worse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.' <
line 45642=>and insolent, Sandyman,' said Merry. 'And also very much <

line 45647=>nd blew it loudly. <
line 45648=>     'Save your breath!' laughed Merry. 'I've a better.' Then lifting up his <
line 45649=>silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang  over the Hill; and out of <
line 45650=>heds and shabby houses of Hobbiton the hobbits answered, and <
line 45651=>came pouring out, and  with cheers and loud cries they followed  the company <
line 45652=>up the road to Bag End. <
line 45653=>     At the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends went <
line 45654=>on; and they came at  last to the once beloved place. The garden wa s full of <

line 45727=>in his  eyes of mingled wonder and  respect and  hatred.  'You  have  grown, <
line 45728=>you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel. <
line 45729=>You  have  robbed  my revenge of  sweetness,  and  now  I must go  hence  in <

line 45736=>     'Wormtongue!' called Frodo. 'You need not follow him. I know of no evil  <
line 45737=>yoe. You can  have rest and food here for a while, until you  <

line 45740=>Saruman turned.  'No evil?'  he  cackled. 'Oh no! Even when he sneaks out at <

line 45742=>Lotho is hiding? You know, don't you, Worm? Will you tell them?' <
line 45743=>     Wormtongue cowered down and whimpered: 'No, no!' <

line 45754=>at something snapped: suddenly up, drawing a hidden knife, and then with a snarl like a dog <
line 45755=>he sprang on Saruman's back, jerked his head back, cut his throat, and  with <
line 45756=>a yell  ran off  down the lane. Before Frodo could recover or  speak a word, <
line 45757=>hobbit-bows twanged and Wormtongue fell dead. <
line 45758=>nged and Wormtongue fell dead. y of those that stood by, about the  body of Saruman a grey <
line 45759=>mist gathered, and  rising slowly to a great height like smoke  from a fire, <
line 45760=>as a pale shrouded  figure it loomed over the Hill. For a moment it wavered,  <
line 45761=>looking to the West; but out of the West came a cold wind, and it bent away,  <
line 45762=>ed into nothing. <
line 45763=>     Frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it <
line 45764=>seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, <
line 45765=> face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. Lifting up <
line 45766=>the skirt  of the dirty cloak  that sprawled beside  it, he covered it over, <
line 45767=> 'And  that's  the end of that,'  said Sam. 'A nasty end,  and I  wish I <
line 45768=>needn'but it's a good riddance.' <
line 45769=>ce.'  'And the very last end of the War, I hope,' said Merry. <
line 45770=>     'I hope so,' said Frodo and sighed. 'The very last stroke. But to think  <

line 45779=>found was  poor Fredegar Bolger, Fatty no longer. He had been taken when the <

line 45787=>they rescued her  from a dark and narrow  cell. She insisted on hobbling out <

line 45789=>,  leaning on Frodo's arm but still clutching  her  <
line 45790=>hat she was quite touched, and drove away in tears. She had never <
line 45791=>re. But she was crushed  by the news of  Lotho's <
line 45792=>murder, and she would' not return to Bag End. She gave it back to Frodo, and <

line 45798=>     Old Will Whitfoot had been in the Lockholes longer than any, and though <
line 45799=>he had  perhaps  been treated  less harshly  than  some,  he needed a lot of <
line 45800=>feeding up before he could look the part of Mayor; so Frodo agreed to act as <
line 45801=>0tfoot was  in shape again. The  only  thing that he <
line 45802=>did as  Deputy Mayor was  to reduce the Shirriffs to  their proper functions <
line 45803=>ting  out the last remnant of  the ruffians was <
line 45804=>left to Merry and  Pippin,  and  it was soon done. The southern gangs, after  <
line 45805=>hearing the news of the Battle of  Bywater, fled out of the land and offered <
line 45806=>to the Thain. Before the Year's End the few survivors were <

line 45813=>the gaffers  and gammers.  Before Yule not a brick was left standing of  the <

line 45991=>for a long time now, of course,' he said a little wistfully. <

line 45993=>Mr. Frodo.' 'Of course not.  But never mind.  You can see me on my way.  Tell  Rose <

line 46001=>   In the next day or  two Frodo went through his papers and  his writings <

line 46062=>Galadriel sat upon a white palfrey  and  was robed all in glimmering  white,  <

line 46064=>light.  On  her  finger was Nenya, the ring wrought of mithril ,  that bore a  <
