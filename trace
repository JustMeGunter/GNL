line 1=>In this reprint several minor inaccuracies, most of them noted by readers, have been corrected. For example, the rune text now corresponds exactly with the runes on  Thror's  Map.  More  important  is  the  matter  of  Chapter  Five.  There  the  true  story  of  the  ending  of  the  Riddle  Game,  as  it  was  eventually  revealed  (under  pressure)  by Bilbo  to Gandalf,  is  now  given  according  to  the Red Book,  in  place  of  the  version  Bilbo  first  gave  to  his  friends,  and  actually  set  down  in  his  diary. This  departure  from  truth  on  the  part  of  a  most  honest  hobbit  was  a  portent  of great  significance.  It  does  not,  however,  concern  the  present  story,  and  those who in this edition make their first acquaintance with hobbit-lore need not troupe about it.  Its  explanation  lies in the history of the Ring, as it was set out in the chronicles of the Red Book of Westmarch, and is now told in The Lord of the Rings.

line 3=>A final note may be added, on a point raised by several students of  the  lore of 
line 4=>the  period.  On  Thror's  Map  is  written  Here  of  old  was  Thrain  King  under  the 
line 5=>Mountain;  yet  Thrain  was  the  son  of  Thror,  the  last  King  under  the  Mountain 
line 6=>before  the  coming  of  the  dragon.  The  Map,  however,  is  not  in  error.  Names  are 
line 7=>often  repeated  in  dynasties,  and  the  genealogies  show  that  a  distant  ancestor  of 
line 8=>Thror  was  referred  to,  Thrain  I,  a  fugitive  from  Moria,  who  first  discovered  the 
line 9=>Lonely Mountain, Erebor, and ruled there for a while, before his people moved on 
line 10=>to the remoter mountains of the North.

line 14=>An Unexpected Party
line 15=>
line 16=>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with 
line 17=>the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing 
line 18=>in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. 
line 19=>It  had  a  perfectly  round  door  like  a  porthole,  painted  green,  with  a  shiny 
line 20=>yellow  brass  knob  in  the  exact middle. The  door  opened  on  to  a  tube-shaped hall 
line 21=>like  a  tunnel:  a  very  comfortable  tunnel without  smoke, with  panelled walls,  and 
line 22=>floors  tiled  and  carpeted,  provided with  polished  chairs,  and  lots  and  lots of pegs 
line 23=>for  hats  and  coats - the hobbit was  fond of visitors. The  tunnel wound on  and on, 
line 24=>going  fairly  but  not  quite  straight  into  the  side  of  the  hill  -  The  Hill,  as  all  the 
line 25=>people for many miles round called  it - and many little round doors opened out of 
line 26=>it,  first  on  one  side  and  then  on  another.  No  going  upstairs  for  the  hobbit: 
line 27=>bedrooms,  bathrooms,  cellars,  pantries  (lots  of  these),  wardrobes  (he  had  whole 
line 28=>rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and 
line 29=>indeed  on  the  same  passage. The  best  rooms were  all  on  the  left-hand side (going 
line 30=>in),  for  these  were  the  only  ones  to  have  windows,  deep-set  round  windows 
line 31=>looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.  
line 32=>This  hobbit  was  a  very  well-to-do  hobbit,  and  his  name  was  Baggins.  The 
line 33=>Bagginses  had  lived  in  the  neighbourhood  of  The  Hill  for  time  out  of mind,  and 
line 34=>people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, 
line 35=>but  also  because  they  never had  any  adventures or did  anything unexpected: you 
line 36=>could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking 
line 37=>him. This  is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure,  found himself doing and 
line 38=>saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but 
line 39=>he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
line 40=>The  mother  of  our  particular  hobbit  …  what  is  a  hobbit?  I  suppose  hobbits 
line 41=>need  some description nowadays,  since  they have become  rare  and  shy of the Big 
line 42=>People,  as  they  call  us.  They  are  (or  were)  a  little  people,  about  half  our  height, 
line 43=>and  smaller  than  the  bearded Dwarves. Hobbits  have  no  beards. There  is  little  or 
line 44=>no  magic  about  them,  except  the  ordinary  everyday  sort  which  helps  them  to 
line 45=>disappear  quietly  and  quickly  when  large  stupid  folk  like  you  and  me  come 
line 46=>blundering  along,  making  a  noise  like  elephants  which  they  can  hear  a  mile  off. 
line 47=>They  are  inclined  to  be    at  in  the  stomach;  they  dress  in  bright  colours  (chiefly 
line 48=>
line 49=>####-green  and  yellow);  wear  no  shoes,  because  their  feet  grow  natural  leathery  soles 
line 50=>and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long 
line 51=>clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially 
line 52=>after  dinner,  which  they  have  twice  a  day when  they  can  get  it). Now  you  know 
line 53=>enough  to  go  on  with.  As  I  was  saying,  the  mother  of  this  hobbit  -  of  Bilbo 
line 54=>Baggins, that is  - was  the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of  the  three remarkable 
line 55=>daughters  of  the  Old  Took,  head  of  the  hobbits  who  lived  across  The Water,  the 
line 56=>small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that 
line 57=>long  ago  one  of  the  Took  ancestors  must  have  taken  a  fairy  wife.  That  was,  of 
line 58=>course,  absurd,  but  certainly  there  was  still  something  not  entirely  hobbit-like 
line 59=>about  them,  -  and  once  in  a while members  of  the  Took-clan would go and have 
line 60=>adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and  the  family hushed  it up; but  the  fact 
line 61=>remained  that  the  Tooks  were  not  as  respectable  as  the  Bagginses,  though  they 
line 62=>were undoubtedly richer. Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after 
line 63=>she  became  Mrs.  Bungo  Baggins.  Bungo,  that  was  Bilbo's  father,  built  the  most 
line 64=>luxurious  hobbit-hole  for  her  (and  partly  with  her  money)  that  was  to  be  found 
line 65=>either  under  The  Hill  or  over  The  Hill  or  across  The  Water,  and  there  they 
line 66=>remained  to  the  end  of  their  days.  Still  it  is  probable  that  Bilbo,  her  only  son, 
line 67=>although  he  looked  and  behaved  exactly  like  a  second  edition  of  his  solid  and 
line 68=>comfortable  father,  got  something  a  bit  queer  in  his makeup  from  the Took  side, 
line 69=>something  that  only  waited  for  a  chance  to  come  out.  The  chance  never  arrived, 
line 70=>until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in 
line 71=>the  beautiful  hobbit-hole  built  by  his  father,  which  I  have  just described  for you, 
line 72=>until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.  
line 73=>By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when 
line 74=>there  was  less  noise  and  more  green,  and  the  hobbits  were  still  numerous  and 
line 75=>prosperous,  and  Bilbo  Baggins  was  standing  at  his  door  after  breakfast  smoking 
line 76=>an  enormous  long  wooden  pipe  that  reached  nearly  down  to  his  woolly  toes 
line 77=>(neatly brushed)  - Gandalf  came  by. Gandalf!  If  you  had  heard  only  a  quarter  of 
line 78=>what  I  have  heard  about  him,  and  I  have  only  heard  very  little  of  all  there  is  to 
line 79=>hear,  you  would  be  prepared  for  any  sort  I  of  remarkable  tale.  Tales  and 
line 80=>adventures  sprouted  up  all  over  the  place  wherever  he  went,  in  the  most 
line 81=>extraordinary  fashion.  He  had  not  been  down  that  way  under  The  Hill  for  ages 
line 82=>and  ages,  not  since  his  friend  the  Old  Took  died,  in  fact,  and  the  hobbits  had 
line 83=>almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across 
line 84=>The  Water  on  business  of  his  own  since  they  were  all  small  hobbit-boys  and 
line 85=>hobbit-girls. 
line 86=>
line 87=>####-All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. 
line 88=>He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white 
line 89=>beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots. 
line 90=>"Good  morning!"  said  Bilbo,  and  he  meant  it.  The  sun  was  shining,  and  the 
line 91=>grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows 
line 92=>that  stuck  out  further  than  the  brim  of  his  shady  hat.  "What  do  you  mean?"  be 
line 93=>said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether 
line 94=>I  want  not;  or  that  you  feel  good  this  morning;  or  that  it  is  morning  to  be  good 
line 95=>on?" 
line 96=>"All  of  them  at  once,"  said  Bilbo.  "And  a  very  fine  morning  for  a  pipe  of 
line 97=>tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down  and 
line 98=>have  a  fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have  all  the day before us!" Then Bilbo 
line 99=>sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring 
line 100=>of  smoke  that  sailed  up  into  the  air without  breaking  and  floated  away  over  The 
line 101=>Hill. 
line 102=>"Very  pretty!"  said  Gandalf.  "But  I  have  no  time  to  blow  smoke-rings  this 
line 103=>morning.  I  am  looking  for  someone  to  share  in  an  adventure  that  I  am  arranging, 
line 104=>and it's very difficult to find anyone." 
line 105=>«I should think so  - in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for 
line 106=>adventures.  Nasty  .disturbing  uncomfortable  things! Make  you  late  for  dinner!  I 
line 107=>can’t  think  what  anybody  sees  in  them,»  said  our  Mr.  Baggins,  and  stuck  one 
line 108=>thumb  behind  his  braces,  and  blew  out  another  even  bigger  smoke-ring. Then he 
line 109=>took out his morning  letters, and begin  to  read, pretending  to  take no more notice 
line 110=>of  the old man. He had decided  that he was not quite his  sort,  and wanted him  to 
line 111=>go away. But  the old man did not move. He stood  leaning on his stick and gazing 
line 112=>at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even 
line 113=>a little cross. 
line 114=>"Good  morning!"  he  said  at  last.  "We  don't  want  any  adventures  here,  thank 
line 115=>you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the 
line 116=>conversation was at an end. 
line 117=>"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you 
line 118=>mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off." 
line 119=>"Not  at  all,  not  at  all,  my  dear  sir!  Let  me  see,  I  don't  think  I  know  your 
line 120=>name?" 
line 121=>"Yes,  yes,  my  dear  sir  -  and  I  do  know  your  name, Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins.  And 
line 122=>you  do  know  my  name,  though  you  don't  remember  that  I  belong  to  it.  I  am 
line 123=>
line 124=>####-Gandalf,  and  Gandalf  means  me!  To  think  that  I  should  have  lived  to  be  good-
line 125=>morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!" 
line 126=>"Gandalf,  Gandalf!  Good  gracious  me!  Not  the  wandering  wizard  that  gave 
line 127=>Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came 
line 128=>undone  till  ordered?  Not  the  fellow  who  used  to  tell  such  wonderful  tales  at 
line 129=>parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and  the rescue of princesses and  the 
line 130=>unexpected  luck  of  widows'  sons?  Not  the  man  that  used  to  make  such 
line 131=>particularly  excellent  fireworks!  I  remember  those!  Old  Took  used  to  have  them 
line 132=>on  Midsummer's  Eve.  Splendid!  They  used  to  go  up  like  great  lilies  and 
line 133=>snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will 
line 134=>notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also 
line 135=>that  he was  very  fond  of  flowers. "Dear me!" she went on. "Not  the Gandalf who 
line 136=>was  responsible  for so many quiet  lads and  lasses going off  into  the Blue  for mad 
line 137=>adventures.  Anything  from  climbing  trees  to  visiting  Elves  -  or  sailing  in  ships, 
line 138=>sailing  to other  shores! Bless me,  life used  to be quite  inter  - I mean, you used  to 
line 139=>upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no 
line 140=>idea you were still in business." 
line 141=>"Where else  should  I be?"  said  the wizard.  "All  the  same  I am pleased  to  find 
line 142=>you  remember  something about me. You seem  to  remember my  fireworks kindly, 
line 143=>at any  rate,  land  that  is not without hope.  Indeed  for your old grand-father Took's 
line 144=>sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for." 
line 145=>"I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything!" 
line 146=>"Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as 
line 147=>to  send  you  on  this  adventure.  Very  amusing  for  me,  very  good  for  you  and 
line 148=>profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it." 
line 149=>"Sorry!  I  don't  want  any  adventures,  thank  you.  Not  today.  Good  morning! 
line 150=>But please come to tea - any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! 
line 151=>Good-bye!" 
line 152=>With  that  the hobbit  turned and  scuttled  inside his  round green door, and  shut 
line 153=>it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude. Wizards after all are wizards. 
line 154=>"What on earth did I ask him to tea for!" he said to him-self, as he went to the 
line 155=>pantry. He had only  just had break  fast, but he  thought a cake or  two and a drink 
line 156=>of  something  would  do  him  good  after  his  fright.  Gandalf  in  the  meantime  was 
line 157=>still  standing  outside  the  door,  and  laughing  long  but  quietly.  After  a  while  he 
line 158=>stepped  up,  and  with  the  spike  of  his  staff  scratched  a  queer  sign  on  the  hobbit's 
line 159=>beautiful  green  front-door.  Then  he  strode  away,  just  about  the  time  when  Bilbo 
line 160=>
line 161=>####-was  finishing  his  second  cake  and  beginning  to  think  that  he  had  escape 
line 162=>adventures very well. 
line 163=>The  next  day  he  had  almost  forgotten  about  Gandalf  He  did  not  remember 
line 164=>things  very  well,  unless  he  put  them  down  on  his  Engagement  Tablet:  like  this: 
line 165=>Gandalf ’¥a Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the 
line 166=>kind. Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and 
line 167=>then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and 
line 168=>saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.  
line 169=>"I am so sorry  to keep you waiting!" he was going  to say, when he saw  that  it 
line 170=>was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, 
line 171=>and  very  bright  eyes  under  his  dark-green hood.  As  soon a  the door was opened, 
line 172=>he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected. 
line 173=>He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and "Dwalin at your service!" he 
line 174=>said with a low bow.  
line 175=>"Bilbo  Baggins  at  yours!"  said  the  hobbit,  too  surprised  to  ask  any  questions 
line 176=>for  the  moment.  When  the  silence  that  followed  had  become  uncomfortable,  he 
line 177=>added:  "I  am  just  about  to  take  tea;  pray  come  and  have  some with me." A  little 
line 178=>stiff  perhaps,  but  he  meant  it  kindly.  And  what  would  you  do,  if  an  uninvited 
line 179=>dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation? 
line 180=>They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, 
line 181=>when there came another even louder ring at the bell. 
line 182=>"Excuse me!" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door.  
line 183=>"So  you  have  got  here  at  last!" was what  he was  going  to  say  to Gandalf  this 
line 184=>time.  But  it  was  not  Gandalf.  Instead  there  was  a  very  old-looking  dwarf  on  the 
line 185=>step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the 
line 186=>door was open, just as if he had been invited. 
line 187=>"I  see  they  have  begun  to  arrive  already,"  he  said  when  he  caught  sight  of 
line 188=>Dwalin's  green  hood  hanging  up.  He  hung  his  red  one  next  to  it,  and  "Balin  at 
line 189=>your service!" he said with his hand on his breast. 
line 190=>"Thank  you!"  said  Bilbo with  a  gasp.  It was  not  the  correct  thing  to  say,  but 
line 191=>they have begun  to  arrive had  flustered him badly. He  liked visitors, but he  liked 
line 192=>to know  them before  they arrived, and he preferred  to ask  them himself. He had a 
line 193=>horrible  thought  that  the  cakes might  run  short,  and  then  he-as  the host: he knew 
line 194=>his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without. 
line 195=>"Come  along  in,  and  have  some  tea!"  he  managed  to  say  after  taking  a  deep 
line 196=>breath. 
line 197=>
line 198=>####-"A  little  beer  would  suit  me  better,  if  it  is  all  the  same  to  you, my  good  sir," 
line 199=>said  Balin  with  the  white  beard.  "But  I  don't  mind  some  cake-seed-cake,  if  you 
line 200=>have any." 
line 201=>"Lots!"  Bilbo  found  himself  answering,  to  his  own  surprise;  and  he  found 
line 202=>himself  scuttling  off,  too,  to  the  cellar  to  fill  a  pint  beer-mug, and to the pantry to 
line 203=>fetch  two  beautiful  round  seed-cakes  which  he  had  baked  that  afternoon  for  his 
line 204=>after-supper morsel. 
line 205=>When he got back Balin and Dwalin were  talking at  the  table  like old  friends 
line 206=>(as  a  matter  of  fact  they  were  brothers).  Bilbo  plumped  down  the  beer  and  the 
line 207=>cake  in  front  of  them, when  loud  came  a  ring  at  the  bell  again,  and  then  another 
line 208=>ring. 
line 209=>"Gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the passage. But 
line 210=>it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow 
line 211=>beards;  and  each  of  them  carried  a  bag  of  tools  and  a  spade.  In  they  hopped,  as 
line 212=>soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. 
line 213=>"What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your service!" said the 
line 214=>one.  "And  Fili!"  added  the  other;  and  they  both  swept  off  their  blue  hoods  and 
line 215=>bowed. 
line 216=>"At  yours  and  your  family's!"  replied  Bilbo,  remembering  his  manners  this 
line 217=>time. 
line 218=>"Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!" 
line 219=>"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit 
line 220=>down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." He had only just had a 
line 221=>sip-in  the  corner,  while  the  four  dwarves  sat  around  the  table,  and  talked  about 
line 222=>mines  and  gold  and  troubles  with  the  goblins,  and  the  depredations  of  dragons, 
line 223=>and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they 
line 224=>sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, 
line 225=>as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at 
line 226=>the  door!"  he  said,  blinking.  "Some  four,  I  should  say  by  the  sound,"  said  Fili. 
line 227=>"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance." 
line 228=>The  poor  little  hobbit  sat  down  in  the  hall  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and 
line 229=>wondered  what  had  happened,  and  what  was  going  to  happen,  and  whether  they 
line 230=>would all stay  to supper. Then  the bell rang again  louder  than ever, and he had  to 
line 231=>run  to  the  door.  It  was  not  four  after  all,  t  was  FIVE.  Another  dwarf  had  come 
line 232=>along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re 
line 233=>they were all  inside, bowing and  saying  "at your  service" one after another. Dori, 
line 234=>Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  their  names;  and  very  soon  two  purple  hoods,  a 
line 235=>
line 236=>####-grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they 
line 237=>marched  with  their  broad  hands  stuck  in  their  gold  and  silver  belts  to  join  the 
line 238=>others. Already  it had almost become a  throng. Some called  for ale, and some  for 
line 239=>porter,  and  one  for  coffee,  and  all  of  them  for  cakes;  so  the hobbit was kept very 
line 240=>busy for a while. 
line 241=>A  big  jug  of  coffee  bad  just  been  set  in  the  hearth,  the  seed-cakes were gone, 
line 242=>and  the  dwarves  were  starting  on  a  round  of  buttered  scones,  when  there  came-a 
line 243=>loud  knock.  Not  a  ring,  but  a  hard  rat-tat  on  the  hobbit's  beautiful  green  door. 
line 244=>Somebody was banging with a stick! 
line 245=>Bilbo  rushed  along  the  passage,  very  angry,  and  altogether  bewildered  and 
line 246=>bewuthered-this  was  the  most  awkward  Wednesday  he  ever  remembered.  He 
line 247=>pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More 
line 248=>dwarves,  four  more!  And  there  was  Gandalf  behind,  leaning  on  his  staff  and 
line 249=>laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, 
line 250=>knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. 
line 251=>"Carefully!  Carefully!"  he  said.  "It  is  not  like  you,  Bilbo,  to  keep  friends 
line 252=>waiting  on  the  mat,  and  then  open  the  door  like  a  pop-gun!  Let  me  introduce 
line 253=>Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!" 
line 254=>"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they 
line 255=>hung  up  two  yellow  hoods  and  a  pale  green  one;  and  also  a  sky-blue one with  a 
line 256=>long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in 
line 257=>fact  no  other  than  the  great  Thorin  Oakenshield  himself,  who  was  not  at  all 
line 258=>pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. 
line 259=>For  one  thing  Bombur  was  immensely  fat  and  heavy.  Thorin  indeed  was  very 
line 260=>haughty,  and  said  nothing  about  service;  but  poor Mr. Baggins  said  he was  sorry 
line 261=>so  many  times,  that  at  last  he  grunted  "pray  don't  mention  it,"  and  stopped 
line 262=>frowning. 
line 263=>"Now we  are  all here!"  said Gandalf,  looking  at  the  row of  thirteen hoods-the 
line 264=>best  detachable  party  hoods-and his own hat hanging on  the pegs. "Quite a merry 
line 265=>gathering! 
line 266=>I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? 
line 267=>Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said Thorin. 
line 268=>"And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and cheese," said 
line 269=>Bofur.  "And  pork-pie  and  salad,"  said  Bombur.  "And  more  cakes-and  ale-and 
line 270=>coffee, if you don't mind," called the other dwarves through the door.  
line 271=>
line 272=>####-"Put  on  a  few  eggs,  there's  a  good  fellow!"  Gandalf  called  after  him,  as  the 
line 273=>hobbit  stumped  off  to  the  pantries.  "And  just  bring  out  the  cold  chicken  and 
line 274=>pickles!" 
line 275=>"Seems  to  know  as  much  about  the  inside  of  my  larders  as  I  do  myself!" 
line 276=>thought Mr. Baggins, who was  feeling  positively  flummoxed,  and was  beginning 
line 277=>to wonder whether  a most wretched  adventure  had  not  come  right  into his house. 
line 278=>By  the  time he had got all  the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses 
line 279=>and  plates  and  spoons  and  things  piled  up  on  big  trays,  he  was  getting  very  hot, 
line 280=>and red in the face, and annoyed. 
line 281=>"Confusticate  and  bebother  these  dwarves!"  he  said  aloud.  "Why  don't  they 
line 282=>come and lend a hand?" Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door 
line 283=>of  the  kitchen,  and  Fili  and Kili  behind  them,  and  before  he  could  say  knife  they 
line 284=>had  whisked  the  trays  and  a  couple  of  small  tables  into  the  parlour  and  set  out 
line 285=>everything afresh. 
line 286=>Gandalf  sat  at  the  head  of  the  party with  the  thirteen,  dwarves  all  round:  and 
line 287=>Bilbo  sat  on  a  stool  at  the  fireside,  nibbling  at  a  biscuit  (his  appetite  was  quite 
line 288=>taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly  ordinary and. not in the 
line 289=>least  an  adventure. The  dwarves  ate  and  ate,  and  talked  and  talked,  and  time  got 
line 290=>on.  At  last  they  pushed  their  chairs  back,  and  Bilbo  made  a  move  to  collect  the 
line 291=>plates and glasses. 
line 292=>"I suppose you will all stay to supper?" he said in his politest unpressing tones. 
line 293=>"Of  course!"  said Thorin.  "And  after. We  shan't  get  through  the  business  till  late, 
line 294=>and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!" 
line 295=>Thereupon  the  twelve  dwarves-not  Thorin,  he  was  too  important,  and  stayed 
line 296=>talking  to  Gandalf-jumped  to  their  feet  and  made  tall  piles  of  all  the  things.  Off 
line 297=>they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on 
line 298=>the  top,  with  one  hand,  while  the  hobbit  ran  after  them  almost  squeaking  with 
line 299=>fright:  "please  be  careful!"  and  "please,  don't  trouble!  I  can  manage."  But  the 
line 300=>dwarves only started to sing: 
line 301=> 
line 302=>
line 303=>Chip the glasses and crack the plates! 
line 304=>Blunt the knives and bend the forks! 
line 305=>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates- 
line 306=>Smash the bottles and burn the corks! 
line 307=> 
line 308=>Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! 
line 309=>Pour the milk on the pantry floor! 
line 310=>Leave the bones on the bedroom mat! 
line 311=>
line 312=>####-Splash the wine on every door! 
line 313=> 
line 314=>Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl; 
line 315=>Pound them up with a thumping pole; 
line 316=>And when you've finished, if any are whole, 
line 317=>Send them down the hall to roll ! 
line 318=> 
line 319=>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates! 
line 320=>So, carefully! carefully with the plates! 
line 321=>
line 322=> 
line 323=>And  of  course  they  did  none  of  these  dreadful  things,  and  everything  was 
line 324=>cleaned  and  put  away  safe  as  quick  as  lightning,  while  the  hobbit  was  turning 
line 325=>round  and  round  in  the middle of  the kitchen  trying  to  see what  they were doing. 
line 326=>Then  they  went  back,  and  found  Thorin  with  his  feet  on  the  fender  smoking  a 
line 327=>pipe. He was  blowing  the most  enormous  smoke-rings, and wherever he  told one 
line 328=>to  go,  it  went-up  the  chimney,  or  behind  the  clock  on  the  man-telpiece,  or  under 
line 329=>the  table,  or  round  and  round  the  ceiling;  but  wherever  it  went  it  was  not  quick 
line 330=>enough  to escape Gandalf. Pop! he  sent a  smaller  smoke-ring from his short clay-
line 331=>pipe  straight  through  each  one  of  Thorin's.  The  Gandalf's  smoke-ring  would  go 
line 332=>green  and  come  back  to  hover  over  the  wizard's  head.  He  had  quite  a  cloud  of 
line 333=>them  about  him  already,  and  in  the  dim  light  it  made  him  look  strange  and 
line 334=>sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched-he loved smoke-rings-and then be blushed 
line 335=>to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent 
line 336=>up the wind over The Hill. 
line 337=>"Now for some music!" said Thorin. "Bring out the instruments!" 
line 338=>Kili  and  Fili  rushed  for  their  bags  and  brought  back  little  fiddles; Dori, Nori, 
line 339=>and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a 
line 340=>drum  from  the  hall; Bifur  and Bofur went  out  too,  and  came  back with  clarinets 
line 341=>that they had left among the walking-sticks Dwalin and Balin said: "Excuse me, I 
line 342=>left  mine  in  the  porch!"  "Just  bring  mine  in  with  you,"  said  Thorin.  They  came 
line 343=>back with  viols  as  big  as  themselves,  and with  Thorin’s  harp wrapped  in  a  green 
line 344=>cloth.  It was  a  beautiful  gold-en harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began 
line 345=>all  at  once,  so  sudden  and  sweet  that Bilbo  forgot everything else, and was  swept 
line 346=>away  into dark  lands under  strange moons,  far over The Water and very  far  from 
line 347=>his hobbit-hole under The Hill. 
line 348=>The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of 
line 349=>The  Hill;  the  firelight  flickered-it  was  April-and  still  they  played  on,  while  the 
line 350=>shadow of Gandalf's beard wagged against the wall. 
line 351=>
line 352=>####-The  dark  filled  all  the  room,  and  the  fire  died  down,  and  the  shadows  were 
line 353=>lost,  and  still  they  played  on.  And  suddenly  first  one  and  then  another  began  to 
line 354=>sing  as  they  played,  deep-throated  singing  of  the  dwarves  in  the  deep  places  of 
line 355=>their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their 
line 356=>song without their music. 
line 357=> 
line 358=>
line 359=>Far over the misty mountains cold 
line 360=>To dungeons deep and caverns old 
line 361=>We must away ere break of day 
line 362=>To seek the pale enchanted gold. 
line 363=> 
line 364=>The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, 
line 365=>While hammers fell like ringing bells 
line 366=>In places deep, where dark things sleep, 
line 367=>In hollow halls beneath the fells. 
line 368=> 
line 369=>For ancient king and elvish lord  
line 370=>There many a gloaming golden hoard  
line 371=>They shaped and wrought, and light they caught 
line 372=>To hide in gems on hilt of sword. 
line 373=> 
line 374=>On silver necklaces they strung 
line 375=>The flowering stars, on crowns they hung 
line 376=>The dragon-fire, in twisted wire  
line 377=>They meshed the light of moon and sun. 
line 378=> 
line 379=>Far over the misty mountains cold 
line 380=>To dungeons deep and caverns old 
line 381=>We must away, ere break of day,  
line 382=>To claim our long-forgotten gold. 
line 383=> 
line 384=>Goblets they carved there for themselves 
line 385=>And harps of gold; where no man delves 
line 386=>There lay they long, and many a song 
line 387=>Was sung unheard by men or elves. 
line 388=> 
line 389=>The pines were roaring on the height, 
line 390=>The winds were moaning in the night. 
line 391=>The fire was red, it flaming spread; 
line 392=>The trees like torches biased with light, 
line 393=> 
line 394=>The bells were ringing in the dale 
line 395=>And men looked up with faces pale; 
line 396=>
line 397=>####-The dragon's ire more fierce than fire  
line 398=>Laid low their towers and houses frail. 
line 399=> 
line 400=>The mountain smoked beneath the moon; 
line 401=>The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom. 
line 402=>They fled their hall to dying -fall 
line 403=>Beneath his feet, beneath the moon. 
line 404=> 
line 405=>Far over the misty mountains grim 
line 406=>To dungeons deep and caverns dim 
line 407=>We must away, ere break of day,  
line 408=>To win our harps and gold from him! 
line 409=>
line 410=> 
line 411=>As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by 
line 412=>cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of 
line 413=>the  hearts  of  dwarves.  Then  something  Tookish  woke  up  inside  him,  and  he 
line 414=>wished  to  go  and  see  the  great  mountains,  and  hear  the  pine-trees  and  the 
line 415=>waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He 
line 416=>looked  out  of  the  window.  The  stars  were  out  in  a  dark  sky  above  the  trees.  He 
line 417=>thought  of  the  jewels  of  the  dwarves  shining  in  dark  caverns.  Suddenly  in  the 
line 418=>wood  beyond  The  Water  a  flame  leapt  up--probably  somebody  lighting  a  wood-
line 419=>fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it 
line 420=>all  to  flames. He  shuddered;  and  very  quickly  he was  plain Mr.  Baggins  of  Bag-
line 421=>End, Under-Hill, again. 
line 422=>He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more 
line 423=>than  half  a  mind  to  pretend  to,  and  go  and  hide  behind  the  beer  barrels  in  the 
line 424=>cellar,  and  not  come  out  again  until  all  the  dwarves  had  gone  away. Suddenly  he 
line 425=>found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him 
line 426=>with eyes shining in the dark. 
line 427=>"Where  are  you  going?"  said  Thorin,  in  a  tone  that  seemed  to  show  that  he 
line 428=>guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind. 
line 429=>"What about a little light?" said Bilbo apologetically.  
line 430=>"We like the dark," said the dwarves. "Dark for dark business! There are many 
line 431=>hours before dawn." 
line 432=>"Of  course!"  said Bilbo,  and  sat down  in  a hurry. He missed  the  stool  and  sat 
line 433=>in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. 
line 434=>"Hush!" said Gandalf. "Let Thorin speak!" And this is bow Thorin began. 
line 435=>"Gandalf,  dwarves  and Mr. Baggins! We  are  not  together  in  the  house  of  our 
line 436=>friend  and  fellow  conspirator,  this  most  excellent  and  audacious  hobbit-may  the 
line 437=>
line 438=>####-hair  on  his  toes  never  fall  out!  all  praise  to  his  wine  and  ale!-"  He  paused  for 
line 439=>breath  and  for  a  polite  remark  from  the  hob-bit,  but  the  compliments were  quite 
line 440=>lost on-poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called 
line 441=>audacious  and worst  of  all  fellow  conspirator,  though  no  noise  came  out,  he was 
line 442=>so flummoxed. So Thorin went on: 
line 443=>"We  are  met  to  discuss  our  plans,  our  ways,  means,  policy  and  devices.  We 
line 444=>shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which 
line 445=>some  of  us,  or  perhaps  all  of  us  (except  our  friend  and  counsellor,  the  ingenious 
line 446=>wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, 
line 447=>well known  to us all. To  the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps  to one or  two of 
line 448=>the  younger  dwarves  (I  think  I  should  be  right  in  naming  Kili  and  Fili,  for 
line 449=>instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation-" 
line 450=>This was  Thorin's  style. He was  an  important  dwarf.  If  he  had  been  allowed, 
line 451=>he  would  probably  have  gone  on  like  this  until  he  was  out  of  breath,  without 
line 452=>telling  any  one  there  'anything  that  was  not  known  already.  But  he  was  rudely 
line 453=>interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn't bear  it any  longer. At may never  return he began 
line 454=>to feel a shriek coming up  inside, and very soon  it burst out  like  the whistle of an 
line 455=>engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang Bp knocking over the table. 
line 456=>Gandalf struck a blue  light on  the end of his magic staff, and  in  its firework glare 
line 457=>the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly 
line 458=>that was melting. Then he fell flat on  the floor, and kept on calling out  "struck by 
line 459=>lightning,  struck  by  lightning!"  over  and  over  again;  and  that  was  all  they  could 
line 460=>get  out  of  him  for  a  long  time.  So  they  took  him  and  laid  him  out  of  the way  on 
line 461=>the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark 
line 462=>business. 
line 463=>"Excitable  little  fellow,"  said  Gandalf,  as  they  sat  down  again.  "Gets  funny 
line 464=>queer  fits,  but  he  is  one  of  the  best,  one  of  the  best-as  fierce  as  a  dragon  in  a 
line 465=>pinch." 
line 466=>If  you  have  ever  seen  a  dragon  in  a  pinch,  you will  realize  that  this was  only 
line 467=>poetical  exaggeration  applied  to  any  hobbit,  even  to Old Took's  great-granduncle 
line 468=>Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit)  that he could ride a horse. He charged 
line 469=>the  ranks  of  the  goblins  of  Mount  Gram  in  the  Battle  of  the  Green  Fields,  and 
line 470=>knocked  their  king  Gol-firnbul's  head  clean  off  with  a  wooden  club.  It  sailed  a 
line 471=>hundred  yards  through  the  air  and  went  down  a  rabbit  hole,  and  in  this  way  the 
line 472=>battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment. 
line 473=>In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the 
line 474=>drawing-room.  After  a  while  and  a  drink  he  crept  nervously  to  the  door  of  the 
line 475=>
line 476=>####-parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: "Humph!" (or some snort more or 
line 477=>less  like  that).  "Will  he  do,  do  you  think?  It  is  all  very  well  for Gandalf  to  talk 
line 478=>about  this hobbit being  fierce, but one  shriek  like  that  in a moment of excitement 
line 479=>would be enough  to wake  the dragon and all his  relatives, and kill  the  lot of us.  I 
line 480=>think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the 
line 481=>sign  on  the  door,  I  should  have  been  sure  we  had  come  to  the  wrong  house.  As 
line 482=>soon  as  I  clapped  eyes  on  the  little  fellow  bobbing  and  puffing  on  the mat,  I  had 
line 483=>my doubts. He looks more like a grocer-than a burglar!" 
line 484=>Then Mr. Baggins  turned  the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He 
line 485=>suddenly  felt  he would  go without  bed  and  breakfast  to  be  thought  fierce. As  for 
line 486=>little  fellow  bobbing  on  the  mat  it  almost  made  him  really  fierce.  Many  a  time 
line 487=>afterwards  the  Baggins  part  regretted  what  he  did  now,  and  he  said  to  himself: 
line 488=>"Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it." 
line 489=>"Pardon me," he said, "if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don't 
line 490=>pretend  to  understand  what  you  are  talking  about,  or  your  reference  to  burglars, 
line 491=>but  I  think  I  am  right  in  believing"  (this  is  what  he  called  being  on  his  dignity) 
line 492=>"that you  think  I am no good.  I will show you.  I have no signs on my door-it was 
line 493=>painted  a  week  ago-,  and  I  am quite  sure you have  come  to  the wrong house. As 
line 494=>soon as  I  saw  your  funny  faces  on  the  door-step,  I had my doubts. But  treat  it as 
line 495=>the right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from 
line 496=>here  to  the East of East and fight  the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I bad a 
line 497=>great-great-great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and —" 
line 498=>"Yes, yes, but  that was  long ago," said Gloin. "I was  talking about you. And I 
line 499=>assure  you  there  is  a  mark  on  this  door-the  usual  one  in  the  trade,  or used  to be. 
line 500=>Burglar  wants  a  good  job,  plenty  of  Excitement  and  reasonable  Reward,  that's 
line 501=>how  it  is  usually  read.  You  can  say  Expert  Treasure-hunter  instead of Burglar  if 
line 502=>you like. Some of them do. It's all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a 
line 503=>man of  the  sort  in  these parts  looking  for  a  Job  at once,  and  that he had arranged 
line 504=>for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time." 
line 505=>"Of course there is a mark," said Gandalf. "I put it there myself. For very good 
line 506=>reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose 
line 507=>Mr. Baggins.  Just  let  any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and 
line 508=>you can stop at  thirteen and have all  the bad  luck you  like, or go back  to digging 
line 509=>coal." 
line 510=>He  scowled  so  angrily  at Gloin  that  the  dwarf  huddled  back  in  his  chair;  and 
line 511=>when  Bilbo  tried  to  open  his  mouth  to  ask  a  question,  he  turned  and  frowned  at 
line 512=>him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. 
line 513=>
line 514=>####-"That's  right,"  said  Gandalf.  "Let's  have  no  more  argument.  I  have  chosen  Mr. 
line 515=>Baggins  and  that  ought  to  !6te  enough  for  all  of  you.  If  I  say  he  is  a  Burglar,  a 
line 516=>Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you 
line 517=>guess,  and  a  deal  more  than  he  has  any  idea  of  himself.  You  may  (possibly)  all 
line 518=>live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light 
line 519=>on this!" 
line 520=>On  the  table  in  the  light  of  a  big  lamp  with  a  red  shad  he  spread  a  piece  of 
line 521=>parchment rather like a map. 
line 522=>"This was made  by  Thror,  your  grandfather,  Thorin,  he  said  in  answer  to  the 
line 523=>dwarves' excited questions. "It is a plan of the Mountain." 
line 524=>"I  don't  see  that  this  will  help  us  much,"  said  Thorin  disappointedly  after  a 
line 525=>glance. "I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know 
line 526=>where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred." 
line 527=>"There  is  a dragon marked  in  red on  the Mountain,  said Balin,  "but  it will be 
line 528=>easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there." 
line 529=>"There  is one point  that you haven't noticed,"  said  the wizard,  "and  that  is  the 
line 530=>secret  entrance.  You  see  that  rune  on  the  West  side,  and  the  hand  pointing  to  it 
line 531=>from the other runes?** That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls. 
line 532=>"It may  have  been  secret  once,"  said  Thorin,  "but  how  do  we  know  that  it  is 
line 533=>secret  any  longer?  Old  Smaug  had  lived  there  long  enough  now  to  find  out 
line 534=>anything there is to know about those caves." 
line 535=>"He may-but he can't have used it for years and years. "Why?" 
line 536=>"Because  it  is  too  small.  'Five  feet  high  the  door  and  three may walk  abreast' 
line 537=>say  the  runes,  but  Smaug  could  not  creep  into  a  hole  that  size,  not even when he 
line 538=>was  a  young  dragon,  certainly  not  after  devouring  so  many  of  the  dwarves  and 
line 539=>men of Dale." 
line 540=>"It  seems  a  great  big  hole  to me,"  squeaked Bilbo  (who  had  no  experience  of 
line 541=>dragons  and  only  of  hobbit-holes) He was getting excited and  interested  again, so 
line 542=>that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a 
line 543=>large  one  of  the  Country  Round with  all  his  favourite walks marked  on  it  in  red 
line 544=>ink.  "How  could  such  a  large  door  be  kept  secret  from  everybody  outside,  apart 
line 545=>from the dragon?" he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember.  
line 546=>"In lots of ways," said Gandalf. "But in what way this one has been hidden we 
line 547=>don't  know  without  going  to  see.  From  what  it  says  on  the  map  I  should  guess 
line 548=>there  is  a  closed  door  which  has  been  made  to  look  exactly  like  the  side  of  the 
line 549=>
line 550=>                                                             
line 551=>** Look at the maps with this book, and you will see the runes there. 
line 552=>
line 553=> 
line 554=>
line 555=>####-Mountain. That is the usual dwarves' method- I think that is right, isn't it?" "Quite 
line 556=>right," said Thorin. 
line 557=>"Also," went on Gandalf, "I forgot  to mention  that with  the map went a key, a 
line 558=>small and curious key. Here it is!" he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long 
line 559=>barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. "Keep it safe!" 
line 560=>"Indeed  I  will,"  said  Thorin,  and  he  fastened  it  upon  a  fine  chain  that  hung 
line 561=>about his neck and under his jacket. "Now things begin to look more hopeful. This 
line 562=>news alters them much for-the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. 
line 563=>We  thought  of  going  East,  as  quiet  and  careful  as  we  could,  as  far  as  the  Long 
line 564=>Lake. After that the trouble would begin." 
line 565=>"A long time before that, if I know anything about the loads East," interrupted 
line 566=>Gandalf. 
line 567=>"We might go from there up along the River Running," went on Thorin taking 
line 568=>no  notice,  "and  so  to  the  ruins  of Dale-the old  town  in  the valley  there, under  the 
line 569=>shadow  of  the Mountain. But we  none of us liked the idea of the Front Gate. The 
line 570=>river  runs  right out of  it  through  the great  cliff  at  the South of  the Mountain,  and 
line 571=>out of it comes the dragon too-far too often, unless he has changed." 
line 572=>"That  would  be  no  good,"  said  the  wizard,  "not  without  a  mighty  Warrior, 
line 573=>even  a  Hero.  I  tried  to  find  one;  but  warriors  are  busy  fighting  one  another  in 
line 574=>distant  lands,  and  in  this  neighbourhood  heroes  are  scarce,  or  simply  lot  to  be 
line 575=>found.  Swords  in  these  parts  are  mostly  blunt,  and  axes  are  used  for  trees,  and 
line 576=>shields  as  cradles  or  dish-covers;  and  dragons  are  comfortably  far-off  (and 
line 577=>therefore  legendary).  That  is  why  I  settled  on  burglary-especially  when  I 
line 578=>remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the 
line 579=>burglar,  the  chosen  and  selected  burglar.  So  now  let's  get  on  and  make  some 
line 580=>plans." 
line 581=>"Very  well  then,"  said  Thorin,  "supposing  the  burglar-expert  gives  us  some 
line 582=>ideas or suggestions." He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. 
line 583=>"First  I  should  like  to  know  a  bit  more  about  things,"  said  he,  feeling  all 
line 584=>confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still lookishly determined to go on with 
line 585=>things.  "I mean  about  the  gold  and  the  dragon,  and  all  that,  and  how  it  got  there, 
line 586=>and who it belongs to, and so on and further." 
line 587=>"Bless  me!"  said  Thorin,  "haven't  you  got  a  map?  and  didn't  you  hear  our 
line 588=>song? and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?" 
line 589=>"All  the  same,  I  should  like  it  all plain  and  clear,"  said he obstinately, putting 
line 590=>on  his  business  manner  (usually  reserved  for  people  who  tried  to  borrow money 
line 591=>off him),  and doing his best  to  appear wise  and prudent  and professional  and  live 
line 592=>
line 593=>####-up  to Gandalf's  recommendation. "Also  I  should  like  to know about  risks, out-of-
line 594=>pocket  expenses,  time  required  and  remuneration,  and  so  forth"-by  which  he 
line 595=>meant: "What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?" 
line 596=>"O  very  well,"  said  Thorin.  "Long  ago  in  my  grandfather  Thror's  time  our 
line 597=>family  was  driven  out  of  the  far  North,  and  came  back  with  all  their  wealth  and 
line 598=>their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far ancestor, 
line 599=>Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls 
line 600=>and greater workshops  -and  in  addition  I  believe  they  found  a  good  deal  of  gold 
line 601=>and a great many  jewels  too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and 
line 602=>my  grandfather  was  King  under  the  Mountain  again  and  treated  with  great 
line 603=>reverence  by  the  mortal  men,  who  lived  to  the  South,  and  were  gradually 
line 604=>spreading  up  the  Running  River  as  far  as  the  valley  overshadowed  by  the 
line 605=>Mountain.  They  built  the merry  town  of  Dale  there  in  those  days.  Kings  used  to 
line 606=>send  for  our  smiths,  and  reward  even  the  least  skilful most  richly.  Fathers would 
line 607=>beg  us  to  take  their  sons  as  apprentices,  and  pay  us  handsomely,  especially  in 
line 608=>food-supplies, which we  never  bothered  to  grow  or  find  for  ourselves. Altogether 
line 609=>those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, 
line 610=>and leisure to make beautiful things just for the. fun of it, not to speak of the most 
line 611=>marvellous  and  magical  toys,  the  like  of  which  is  not  to  be  found  in  the  world 
line 612=>now-a-days.  So  my  grandfather's  halls  became  full  of  armour  and  jewels  and 
line 613=>carvings and cups, and the toy-market of Dale was the wonder of the North. 
line 614=>"Undoubtedly  that  was  what  brought  the  dragon.  Dragons  steal  gold  and 
line 615=>jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; 
line 616=>and  they  guard  their  plunder  as  long  as  they  live  (which  is  practically  forever, 
line 617=>unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly know 
line 618=>a  good  bit  of  work  from  a  bad,  though  they  usually  have  a  good  notion  of  the 
line 619=>current market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even mend a 
line 620=>little  loose  scale of  their armour. There were  lots of dragons  in  the North  in  those 
line 621=>days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south 
line 622=>or  getting  killed,  and  all  the  general  waste  and  destruction  that  dragons  make 
line 623=>going  from  bad  to  worse.  There  was  a  most  specially  greedy,  strong  and  wicked 
line 624=>worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we 
line 625=>heard of  it was a noise  like a hurricane coming from  the North, and  the pine-trees 
line 626=>on  the  Mountain  creaking  and  cracking  in  the  wind.  Some  of  the  dwarves  who 
line 627=>happened  to  be  outside  (I  was  one  luckily  -a  fine  adventurous  lad  in  those  days, 
line 628=>always wandering about, and it saved my life that day)-well, from a good way off 
line 629=>we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down 
line 630=>
line 631=>####-the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all 
line 632=>the bells were  ringing  in Dale and  the warriors were arming. The dwarves  rushed 
line 633=>out  of  their  great  gate;  but  there was  the  dragon waiting  for  them. None  escaped 
line 634=>that way.  The  river  rushed  up  in  steam  and  a  fog  fell  on Dale, and  in  the  fog  the 
line 635=>dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors-the usual unhappy story, 
line 636=>it was only too common in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the 
line 637=>Front  Gate  and  routed  out  all  the  halls,  and  lanes,  and  tunnels,  alleys,  cellars, 
line 638=>mansions  and passages. After  that  there were no dwarves  left  alive  inside,  and he 
line 639=>took  all  their  wealth  for  himself.  Probably,  for  that  is  the  dragons'  way,  he  has 
line 640=>piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to 
line 641=>crawl  out  of  the  great  gate  and  come  by  night  to  Dale,  and  carry  away  people, 
line 642=>especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone. 
line 643=>What goes on there now I don't know for certain, but I don't suppose anyone lives 
line 644=>nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days. 
line 645=>"The  few  of  us  that  were  well  outside  sat  and  wept  in  hiding,  and  cursed 
line 646=>Smaug;  and  there we were unexpectedly  joined by my  father  and my grandfather 
line 647=>with singed beards. They looked very grim but they said very little. When I asked 
line 648=>how  they had got away,  they  told me  to hold my  tongue, and said  that one day  in 
line 649=>the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had to earn 
line 650=>our  livings  as  best we  could  up  and  down  the  lands,  often enough sinking as  low 
line 651=>as  blacksmith-work  or  even  coalmining.  But  we  have  never  forgotten  our  stolen 
line 652=>treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not 
line 653=>so  badly  off"-here Thorin  stroked  the gold  chain  round his neck-"we still mean to 
line 654=>get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug-if we can. 
line 655=>"I  have  often  wondered  about  my  father's  and  my  grandfather's  escape.  I  see 
line 656=>now  they  must  have  had  a  private  Side-door  which  only  they  knew  about.  But 
line 657=>apparently  they made a map, and  I  should  like  to know how Gandalf got hold of 
line 658=>it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir." 
line 659=>"I did not 'get hold of it,' I was given it," said the wizard. 
line 660=>"Your grandfather Thror was killed, you  remember,  in  the mines of Moria by 
line 661=>Azog the Goblin —" 
line 662=>"Curse his name, yes," said Thorin. 
line 663=>"And  Thrain  your  father  went  away  on  the  twenty-first  of  April,  a  hundred 
line 664=>years ago last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since—" 
line 665=>"True, true," said Thorin. 
line 666=>"Well,  your  father  gave me  this  to  give  to  you;  and  if  I have  chosen my own 
line 667=>time and way of handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble 
line 668=>
line 669=>####-I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me 
line 670=>the  paper,  and  he  never  told  me  yours;  so  on  the  whole  I  think  I  ought  to  be 
line 671=>praised and thanked. Here it is," said he handing the map to Thorin. 
line 672=>"I don't understand," said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say the 
line 673=>same. The explanation did not seem to explain. 
line 674=>"Your  grandfather,"  said  the  wizard  slowly  and  grimly,  "gave  the map  to  his 
line 675=>son for safety before he went  to  the mines of Moria. Your father went away  to  try 
line 676=>his  luck with  the map after your grandfather was killed; and  lots of adventures of 
line 677=>a  most  unpleasant  sort  he  had,  but  he  never  got  near  the  Mountain. How  he  got 
line 678=>there  I  don't  know,  but  I  found  him  a  prisoner  in  the  dungeons  of  the 
line 679=>Necromancer." 
line 680=>"Whatever  were  you  doing  there?"  asked  Thorin  with  a  shudder,  and  all  the 
line 681=>dwarves shivered. 
line 682=>"Never  you  mind.  I  was  finding  things  out,  as  usual;  and  a  nasty  dangerous 
line 683=>business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but 
line 684=>it  was  too  late.  He  was  witless  and  wandering,  and  had  forgotten  almost 
line 685=>everything  except  the  map  and  the  key."  "We  have  long  ago  paid  the  goblins  of 
line 686=>Moria,"  said  Thorin;  "we  must  give  a  thought  to  the  Necromancer."  "Don't  be 
line 687=>absurd! He is an enemy quite beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if 
line 688=>they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing 
line 689=>your  father  wished  was  for  his  son  to  read  the map  and  use  the  key.  The  dragon 
line 690=>and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!" 
line 691=>"Hear, hear!" said Bilbo, and accidentally said  it aloud, "Hear what?"  they all 
line 692=>said  turning  suddenly  towards  him,  and  he  was  so  flustered  that  he  answered 
line 693=>"Hear what I have got to say!" "What's that?" they asked. 
line 694=>"Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round. After all 
line 695=>there  is  the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose. If you sit on 
line 696=>the  doorstep  long  enough,  I daresay you will  think of  something. And well, don't 
line 697=>you  know,  I  think  we  have  talked  long  enough  for  one  night,  if  you  see  what  I 
line 698=>mean.  What  about  bed,  and  an  early  start,  and  all  that?  I  will  give  you  a  good 
line 699=>breakfast before you go." 
line 700=>"Before  we  go,  I  suppose  you  mean,"  said  Thorin.  "Aren't  you  the  burglar? 
line 701=>And isn't sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the door? 
line 702=>But  I agree about bed and breakfast.  I  like eggs with my ham, when starting on a 
line 703=>journey: fried not poached, and mind you don't break 'em." 
line 704=>After  all  the  others  had  ordered  their  breakfasts  without  so  much  as  a  please 
line 705=>(which  annoyed  Bilbo  very much),  they  all  got  up.  The  hobbit  had  to  find  room 
line 706=>
line 707=>####-for  them  all,  and  filled  all  his  spare-rooms  and  made  beds  on  chairs  and  sofas, 
line 708=>before  he  got  them  all  stowed  and  went  to  his  own  little  bed  very  tired  and  not 
line 709=>altogether  happy. One  thing  he  did make  his mind  up  about was  not  to  bother  to 
line 710=>get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast. The Tookishness 
line 711=>was  wearing  off,  and  he  was  not  now  quite  so  sure  that  he  was  going  on  any 
line 712=>journey  in  the morning.  As  he  lay  in  bed  he  could  hear  Thorin  still  humming  to 
line 713=>himself in the best bedroom next to him: 
line 714=> 
line 715=>
line 716=>Far over the misty mountains cold  
line 717=>To dungeons deep and caverns old  
line 718=>We must away, ere break of day,  
line 719=>To find our long-forgotten gold. 
line 720=>
line 721=> 
line 722=>Bilbo went  to  sleep with  that  in  his  ears,  and  it  gave  him  very  uncomfortable 
line 723=>dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up. 
line 724=>
line 725=>####-Chapter 2
line 726=><br>
line 727=>Roast Mutton 
line 728=><br>
line 729=> 
line 730=>Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. 
line 731=>There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was 
line 732=>a  fearful  mess  in  the  room,  and  piles  of  unwashed  crocks  in  the  kitchen.  Nearly 
line 733=>every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The washing-up was so 
line 734=>dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not 
line 735=>been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved 
line 736=>after  all  to  think  that  they  had  all  gone  without  him,  and  without  bothering  to 
line 737=>wake him up ("but with never a thank-you" he thought); and yet in a way he could 
line 738=>not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling surprised him. 
line 739=>"Don't be a fool, Bilbo Baggins!" he said  to himself, "thinking of dragons  and 
line 740=>all  that  outlandish  nonsense  at  your  age!"  So  be  put  on  an  apron,  lit  fires,  boiled 
line 741=>water,  and  washed  up.  Then  he  had  a  nice  little  breakfast  in  the  kitchen  before 
line 742=>turning  out  the  dining-room. By  that  time  the sun was shining; and  the front door 
line 743=>was  open,  letting  in  a  warm  spring  breeze.  Bilbo  began  to  whistle  loudly  and  to 
line 744=>forget about the night before. In fact he was just sitting down to a nice little second 
line 745=>breakfast  in  the  dining-room by  the open window, when  in walked Gandalf.  "My 
line 746=>dear  fellow,"  said  he,  "whenever  are  you  going  to  come?  What  about  an  early 
line 747=>start?-and here you are having breakfast, or whatever you call  it, at half past  ten! 
line 748=>They left you the message, because they could not wait." 
line 749=>"What message?" said poor Mr. Baggins all in a fluster.  
line 750=>"Great Elephants!" said Gandalf, "you are not at all yourself this morning-you 
line 751=>have never dusted the mantel- piece!" 
line 752=>"What's  that  got  to  do  with  it?  I  have  had  enough  to  do  with  washing  up  for 
line 753=>fourteen!" 
line 754=>"If  you  had  dusted  the  mantelpiece  you  would  have  found  this  just under  the 
line 755=>clock,"  said  Gandalf,  handing  Bilbo  a  note  (written,  of  course,  on  his  own  note-
line 756=>paper). 
line 757=>This is what he read: 
line 758=> 
line 759=>
line 760=>"Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! 
line 761=>For  your  hospitality  our  sincerest  thanks,  and  for  your  offer  of 
line 762=>professional assistance our grateful acceptance. Terms: cash on delivery, up to 
line 763=>and  not  exceeding  one  fourteenth  of  total  profits  (if  any);  all  traveling 
line 764=>
line 765=>####-expenses  guaranteed  in  any  event;  funeral  expenses  to  be  defrayed  by  us  or 
line 766=>our representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged 
line 767=>for. 
line 768=>"Thinking  it  unnecessary  to  disturb  your  esteemed  repose,  we  have 
line 769=>proceeded  in  advance  to  make  requisite  preparations,  and  shall  await  your 
line 770=>respected person at the Green Dragon Inn, Bywater, at II a.m. sharp. Trusting 
line 771=>that you will be punctual. 
line 772=> 
line 773=>"We have the honour to remain

line 775=>                                              "Thorin& Co." 
line 776=>
line 777=> 
line 778=>"That leaves you just ten minutes. You will have to run," said Gandalf. 
line 779=>"But—" said Bilbo. 
line 780=>"No time for it," said the wizard. 
line 781=>"But—"said Bilbo again. 
line 782=>"No time for that either! Off you go!" 
line 783=>To  the  end  of  his  days  Bilbo  could  never  remember  how  he  found  himself 
line 784=>outside,  without  a  hat,  walking-stick  or  say  money,  or  anything  that  he  usually 
line 785=>took  when  he  went  out;  leaving  his  second  breakfast  half-finished  and  quite 
line 786=>unwashed-up,  pushing  his  keys  into  Gandalf's  hands,  and  running  as  fast  as  his 
line 787=>furry  feet  could  carry  him  down  the  lane,  past  the  great Mill,  across  The Water, 
line 788=>and then on for a whole mile or more. Very puffed he was, when he got to Bywater 
line 789=>just  on  the  stroke  of  eleven,  and  found  he  had  come  without  a  pocket-
line 790=>handkerchief! 
line 791=>"Bravo!" said Balin who was standing at the inn door looking out for him. 
line 792=>Just  then  all  the  others  came  round  the  corner  of  the  road  from  the  village. 
line 793=>They were on ponies, and each pony was  slung about with all kinds of baggages, 
line 794=>packages, parcels, and paraphernalia. There was a very small pony, apparently for 
line 795=>Bilbo. 
line 796=>"Up you two get, and off we go!" said Thorin. 
line 797=>"I'm  awfully  sorry,"  said Bilbo,  "but  I  have  come without my  hat,  and  I  have 
line 798=>left my pocket-handkerchief behind, and I haven't got any money. I didn't get your 
line 799=>note until after 10.45 to be precise." 
line 800=>"Don't  be  precise,"  said  Dwalin,  "and  don't  worry!  You will  have  to manage 
line 801=>without pocket-handkerchiefs, and a good many other things, before you get to the 
line 802=>journey's end. As for a hat, I have got a spare hood and cloak in my luggage." 
line 803=>
line 804=>####-That's  how  they  all  came  to  start,  jogging  off  from  the  inn  one  fine  morning 
line 805=>just  before  May,  on  laden  ponies;  and  Bilbo  was  wearing  a  dark-green  hood  (a 
line 806=>little  weather-stained)  and  a  dark-green cloak borrowed  from Dwalin. They were 
line 807=>too large for him, and he looked rather comic. What his father Bungo would have 
line 808=>thought of him, I daren't think. His only comfort was he couldn't be mistaken for a 
line 809=>dwarf, as he had no beard. 
line 810=>They had not been riding very long when up came Gandalf very splendid on a 
line 811=>white  horse.  He  had  brought  a  lot  of  pocket-handkerchiefs,  and Bilbo's  pipe  and 
line 812=>tobacco.  So  after  that  the  party  went  along  very  merrily,  and  they  told  stories  or 
line 813=>sang  songs  as  they  rode  forward  all  day,  except  of  course  when  they  stopped  for 
line 814=>meals. These didn't  come quite  as often  as Bilbo would have  liked  them, but  still 
line 815=>he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all. At  first they had passed 
line 816=>through  hobbit-lands,  a  wild  respectable  country  inhabited  by  decent  folk,  with 
line 817=>good  roads,  an  inn  or  two,  and  now  and  then  a  dwarf  or  a  farmer  ambling  by  on 
line 818=>business.  Then  they  came  to  lands where people  spoke  strangely,  and  sang  songs 
line 819=>Bilbo  had  never  heard  before.  Now  they  had  gone  on  far  into  the  Lone-lands, 
line 820=>where  there were  no  people  left,  no  inns,  and  the  roads  grew  steadily worse. Not 
line 821=>far  ahead were  dreary  hills,  rising  higher  and  higher, dark with trees. On some of 
line 822=>them  were  old  castles  with  an  evil  look,  as  if  they  had  been  built  by  wicked 
line 823=>people.  Everything  seemed  gloomy,  for  the  weather  that  day  had  taken  a  nasty 
line 824=>turn. Mostly  it  had  been  as  good  as May  can  be,  even  in  merry  tales, but now  it 
line 825=>was  cold  and  wet.  In  the  Lone-lands  they  had  to  camp  when  they  could,  but  at 
line 826=>least  it  had  been  dry.  "To  think  it  will  soon  be  June,"  grumbled  Bilbo  as  he 
line 827=>splashed  along  behind  the  others  in  a  very  muddy  track.  It  was  after  tea-time;  it 
line 828=>was  pouring with  rain, and had been all day; his hood was dripping  into his eyes, 
line 829=>his cloak was full of water;  the pony was  tired and stumbled on stones;  the others 
line 830=>were  too  grumpy  to  talk.  "And  I'm  sure  the  rain  has  got  into  the  dry  clothes  and 
line 831=>into  the  food-bags," thought Bilbo. "Bother burgling and everything to do with it! 
line 832=>I wish  I was at home  in my nice hole by  the  fire, with  the kettle  just beginning  to 
line 833=>sing!" It was not the last time that he wished that! 
line 834=>Still  the  dwarves  jogged  on,  never  turning  round  or  taking  any  notice  of  the 
line 835=>hobbit.  Somewhere  behind  the  grey  clouds  the  sun  must  have  gone  down,  for  it 
line 836=>began  to  get  dark.  Wind  got  up,  and  the  willows  along  the  river-bank  bent  and 
line 837=>sighed. I don't know what river it was, a rushing red one, swollen with the rains of 
line 838=>the  last  few  days,  that  came  down  from  the  hills  and mountains  in  front  of  them. 
line 839=>Soon it was nearly dark. The winds broke up the grey clouds, and a waning moon 
line 840=>appeared  above  the  hills  between  the  flying  rags.  Then  they  stopped,  and  Thorin 
line 841=>
line 842=>####-muttered  something  about  supper,  "and  where  shall  we  get  a  dry  patch  to  sleep 
line 843=>on?" Not until  then did  they notice  that Gandalf was missing. So far he had come 
line 844=>all  the way with  them, never  saying  if he was  in  the adventure or merely keeping 
line 845=>them  company  for  a  while.  He  had  eaten  most,  talked  most,  and  laughed  most. 
line 846=>But now he simply was not there at all! 
line 847=>"Just  when  a  wizard  would  have  been  most  useful,  too,"  groaned  Dori  and 
line 848=>Nori  (who  shared  the hobbit's views about  regular meals, plenty and often). They 
line 849=>decided in  the end that they would have to camp where they were. So far they had 
line 850=>not  camped  before  on  this  journey,  and  though  they  knew  that  they  soon  would 
line 851=>have to camp regularly, when they were among the Misty Mountains and far from 
line 852=>the  lands  of  respectable  people,  it  seemed  a  bad  wet  evening  to  begin,  on.  They 
line 853=>moved to a clump of trees, and though it was drier under them, the wind shook the 
line 854=>rain  off  the  leaves,  and  the  drip,  drip,  was  most  annoying.  Also  the  mischief 
line 855=>seemed to have got into the fire. Dwarves can make a fire almost anywhere out of 
line 856=>almost anything, wind or no wind; but they could not do it that night, not even Oin 
line 857=>and Gloin, who were specially good at it. 
line 858=>Then one of  the ponies  took  fright at nothing and bolted. He got  into  the  river 
line 859=>before they could catch him; and before they could get him out again, Fili and Kili 
line 860=>were  nearly  drowned,  and  all  the  baggage  that  he  carried  was  washed  away  off 
line 861=>him. Of course it was mostly food, and there was mighty little left for supper, and 
line 862=>less  for  breakfast.  There  they  all  sat  glum  and wet  and muttering, while Oin  and 
line 863=>Gloin  went  on  trying  to  light  the  fire,  and  quarrelling  about  it.  Bilbo  was  sadly 
line 864=>reflecting  that  adventures  are  not  all  pony-rides  in  May-sunshine,  when  Balin, 
line 865=>who was  always  their  look-out man, said:  "There's a light over there!" There was 
line 866=>a hill  some way off with  trees on  it, pretty  thick  in parts. Out of  the dark mass of 
line 867=>the  trees  they  could  now  see  a  light  shining,  a  reddish  comfortable-looking light, 
line 868=>as  it  might  be  a  fire  or  torches  twinkling.  When  they  had  looked  at  it  for  some 
line 869=>while,  they  fell  to  arguing.  Some  said  "no"  and  some  said  "yes."  Some  said  they 
line 870=>could but go and see, and anything was better than little supper, less breakfast, and 
line 871=>wet  clothes  all  the  night. Others  said:  "These  parts  are  none  too well known, and 
line 872=>are  too  near  the mountains. Travellers  seldom  come  this way  now. The  old maps 
line 873=>are  no  use:  things  have  changed  for  the  worse  and  the  road  is  unguarded.    They 
line 874=>have seldom even heard of the king round here, and the less inquisitive you are as 
line 875=>you  go  along,  the  less  trouble  you  are  likely  to  find."  Some  said:  "After  all  there 
line 876=>are  fourteen  of  us."  Others  said:  "Where  has  Gandalf  got  to?"  This  remark  was 
line 877=>repeated  by  everybody.  Then  the  rain  began  to  pour  down  worse  than  ever,  and 
line 878=>Oin and Gloin began to fight. That settled it. "After all we have got a burglar with 
line 879=>
line 880=>####-us,"  they said; and so  they made off,  leading  their ponies (with all due and proper 
line 881=>caution)  in  the  direction  of  the  light.  They  came  to  the  hill  and  were  soon  in  the 
line 882=>wood.  Up  the  hill  they  went;  but  there  was  no  proper  path  to  be  seen,  such  as 
line 883=>might  lead  to  a  house  or  a  farm;  and  do  what  they  could  they  made  a  deal  of 
line 884=>rustling  and  crackling  and  creaking  (and  a good deal of grumbling  and drafting), 
line 885=>as they went through the trees in the pitch dark. 
line 886=>Suddenly  the  red  light  shone  out  very  bright  through  the  tree-trunks  not  far 
line 887=>ahead.  "Now  it  is  the  burglar's  turn,"  they  said, meaning Bilbo.  "You must  go  on 
line 888=>and  find  out  all  about  that  light,  and what  it  is  for,  and  if  all  is  perfectly  safe and 
line 889=>canny," said Thorin to the hobbit. "Now scuttle off, and come back quick, if all is 
line 890=>well.  If  not,  come  back  if  you  can!  It  you  can't,  hoot  twice  like  a  barn-owl and 
line 891=>once like a screech-owl, and we will do what we can." 
line 892=>Off Bilbo had  to go, before he  could explain that he could not hoot even once 
line 893=>like  any  kind  of  owl  any  more  than  fly  like  a  bat.  But  at  any  rate  hobbits  can 
line 894=>move quietly  in woods,  absolutely quietly. They  take  a pride  in  it,  and Bilbo had 
line 895=>sniffed  more  than  once  at  what  he  called  "all  this dwarvish  racket," as  they went 
line 896=>along,  though  I  don't  sup-pose  you  or  I  would  notice  anything  at  all  on  a  windy 
line 897=>night,  not  if  the  whole  cavalcade  had  passed  two  feet  off.  As  for  Bilbo  walking 
line 898=>primly  towards  the  red  light,  I  don't  suppose  even  a  weasel  would  have  stirred  a 
line 899=>whisker  at  it.  So,  naturally,  he  got  right  up  to  the  fire-for  fire  it  was  without 
line 900=>disturbing anyone. And this is what he saw. Three very large persons sitting round 
line 901=>a  very  large  fire  of  beech-logs. They were  toasting mutton  on  long  spits of wood, 
line 902=>and  licking  the  gravy  off  their  fingers.  There  was  a  fine  toothsome  smell.  Also 
line 903=>there was a barrel of good drink at hand, and  they were drinking out of  jugs. But 
line 904=>they were  trolls. Obviously  trolls.  Even Bilbo,  in  spite  of  his  sheltered  life,  could 
line 905=>see  that:  from  the great heavy  faces of  them, and  their size, and  the shape of  their 
line 906=>legs, not to mention their language, which was not drawing-room fashion at all, at 
line 907=>all. 
line 908=>"Mutton yesterday, mutton today, and blimey, if it don't look like mutton again 
line 909=>tomorrer," said one of the trolls. 
line 910=>"Never  a  blinking  bit  of  manflesh  have  we  had  for  long  enough,"  said  a 
line 911=>second.  "What  the  'ell William was  a-thinkin' of to bring us into these parts at all, 
line 912=>beats me  - and  the drink  runnin'  short, what's more," he  said  jogging the elbow of 
line 913=>William, who was taking a pull at his jug. 
line 914=>William  choked.  "Shut  yer  mouth!"  he  said  as  soon  as  he  could.  "Yer  can't 
line 915=>expect  folk  to stop here  for ever  just  to be et by you and Bert. You've et a village 
line 916=>and a half between yer, since we come down from the mountains. How much more 
line 917=>
line 918=>####-d'yer want? And time's been up our way, when yer'd have said 'thank yer Bill' for a 
line 919=>nice bit o'  fat valley mutton  like what  this  is." He  took a big bite off a  sheep's  leg 
line 920=>he was toasting, and wiped his lips on his sleeve. 
line 921=>Yes, I am afraid trolls do behave like that, even those with only one head each. 
line 922=>After  hearing  all  this  Bilbo  ought  to  have  done  something  at  once.  Either  he 
line 923=>should  have  gone  back  quietly  and  warned  his  friends  that  there  were  three  fair-
line 924=>sized  trolls  at  hand  in  a  nasty  mood,  quite  likely  to  try  toasted  dwarf,  or  even 
line 925=>pony,  for  a  change;  or  else  he  should  have  done  a  bit  of  good  quick  burgling.  A 
line 926=>really  first-class  and  legendary  burglar would  at  this  point  have  picked  the  trolls' 
line 927=>pockets-it  is  nearly  always  worthwhile  if  you  can  manage  it-,  pinched  the  very 
line 928=>mutton off the spite, purloined the beer, and walked off without their noticing him. 
line 929=>Others more practical but with less professional pride would perhaps have stuck a 
line 930=>dagger  into  each  of  them  before  they observed  it. Then  the night could have been 
line 931=>spent cheerily.  
line 932=>Bilbo knew  it. He had  read of a good many  things he had never seen or done. 
line 933=>He  was  very  much  alarmed,  as  well  as  disgusted;  he  wished  himself  a  hundred 
line 934=>miles away, and yet-and yet somehow he could not go straight back to Thorin and 
line 935=>Company empty-handed. So he stood and hesitated in the shadows. Of the various 
line 936=>burglarious  proceedings  he  had  heard  of  picking  the  trolls'  pockets  seemed  the 
line 937=>least difficult, so at last he crept behind a tree just behind William. 
line 938=>Bert and Tom went off  to  the barrel. William was having another drink. Then 
line 939=>Bilbo  plucked  up  courage  and  put  his  little  hand  in William's  enormous  pocket. 
line 940=>There was a purse in it, as big as a bag to Bilbo. "Ha!" thought he warming to his 
line 941=>new work as he lifted it carefully out, "this is a beginning!" 
line 942=>It was! Trolls' purses are the mischief, and this was no exception. " 'Ere, 'oo are 
line 943=>you?"  it  squeaked,  as  it  left  the  pocket;  and  William  turned  round  at  once  and 
line 944=>grabbed Bilbo by the neck, before he could duck behind the tree. 
line 945=>"Blimey, Bert, look what I've copped!" said William. 
line 946=>"What is it?" said the others coming up. 
line 947=>"Lumme, if I knows! What are yer?" 
line 948=>"Bilbo  Baggins,  a  bur—  a  hobbit,"  said  poor  Bilbo,  shaking  all  over,  and 
line 949=>wondering how to make owl-noises before they throttled him. 
line 950=>"A  burrahobbit?"  said  they  a  bit  startled.  Trolls  are  slow  in  the  uptake,  and 
line 951=>mighty suspicious about anything new to them. 
line 952=>"What's a burrahobbit got to do with my pocket, anyways?" said William. 
line 953=>"And can yer cook 'em?" said Tom. 
line 954=>"Yer can try," said Bert, picking up a skewer.  
line 955=>
line 956=>####-"He wouldn't make  above  a mouthful,"  said William, who  had  already  had  a 
line 957=>fine supper, "not when he was skinned and boned." 
line 958=>"P'raps  there  are more  like  him  round  about,  and we might make  a  pie,"  said 
line 959=>Bert.  "Here  you,  are  there  any  more  of  your  sort  a-sneakin'  in  these  here woods, 
line 960=>yer  nassty  little  rabbit,"  said  he  looking  at  the  hobbit's  furry  feet;  and  he  picked 
line 961=>him up by the toes and shook him. 
line 962=>"Yes,  lots,"  said  Bilbo,  before  he  remembered  not  to  give  his  friends  away. 
line 963=>"No, none at all, not one," he said immediately afterwards. 
line 964=>"What  d'yer  mean?"  said  Bert,  holding  him  right  away  up,  by  the  hair  this 
line 965=>time. 
line 966=>"What I say," said Bilbo gasping. "And please don't cook me, kind sirs! I am a 
line 967=>good  cook myself,  and  cook  bet-ter  than  I cook,  if you  see what  I mean.  I'll cook 
line 968=>beautifully for you, a perfectly beautiful breakfast for you, if only you won't have 
line 969=>me for supper." 
line 970=>"Poor  little blighter,"  said William. He had  already had  as much  supper  as he 
line 971=>could hold; also he had had lots of beer. "Poor little blighter! Let him go!" 
line 972=>"Not  till  he  says  what  he  means  by  lots  and  none  at  all,"  said  Bert.  "I  don't 
line 973=>want to have me throat cut in me sleep. Hold his toes in the fire, till he talks!" 
line 974=>"I won't have it," said William. "I caught him anyway." 
line 975=>"You're a fat fool, William," said Bert, "as I've said afore this evening." 
line 976=>"And you're a lout!" 
line 977=>"And  I won't  take  that  from you. Bill Huggins,"  says Bert, and puts his  fist  in 
line 978=>William's eye. 
line 979=>Then  there  was  a  gorgeous  row.  Bilbo  had  just  enough  wits  left,  when  Bert 
line 980=>dropped  him  on  the  ground,  to  scramble  out  of  the way  of  their  feet,  before  they 
line 981=>were  fighting  like  dogs,  and  calling  one  another  all  sorts  of  perfectly  true  and 
line 982=>applicable  names  in  very  loud  voices.  Soon  they  were  locked  in  one  another's 
line 983=>arms,  and  rolling  nearly  into  the  fire  kicking  and  thumping, while Tom whacked 
line 984=>at  then  both  with  a  branch  to  bring  them  to  their  senses-and  that  of  course  only 
line 985=>made  them  madder  than  ever.  That  would  have  been  the  time  for  Bilbo  to  have 
line 986=>left. But his poor  little  feet had been very  squashed  in Bert's big paw,  and he had 
line 987=>no  breath  in  his  body,  and  his  head was  going  round;  so  there  he  lay  for  a while 
line 988=>panting, just outside the circle of firelight. 
line 989=>Right  in  the middle of  the  fight up  came Balin. The dwarves had heard noises 
line 990=>from  a  distance,  and  after  wait-ing  for  some  time  for  Bilbo  to  come  back,  or  to 
line 991=>hoot  like  an  owl,  they  started  off  one  by  one  to  creep  towards  the  light  as  quietly 
line 992=>as  they  could.  No  sooner  did  Tom  see  Balin  come  into  the  light  than he gave an 
line 993=>
line 994=>####-awful  howl.  Trolls  simply  detest  the  very  sight  of  dwarves  (uncooked).  Bert  and 
line 995=>Bill  stopped  fighting  immediately,  and  "a  sack,  Tom,  quick!"  they  said,  before 
line 996=>Balin,  who  was  wondering  where  in  all  this  commotion  Bilbo  was,  knew  what 
line 997=>was happening, a sack was over his head, and he was down. 
line 998=>"There's more  to come yet," said Tom, "or I'm mighty mistook. Lots and none 
line 999=>at  all,  it  is,"  said  he.  "No  burra-  hobbits,  but  lots  of  these  here  dwarves.  That's 
line 1000=>about the shape of it!" 
line 1001=>"I reckon you 're right," said Bert, "and we'd best get out of the light." 
line 1002=>And  so  they  did.  With  sacks  in  their  hands,  that  they  used  for  carrying  off 
line 1003=>mutton and other plunder, they waited in the shadows. As each dwarf came up and 
line 1004=>looked  at  the  fire,  and  the  spilled  jugs,  and  the  gnawed mutton,  in  surprise,  pop! 
line 1005=>went  a  nasty  smelly  sack  over  his  head,  and  he  was  down.  Soon  Dwalin  lay  by 
line 1006=>Balin, and Fili and Kili together, and Dori and Nori and Ori all in a heap, and Oin 
line 1007=>and Gloin and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur piled uncomfortably near the fire. 
line 1008=>"That'll teach 'em," said Tom; for Bifur and Bombur had given a lot of trouble, 
line 1009=>and fought like mad, as dwarves will when cornered. 
line 1010=>Thorin  came  last-and  he  was  not  caught  unawares.  He  came  expecting 
line 1011=>mischief,  and  didn't  need  to  see  his  friends'  legs  sticking  out  of  sacks  to  tell  him 
line 1012=>that  things were  not  all well. He  stood  outside  in  the  shadows  some way  off,  and 
line 1013=>said: "What's all this trouble? Who has been knocking my people about?" 
line 1014=>"It's  trolls!"  said  Bilbo  from  behind  a  tree.  They  had  forgotten  all  about him. 
line 1015=>"They're hiding in the bushes with sacks," said he. 
line 1016=>"O!  are  they?"  said  Thorin,  and  he  jumped  forward  to  the  fire,  before  they 
line 1017=>could  leap on him. He caught up a big branch all on fire at one end; and Bert got 
line 1018=>that  end  in  his  eye before he could step aside. That put him out of  the battle  for a 
line 1019=>bit.  Bilbo  did  his  best.  He  caught  hold  of  Tom's  leg-as  well  as  he  could,  it  was 
line 1020=>thick  as  a  young  tree-trunk  -but  he  was  sent  spinning  up  into  the  top  of  some 
line 1021=>bushes, when Tom kicked the sparks up in Thorin's face. 
line 1022=>Tom got the branch in his teeth for that, and lost one of the front ones. It made 
line 1023=>him  howl,  I  can  tell  you.  But  just  at  that  moment  William  came  up  behind  and 
line 1024=>popped  a  sack  right  over  Thorin's  head  and  down  to  his  toes.  And  so  the  fight 
line 1025=>ended. A  nice  pickle  they were  all  in  now:  all  neatly  tied  up  in  sacks, with  three 
line 1026=>angry trolls (and two with burns and bashes to remember) sitting by them, arguing 
line 1027=>whether  they  should  roast  them  slowly,  or mince  them  fine  and  boil  them,  or  just 
line 1028=>sit on them one by one and squash them into jelly: and Bilbo up in a bush, with his 
line 1029=>clothes and his skin torn, not daring to move for fear they should hear him. 
line 1030=> 
line 1031=>
line 1032=>####-It was  just  then  that Gandalf  came  back. But  no  one  saw  him. The  trolls  had 
line 1033=>just  decided  to  roast  the dwarves now and eat  them  later-that was Bert's idea, and 
line 1034=>after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it. 
line 1035=>"No  good  roasting  'em  now,  it’d  take  all  night,"  said  a  voice.  Bert  thought  it 
line 1036=>was William's. 
line 1037=>"Don't  start  the  argument  all  over-again.  Bill,"  he  said,  "or  it  will  take  all 
line 1038=>night." 
line 1039=>"Who's a-arguing?" said William, who thought it was. Bert that had spoken. 
line 1040=>"You are," said Bert. 
line 1041=>"You're  a  liar,"  said William;  and  so  the  argument  beg  all  over  again.  In  the 
line 1042=>end  they  decided  to  mince  them  fine  and  boil  them. So  they got  a black pot,  and 
line 1043=>they took out their knives. 
line 1044=>"No  good  boiling  'em! We  ain't  got  no  water,  and  it's  a  long  way  to  the  well 
line 1045=>and all," said a voice. Bert and William thought it was Tom's. 
line 1046=>"Shut  up!"  said  they,  "or  we'll  never  have  done.  And  yer  can  fetch  the water 
line 1047=>yerself, if yer say any more." 
line 1048=>"Shut  up  yerself!"  said  Tom,  who  thought  it  was  William's  voice.  "Who's 
line 1049=>arguing but you. I'd like to know." 
line 1050=>"You're a booby," said William. 
line 1051=>"Booby yerself!" said Tom. 
line 1052=>And  so  the  argument  began  all  over again, and went on hotter than ever, until 
line 1053=>at last they decided to sit on the sacks one by one and squash them, and boil them 
line 1054=>next time. 
line 1055=>"Who shall we sit on first?" said the voice. 
line 1056=>"Better sit on  the  last fellow first," said Bert, whose eye had been damaged by 
line 1057=>Thorin. He thought Tom was talking. 
line 1058=>"Don't talk to yerself!" said Tom. "But if you wants to sit on the last one, sit on 
line 1059=>him. Which is he?" 
line 1060=>"The one with the yellow stockings," said Bert. 
line 1061=>"Nonsense, the one with the grey stockings," said a voice like William's. 
line 1062=>"I made sure it was yellow," said Bert. 
line 1063=>"Yellow it was," said William. 
line 1064=>"Then what did yer say it was grey for?" said Bert. 
line 1065=>"I never did. Tom said it." 
line 1066=>"That I never did!" said Tom. "It was you." 
line 1067=>"Two to one, so shut yer mouth!" said Bert. 
line 1068=>"Who are you a-talkin' to?" said William. 
line 1069=>
line 1070=>####-"Now  stop  it!"  said  Tom  and  Bert  together.  "The  night's  gettin'  on,  and  dawn 
line 1071=>comes early. Let's get on with it!" 
line 1072=>"Dawn  take  you  all,  and  be  stone  to  you!"  said  a  voice  that  sounded  like 
line 1073=>William's. But  it wasn't. For  just  at  that moment  the  light  came over  the hill,  and 
line 1074=>there  was  a  mighty  twitter  in  the  branches.  William  never  spoke  for  he  stood 
line 1075=>turned  to  stone  as  he  stooped;  and  Bert  and  Tom  were  stuck  like  rocks  as  they 
line 1076=>looked at him. And there they stand to this day,  all alone, unless the birds perch on 
line 1077=>them; for trolls, as you probably know, must be underground before dawn, or they 
line 1078=>go  back  to  the  stuff  of  the  mountains  they  are  made  of,  and  never  move  again. 
line 1079=>That is what had happened to Bert and Tom and William. 
line 1080=>"Excellent!"  said Gandalf, as he  stepped  from behind a  tree, and helped Bilbo 
line 1081=>to  climb  down  out  of  a  thorn-bush.  Then  Bilbo  understood.  It  was  the  wizard's 
line 1082=>voice  that  had  kept  the  trolls  bickering  and  quarrelling,  until  the  light  came  and 
line 1083=>made an end of them. 
line 1084=>The  next  thing  was  to  untie  the  sacks  and  let  out  the  dwarves.  They  were 
line 1085=>nearly  suffocated,  and  very  annoyed:  they  had  not  at  all  enjoyed  lying  there 
line 1086=>listening  to  the  trolls  making  plans  for  roasting  them  and  squashing  them  and 
line 1087=>mincing  them.  They  had  to  hear  Bilbo's  account  of  what  had  happened  to  him 
line 1088=>twice over, before they were satisfied.  
line 1089=>"Silly time to go practising pinching and pocket-picking," said Bombur, "when 
line 1090=>what we wanted was fire and food!" 
line 1091=>"And  that's  just  what  you  wouldn't  have  got  of  those  fellows  without  a 
line 1092=>struggle, in any case," said Gandalf. 
line 1093=>"Anyhow you are wasting time now. Don't you realize that the trolls must have 
line 1094=>a cave or a hole dug  somewhere near  to hide  from  the  sun  in? We must  look  into 
line 1095=>it!" 
line 1096=>They  searched  about,  and  soon  found  the  marks  of  trolls'  stony  boots  going 
line 1097=>away  through  the  trees.  They  followed  the  tracks  up  the  hill,  until  hidden  by 
line 1098=>bushes  they  came  on  a  big  door  of  stone  leading  to  a  cave.  But  they  could  not 
line 1099=>open it, not though they all pushed while Gandalf tried various incantations. 
line 1100=>"Would  this  be  any  good?"  asked  Bilbo,  when  they  were  getting  tired  and 
line 1101=>angry.  "I  found  it  on  the  ground  where  the  trolls  had  their  fight."  He  held  out  a 
line 1102=>largish key, though no doubt William had thought it very small and secret. It must 
line 1103=>have fallen out of his pocket, very luckily, before he was turned to stone. 
line 1104=>"Why on earth didn't you mention it before?" they cried. 
line 1105=>Gandalf  grabbed  it  and  fitted  it  into  the  key-hole. Then  the  stone door  swung 
line 1106=>back  with  one  big  push,  and  they  all  went  inside.  There were  bones  on  the  floor 
line 1107=>
line 1108=>####-and  a  nasty  smell  was  in  the  air;  but  there  was  a  good  deal  of  food  jumbled 
line 1109=>carelessly  on  shelves  and  on  the  ground,  among  an  untidy  litter  of  plunder,  of  all 
line 1110=>sorts from brass buttons to pots full of gold coins standing in a corner. There were 
line 1111=>lots  of  clothes,  too,  hanging  on  the  walls-too  small  for  trolls,  I  am  afraid  they 
line 1112=>belonged  to  victims-and  among  them  were  several  swords  of  various  makes, 
line 1113=>shapes,  and  sizes.  Two  caught  their  eyes  particularly,  because  of  their  beautiful 
line 1114=>scabbards  and  jewelled  hilts.  Gandalf  and  Thorin  each  took  one  of  these;  and 
line 1115=>Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. It would have made only a tiny pocket-knife 
line 1116=>for a troll, but it was as good as a short sword for the hobbit. 
line 1117=>"These look like good blades," said the wizard, half drawing them and looking 
line 1118=>at them curiously. "They were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men 
line 1119=>in  these  parts  and  days;  but when we  can  read  the  runes  on  them, we  shall  know 
line 1120=>more about them." 
line 1121=>"Let's  get  out  of  this  horrible  smell!"  said  Fili  So  they  carried  out  the  pots  of 
line 1122=>coins, and such food as was un-touched and looked fit to eat, also one barrel of ale 
line 1123=>which  was  still  full.  By  that  time  they  felt  like  breakfast,  and  being  very  hungry 
line 1124=>they  did  not  turn  their  noses  up  at what  they had got  from  the  trolls'  larder. Their 
line 1125=>own  provisions were  very  scanty. Now  they  had  bread  and  cheese,  and  plenty  of 
line 1126=>ale,  and  bacon  to  toast  in  the  embers  of  the  fire.  After  that  they  slept,  for  their 
line 1127=>night had been disturbed; (and they did nothing more till the afternoon. Then they 
line 1128=>I brought up their ponies, and carried away the pots of gold, and buried them very 
line 1129=>secretly not far from the track by the river, putting a great many spells over them, 
line 1130=>just  in  case  they  ever  had  the-chance  to  come  back  and  recover  them. When  that 
line 1131=>was  done,  they  all  mounted  once  more,  and  jogged  along  again  on  the  path 
line 1132=>towards the East. 
line 1133=>"Where  did  you  go  to,  if  I  may  ask?"  said  Thorin  to  Gandalf  as  they  rode 
line 1134=>along. 
line 1135=>"To look ahead," said he. 
line 1136=>"And what brought you back in the nick of time?" 
line 1137=>"Looking behind," said he. 
line 1138=>"Exactly!" said Thorin; "but could you be more plain?" 
line 1139=>"I  went  on  to  spy  out  our  road.  It  will  soon  become  dangerous  and  difficult. 
line 1140=>Also  I  was  anxious  about  replenishing  our  small  stock  of  provisions.  I  had  not 
line 1141=>gone very far, however, when I met a couple of friends of mine from Rivendell." 
line 1142=>"Where's that?" asked Bilbo, 
line 1143=>"Don't interrupt!" said Gandalf. "You will get there in a few days now, if we're 
line 1144=>lucky, and find out all about it As I was saying I met two of Elrond's people. They 
line 1145=>
line 1146=>####-were  hurrying  along  for  fear  of  the  trolls.  It  was  they  who  told  me  that  three  of 
line 1147=>them had come down from the mountains and settled in the woods not far from the 
line 1148=>road;  they  had  frightened  everyone  away  from  the  district,  and  they  waylaid 
line 1149=>strangers. 
line 1150=>"I  immediately had  a  feeling  that  I was wanted back. Looking behind  I  saw  a 
line 1151=>fire  in  the  distance  and  made  for  it.  So  now  you  know.  Please  be  more  careful, 
line 1152=>next time, or we shall never get anywhere!" 
line 1153=>"Thank you!" said Thorin. 
line 1154=>
line 1155=>####-<h4>Chapter 3 </h4> <br>
line 1156=><br>
line 1157=>A Short Rest 
line 1158=><br>
line 1159=> 
line 1160=>They  did  not  sing  or  tell  stories  that  day,  even  though  the weather  improved; 
line 1161=>nor the next day, nor the day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far 
line 1162=>away on either side. They camped under the stars, and their horses had more to eat 
line 1163=>than  they had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in their bags, 
line 1164=>even with what  they had got  from  the  trolls. One morning  they  forded a  river at a 
line 1165=>wide  shallow  place  full  of  the  noise  of  stones  and  foam.  The  far  bank  was  steep 
line 1166=>and slippery. When they got to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the 
line 1167=>great mountains had marched down very near to them. Already they I seemed only 
line 1168=>a day's easy journey from the feet of the nearest. Dark and drear it looked, though 
line 1169=>there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and behind its shoulders the tips 
line 1170=>of snow-peaks gleamed. 
line 1171=>"Is  that  The  Mountain?"  asked  Bilbo  in  a  solemn  voice,  looking  at  it  with 
line 1172=>round eyes. He had never seen a thing that looked so big before. 
line 1173=>"Of  course  not!"  said  Balin.  "That  is  only  the  beginning  of  the  Misty 
line 1174=>Mountains,  and we  have  to  get  through,  or  over,  or  under  those  somehow,  before 
line 1175=>we  can  come  into  Wilderland  beyond.  And  it  is  a  deal  of  a  way  even  from  the 
line 1176=>other  side  of  them  to  the  Lonely Mountain  in  the  East Where  Smaug  lies on our 
line 1177=>treasure." 
line 1178=>"O!"  said  Bilbo,  and  just  at  that  moment  he  felt  more  fared  than  he  ever 
line 1179=>remembered  feeling  before. He was  thinking  once  again  of  his  comfortable  chair 
line 1180=>before  the  fire  in  his  favourite  sitting-room  in  his  hobbit-hole,  and  of  the  kettle 
line 1181=>singing. Not for the last time! 
line 1182=>Now  Gandalf  led  the  way.  "We  must  not  miss  the  road,  or  we  shall  be  done 
line 1183=>for,"  he  said.  "We  need  food,  for  one  thing,  and  rest  in  reasonable  safety-also it is 
line 1184=>very necessary  to  tackle  the Misty Mountains by  the proper path, or else you will 
line 1185=>get  lost  in  them,  and  have  to  come  back  and  start  at  the  beginning  again  (if  you 
line 1186=>ever get back at all)." 
line 1187=>They asked him where he was making for, and he answered: "You are come to 
line 1188=>the very edge of the Wild, as some of you may know. Hidden somewhere ahead of 
line 1189=>us  is  the  fair valley of Rivendell where Elrond  lives  in  the Last Homely House.  I 
line 1190=>sent a message by my friends, and we are expected." 
line 1191=>That  sounded  nice  and  comforting,  but  they  had  not  got  there  yet,  and  it was 
line 1192=>not  so  easy  as  it  sounds  to  find  the  Last  Homely  House  west  of  the  Mountains. 
line 1193=>
line 1194=>####-There  seemed  to  be  no  trees  and  no  valleys  and  no  hills  to  break  the  ground  in 
line 1195=>front  of  them,  only  one  vast  slope  going  slowly  up  and  up  to meet  the  feet  of  the 
line 1196=>nearest  mountain,  a  wide  land  the  colour  of  heather  and  crumbling  rock,  with 
line 1197=>patches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might be. 
line 1198=>Morning  passed,  afternoon  came;  but  in  all  the  silent waste  there was  no  sign 
line 1199=>of  any  dwelling.  They  were  growing  anxious,  for  they  now  saw  that  the  house 
line 1200=>might be hidden almost anywhere between them and the mountains. They came on 
line 1201=>unexpected valleys, narrow with deep sides, that opened suddenly at their feet, and 
line 1202=>they  looked  down  surprised  to  see  trees  below  them  and  running  water  at  the 
line 1203=>bottom.  There  were  gullies  that  they  could  almost  leap  over;  but  very  deep  with 
line 1204=>waterfalls in them. There were dark ravines that one could neither jump nor climb 
line 1205=>into. There were bogs, some of them green pleasant places to look at with flowers 
line 1206=>growing  bright  and  tall;  but  a  pony  that  walked  there  with  a  pack  on  its  back 
line 1207=>would never have come out again. 
line 1208=>It was indeed a much wider land from the ford to the mountains than ever you 
line 1209=>would have guessed. Bilbo was astonished. The only path was marked with white 
line 1210=>stones  some  of  which  were  small,  and  others  were  half  covered  with  moss  or 
line 1211=>heather.  Altogether  it  was  a  very  slow  business  following  the  track,  even  guided 
line 1212=>by Gandalf, who seemed to know his way about pretty well. 
line 1213=>His head and beard wagged  this way and  that as he looked for the stones, and 
line 1214=>they  followed  his  head,  but  they  seemed  no  nearer  to  the  end  of  the  search when 
line 1215=>the day began to fail. Tea-time had long gone by, and it seemed supper-time would 
line 1216=>soon  do  the  same.  There  were  moths  fluttering  about,  and  the  light  became  very 
line 1217=>dim,  for  the  moon  had  not  risen.  Bilbo's  pony  began  to  stumble  over  roots  and 
line 1218=>stones.  They  came  to  the  edge  of  a  steep  fall  in  the  ground  so  suddenly  that 
line 1219=>Gandalf s horse nearly slipped down the slope. 
line 1220=>"Here  it  is  at  last!"  he  called,  and  the  others  gathered  round  him  and  looked 
line 1221=>over the edge. They saw a valley far below. They could hear the voice of hurrying 
line 1222=>water in rocky bed at the bottom; the scent of trees was in the air; and there was a 
line 1223=>light  on  the  valley-side across the water. Bilbo never forgot the way they slithered 
line 1224=>and  slipped  in  the  dusk  down  the  steep  zig-zag  path  into  the  secret  valley  of 
line 1225=>Rivendell. The air grew warmer as  they got  lower, and  the  smell of  the pine-trees 
line 1226=>made  him  drowsy,  so  that  every  now  and  again  he  nodded  and  nearly  fell off, or 
line 1227=>bumped  his  nose  on  the  pony's  neck.  Their  spirits  rose  as  they  went  down  and 
line 1228=>down. The  trees changed  to beech and oak, and hire was a comfortable  feeling  in 
line 1229=>the  twilight. The  last green had  almost  faded out of  the grass, when  they  came  at 
line 1230=>length to an open glade not far above the banks of the stream. 
line 1231=>
line 1232=>####-"Hrnmm!  it  smells  like  elves!"  thought  Bilbo,  and  he  looked  up  at  the  stars. 
line 1233=>They  were  burning  bright  and  blue.  Just  then  there  came  a  burst  of  song  like 
line 1234=>laughter in the trees: 
line 1235=> 
line 1236=>
line 1237=>O! What are you doing, 
line 1238=>And where are you going? 
line 1239=>Your ponies need shoeing! 
line 1240=>The river is flowing! 
line 1241=>O! tra-la-la-lally 
line 1242=>here down in the valley! 
line 1243=> 
line 1244=>O! What are you seeking, 
line 1245=>And where are you making? 
line 1246=>The faggots are reeking, 
line 1247=>The bannocks are baking! 
line 1248=>O! tril-lil-lil-lolly 
line 1249=>the valley is jolly,  
line 1250=>ha! ha! 
line 1251=> 
line 1252=>O! Where are you going 
line 1253=>With beards all a-wagging? 
line 1254=>No knowing, no knowing 
line 1255=>What brings Mister Baggins, 
line 1256=>And Balin and Dwalin  
line 1257=>down into the valley 
line 1258=>in June 
line 1259=>ha! ha! 
line 1260=> 
line 1261=>O! Will you be staying, 
line 1262=>Or will you be flying? 
line 1263=>Your ponies are straying! 
line 1264=>The daylight is dying! 
line 1265=>To fly would be folly,  
line 1266=>To stay would be jolly 
line 1267=>And listen and hark 
line 1268=>Till the end of the dark 
line 1269=>to our tune 
line 1270=>ha! ha.'  
line 1271=>
line 1272=> 
line 1273=>
line 1274=>####-So  they  laughed  and  sang  in  the  trees;  and  pretty  fair  nonsense  I  daresay  you 
line 1275=>think  it. Not  that  they would  care  they would only  laugh  all  the more  if you  told 
line 1276=>them  so.  They  were  elves  of  course.  Soon  Bilbo  caught  glimpses  of  them  as  the 
line 1277=>darkness deepened. He loved elves, though he seldom met them; but he was a little 
line 1278=>frightened of  them  too. Dwarves don't get on well with  them. Even decent enough 
line 1279=>dwarves  like  Thorin  and  his  friends  think  them  foolish  (which  is  a  very  foolish 
line 1280=>thing to think), or get annoyed with them. For some elves tease them and laugh at 
line 1281=>them, and most of all at their beards. 
line 1282=>"Well,  well!"  said  a  voice.  "Just  look!  Bilbo  the  hobbit  on  a  pony,  my  dear! 
line 1283=>Isn't it delicious!" 
line 1284=>"Most astonishing wonderful!" 
line 1285=>Then  off  they  went  into  another  song  as  ridiculous  as  the  one  I  have  written 
line 1286=>down  in  full. At  last one, a  tall young  fellow, came out  from  the  trees and bowed 
line 1287=>to Gandalf and to Thorin. 
line 1288=>"Welcome to the valley!" he said. 
line 1289=>"Thank you!"  said Thorin a bit gruffly; but Gandalf was already off his horse 
line 1290=>and among the elves, talking merrily with them. 
line 1291=>"You  are  a  little  out  of  your way,"  said  the  elf:  "that  is,  if  you  are making for 
line 1292=>the only path across the water and to the house beyond. We will set you right, but 
line 1293=>you had best get on foot, until you are over the bridge. Are you going to stay a bit 
line 1294=>and  sing  with  us,  or  will  you  go  straight  on?  Supper  is  preparing  over  there," he 
line 1295=>said. "I can smell the Wood-fires for the cooking." 
line 1296=>Tired as he was, Bilbo would have liked to stay awhile. Elvish singing is not a 
line 1297=>thing  to  miss,  in  June  under  the  stars,  not  if  you  care  for  such  things.  Also  he 
line 1298=>would  have  liked  to  have  a  few  private  words  with  these  people  that  seemed  to 
line 1299=>know  his  name  and  all  about  him,  although  he  had  never  been  them  before.  He 
line 1300=>thought  their  opinion  of  his  adventure might  be  interesting. Elves  know  a  lot  and 
line 1301=>are wondrous  folk  for news, and know what  is going on among the peoples of the 
line 1302=>land,  as  quick  as water  flows,  or  quicker. But  the  dwarves were  all  for  supper  as 
line 1303=>soon  'as  possible  just  then,  and  would  not  stay.  On  they  all  went,  leading  their 
line 1304=>ponies, till they were brought to a good path and so at last to the very brink of the 
line 1305=>river.  It  was  flowing  fast  and  noisily,  as  mountain-streams  do  of  a  summer 
line 1306=>evening, when  sun  has  been  all  day  on  the  snow  far  up  above.  There was  only  a 
line 1307=>narrow bridge of stone without a parapet, as narrow as a pony could well walk on; 
line 1308=>and  over  that  they had  to go, slow and careful, one by one, each  leading his pony 
line 1309=>by  the  bridle. The  elves  had  brought  bright  lanterns  to  the  shore,  and  they  sang  a 
line 1310=>merry song as the party went across. 
line 1311=>
line 1312=>####-"Don't dip your beard in the foam, father!" they cried to Thorin, who was bent 
line 1313=>almost on to his hands and knees. "It is long enough without watering it." 
line 1314=>"Mind  Bilbo  doesn't  eat  all  the  cakes!"  they  called.  "He  is  too  fat  to  get 
line 1315=>through key-holes yet!" 
line 1316=>"Hush,  hush!  Good  People!  and  good  night!"  said  Gandalf,  who  came  last. 
line 1317=>"Valleys have ears, and some elves have over merry tongues. Good night!" 
line 1318=>And  so  at  last  they  all  came  to  the  Last  Homely  House,  and  found  its  doors 
line 1319=>flung wide. 
line 1320=>Now  it  is  a  strange  thing,  but  things  that  are  good  to  have  and  days  that  are 
line 1321=>good  to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are 
line 1322=>uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a 
line 1323=>deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days at least, 
line 1324=>and  they  found  it  hard  to  leave.  Bilbo  would  gladly  have  stopped  there  for  ever 
line 1325=>and  ever-even  supposing  a  wish  would  have  taken  him  right  back  to  his  hobbit-
line 1326=>hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay.  
line 1327=>The  master  of  the  house  was  an  elf-friend-one  of  those  people whose  fathers 
line 1328=>came  into  the  strange  stories  before  the  beginning  of History,  the wars  of  the  evil 
line 1329=>goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our tale there 
line 1330=>were  still  some  people who  had  both  elves  and  heroes  of  the North  for ancestors, 
line 1331=>and Elrond the master of the house was their chief. He was as noble and as fair in 
line 1332=>face  as  an  elf-lord,  as  strong  as  a warrior,  as wise  as  a wizard,  as  venerable  as  a 
line 1333=>king  of  dwarves,  and  as  kind  as  summer. He  comes  into. many  tales, but his part 
line 1334=>in  the  story  of  Bilbo's  great  adventure  is  only  a  small  one,  though  important,  as 
line 1335=>you  will  see,  if  we  ever  get  to  the  end  of  it.  His  house  was  perfect,  whether  you 
line 1336=>liked  food,  or  sleep,  or  work,  or  story-telling,  or  singing,  or  just  sitting  and 
line 1337=>thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them all. Evil things did not come into that 
line 1338=>valley.  
line 1339=>I wish I had  time  to  tell you even a few of  the  tales or one or  two of  the songs 
line 1340=>that  they  heard  in  that  house. All  of  them,  the  ponies  as well,  grew  refreshed and 
line 1341=>strong  in  a  few  days  there.  Their  clothes  were  mended  as  well  as  their  bruises, 
line 1342=>their tempers and their hopes. Their bags were filled with food and provisions light 
line 1343=>to  carry  but  strong  to  bring  them  over  the  mountain  passes.  Their  plans  were 
line 1344=>improved  with  the  best  advice.  So  the  time  came  to  mid-  summer  eve,  and  they 
line 1345=>were to go on again with the early sun on midsummer morning. 
line 1346=>Elrond  knew  all  about  runes  of  every  kind. That  day  he  looked  at  the  swords 
line 1347=>they had brought from the trolls' lair, and he said: "These are not troll-make. They 
line 1348=>are old swords, very old swords of the High Elves of the West, my kin. They were 
line 1349=>
line 1350=>####-made  in  Gondolin  for  the  Goblin-wars.  They  must  have  come  from  a  dragon's 
line 1351=>hoard  or  goblin  plunder,  for  dragons  and  goblins  destroyed  that  city  many  ages 
line 1352=>ago.  This,  Thorin,  the  runes  name  Orcrist,  the  Goblin-cleaver  in  the  ancient 
line 1353=>tongue  of  Gondolin;  it  was  a  famous  blade.  This,  Gandalf,  was  Glamdring,  Foe-
line 1354=>hammer that the king of Gondolin once wore. Keep them well!" 
line 1355=>"Whence  did  the  trolls  get  them,  I wonder?"  said Thorin  looking at his  sword 
line 1356=>with new interest. 
line 1357=>"I  could  not  say,"  said  Elrond,  "but  one  may  guess  that  your  trolls  had 
line 1358=>plundered other plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hold 
line 1359=>in  the mountains  of  the North.  I  have heard  that  there are  still  forgotten  treasures 
line 1360=>of  old  to  be  found  in  the  deserted  caverns  of  the mines  of Moria,  since  the  dwarf 
line 1361=>and goblin war." 
line 1362=>Thorin  pondered  these  words.  "I  will  keep  this  sword  in  honour,"  he  said. 
line 1363=>"May it soon cleave goblins once again!" 
line 1364=>"A  wish  that  is  likely  to  be  granted  soon  enough  in  the  mountains!"  said 
line 1365=>Elrond.  "But  show  me  now  your  map!"  He  took  it  and  gazed  long  at  it,  and  he 
line 1366=>shook  his  head;  for  if  he  did  not  altogether  approve  of  dwarves  and  their  love  of 
line 1367=>gold, he hated dragons and their cruel wickedness, and he grieved to remember the 
line 1368=>ruin  of  the  town  of  Dale  and  its  merry  bells,  and  the  burned  banks  of  the  bright 
line 1369=>River Running. The moon was  shining  in  a  broad  silver  crescent. He  held  up  the 
line 1370=>map  and  the  white  light  shone  through  it.  "What  is  this?"  he  said.  "There  are 
line 1371=>moon-letters  here,  beside  the  plain  runes  which  say  'five  feet  high  the  door  and 
line 1372=>three may walk abreast.' " 
line 1373=>"What  are moon-letters?" asked  the hobbit  full of excitement. He  loved maps, 
line 1374=>as  I  have  told  you  before;  and  he  also  liked  runes  and  letters  and  cunning 
line 1375=>handwriting, though when he wrote himself it was a bit thin and spidery.  
line 1376=>"Moon-letters  are  rune-letters,  but  you  cannot  see  them,"  said  Elrond,  "not 
line 1377=>when  you  look  straight  at  them.  They  can  only  be  seen  when  the  moon  shines 
line 1378=>behind  them,  and what  is more, with  the more  cunning  sort  it must  be  a moon  of 
line 1379=>the  same  shape  and  season  as  the  day  when  they  were  written.  The  dwarves 
line 1380=>invented  them  and  wrote  them  with  silver  pens,  as  your  friends  could  tell  you. 
line 1381=>These  must  have  been  written  on  a midsummer's  eve  in  a  crescent moon,  a  long 
line 1382=>while ago." 
line 1383=>"What  do  they  say?"  asked Gandalf  and Thorin  together,  a  bit  vexed  perhaps 
line 1384=>that even Elrond should have found this out first, though really there had not been 
line 1385=>a  chance  before,  and  there  would  not  have  been  another  until  goodness  knows 
line 1386=>when. 
line 1387=>
line 1388=>####-"Stand  by  the  grey  stone  when  the  thrush  knocks,"  read  Elrond,  "and  the 
line 1389=>setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the key-hole." 
line 1390=>"Durin,  Durin!"  said  Thorin.  "He  was  the  father  of  the  fathers  of  the  eldest 
line 1391=>race of Dwarves, the Longbeards, and my first ancestor: I am his heir." 
line 1392=>"Then what is Durin's Day?" asked Elrond. 
line 1393=>"The  first day of  the dwarves' New Year," said Thorin, "is as all should know 
line 1394=>the first, day of the last moon of Autumn on the threshold of Winter. We still call it 
line 1395=>Durin's  Day  when  the  last  moon  of  Autumn  and  the  sun  are  in  the  sky  together. 
line 1396=>But this will not help us much, I fear, for it passes our skill in these days to guess 
line 1397=>when such a time will come again." 
line 1398=>"That remains to be seen," said Gandalf. "Is there any more writing?" 
line 1399=>"None  to  be  seen  by  this  moon,"  said  Elrond,  and  he  gave  the  map  back  to 
line 1400=>Thorin; and then they went down to the water to see the elves dance and sing upon 
line 1401=>the midsummer's eve. 
line 1402=>The  next  morning  was  a  midsummer's  morning  as  fair  and  fresh  as  could  be 
line 1403=>dreamed: blue sky and never a cloud, and the sun dancing on the water. Now they 
line 1404=>rode away amid songs of farewell and good speed, with their hearts ready for more 
line 1405=>adventure,  and  with  a  knowledge  of  the  road  they  must  follow  over  the  Misty 
line 1406=>Mountains to the land beyond. 
line 1407=>
line 1408=>####-<h4>Chapter 4 </h4> <br>
line 1409=>
line 1410=>Over Hill and Under Hill 
line 1411=>
line 1412=> 
line 1413=>There  were  many  paths  that  led  up  into  those  mountains,  and  many  passes 
line 1414=>over them. But most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to 
line 1415=>bad ends; and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers. 
line 1416=>The  dwarves  and  the  hobbit,  helped  by  the  wise  advice  of  Elrond  and  the 
line 1417=>knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass. 
line 1418=>Long  days  after  they  had  climbed  out  of  the  valley  and  left  the  Last  Homely 
line 1419=>House  miles  behind,  they  were  still  going  up  and  up  and  up.  It  was  a  hard  path 
line 1420=>and  a  dangerous  path,  a  crooked  way  and  a  lonely  and  a  long.  Now  they  could 
line 1421=>look  back  over  the  lands  they  had  left,  laid  out  behind  them  far  below.  Far,  far 
line 1422=>away in the West, where things were blue and faint, Bilbo knew there lay his own 
line 1423=>country  of  safe  and  comfortable  things,  and  his  little  hobbit-hole. He shivered.  It 
line 1424=>was  getting  bitter  cold  up  here,  and  the  wind  came  shrill  among  the  rocks. 
line 1425=>Boulders,  too,  at  times  came  galloping  down  the  mountain-sides,  let  loose  by 
line 1426=>midday  sun  upon  the  snow,  and  passed  among  them  (which  was  lucky),  or  over 
line 1427=>their heads (which was alarming). The nights were comfortless and chill, and they 
line 1428=>did not dare  to sing or  talk  too  loud,  for  the echoes were uncanny, and  the silence 
line 1429=>seemed  to  dislike  being  broken-except by  the noise of water and  the wail of wind 
line 1430=>and the crack of stone. 
line 1431=>"The  summer  is  getting  on  down  below,"  thought  Bilbo,  "and  haymaking  is 
line 1432=>going  on  and  picnics. They will  be  harvesting  and  blackberrying,  before we  even 
line 1433=>begin to go down the other side at this rate." And the others were thinking equally 
line 1434=>gloomy  thoughts,  although  when  they  had  said  good-bye  to  Elrond  in  the  high 
line 1435=>hope  of  a  midsummer  morning,  they'  had  spoken  gaily  of  the  passage  of  the 
line 1436=>mountains,  and  of  riding  swift  across  the  lands  beyond.  They  had  thought  of 
line 1437=>coming  to  the  secret  door  in  the  Lonely  Mountain,  perhaps  that  very  next  first 
line 1438=>moon  of  Autumn—"  and  perhaps  it  will  be  Durin's  Day"  they  had  said.  Only 
line 1439=>Gandalf had  shaken his head  and  said nothing. Dwarves had not passed  that way 
line 1440=>for  many  years,  but  Gandalf  had,  and  he  knew  how  evil  and  danger  had  grown 
line 1441=>and  thriven  in  the Wild, since  the dragons had driven men from the lands, and the 
line 1442=>goblins had spread  in secret after  the battle of  the Mines of Moria. Even  the good 
line 1443=>plans  of  wise  wizards  like  Gandalf  and  of  good  friends  like  Elrond  go  astray 
line 1444=>sometimes when  you  are  off  on  dangerous  adventures  over  the Edge  of  the Wild; 
line 1445=>and Gandalf was a wise enough wizard to know it. 
line 1446=>
line 1447=>####-He  knew  that  something  unexpected  might  happen,  and  he  hardly  dared  to 
line 1448=>hope  that  they  would  pass  without  fearful  adventure  over  those  great  tall 
line 1449=>mountains  with  lonely  peaks  and  valleys  where  no  king  ruled. They did not. All 
line 1450=>was  well,  until  one  day  they  met  a  thunderstorm  -  more  than  a  thunderstorm,  a 
line 1451=>thunder-battle.  You  know  how  terrific  a  really  big  thunderstorm  can  be  down  in 
line 1452=>the  land  and  in  a  river-valley;  especially  at  times  when  two  great  thunderstorms 
line 1453=>meet  and  clash. More  terrible  still  are  thunder  and  lightning  in  the  mountains  at 
line 1454=>night,  when  storms  come  up  from  East  and  West  and  make  war.  The  lightning 
line 1455=>splinters  on  the  peaks,  and  rocks  shiver,  and  great  crashes  split  the  air  and  go 
line 1456=>rolling  and  tumbling  into  every  cave  and  hollow;  and  the  darkness  is  filled  with 
line 1457=>overwhelming noise and sudden light. 
line 1458=>Bilbo had never seen or imagined anything of the kind. They were high up in a 
line 1459=>narrow place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them. There they 
line 1460=>were  sheltering  under  a  hanging  rock  for  the  night,  and  he  lay  beneath  a  blanket 
line 1461=>and  shook  from  head  to  toe. When  he  peeped  out  in  the  lightning-flashes, he saw 
line 1462=>that  across  the  valley  the  stone-giants  were  out  and  were  hurling  rocks  at  one 
line 1463=>another  for a. game, and catching  them, and  tossing  them down  into  the darkness 
line 1464=>where  they  smashed among  the  trees  far below, or  splintered  into  little bits with a 
line 1465=>bang.  Then  came  a  wind  and  a  rain,  and  the  wind  whipped  the  rain  and  the  hail 
line 1466=>about  in  every  direction,  so  that  an  overhanging  rock  was  no  protection  at  all. 
line 1467=>Soon  they were  getting  drenched  and  their  ponies were  standing with  their  heads 
line 1468=>down  and  their  tails  between  their  legs,  and  some  of  them  were  whinnying  with 
line 1469=>fright.  They  could  hear  the  giants  guffawing  and  shouting  all  over  the 
line 1470=>mountainsides. 
line 1471=>"This won't  do  at  all!"  said Thorin.  "If we  don't  get  blown  off  or  drowned,  or 
line 1472=>struck by lightning, we shall be picked up by some giant and kicked sky-high for a 
line 1473=>football." 
line 1474=>"Well,  if  you  know  of  anywhere  better, take us there!" said Gandalf, who was 
line 1475=>feeling very grumpy, and was far from happy about the giants himself. 
line 1476=>The  end of  their  argument was  that  they  sent Fill  and Kili  to  look  for  a better 
line 1477=>shelter. They had very sharp eyes, and being the youngest of the dwarves by some 
line 1478=>fifty  years  they  usually  got  these  sort  of  jobs  (when  everybody  could  see  that  it 
line 1479=>was  absolutely  no  use  sending Bilbo). There  is  nothing  like  looking,  if  you want 
line 1480=>to find something (or so Thorin said to the young dwarves). You certainly usually 
line 1481=>find  something,  if  you  look,  but  it  is  not  always  quite  the  something  you  were 
line 1482=>after. So it proved on this occasion. 
line 1483=>
line 1484=>####-Soon  Fili  and  Kili  came  crawling  back,  holding  on  to  the  rocks  in  the  wind. 
line 1485=>"We have  found a dry cave,"  they said, "not  far  round  the next corner; and ponies 
line 1486=>and all could get inside." 
line 1487=>"Have  you  thoroughly  explored  it?"  said  the wizard, who  knew  that  caves  up 
line 1488=>in the mountains were seldom unoccupied. 
line 1489=>"Yes,  yes!"  they  said,  though  everybody  knew  they  could  not  have  been  long 
line 1490=>about  it;  they had come back too quick. "It isn't all that big, and it does not go far 
line 1491=>back." 
line 1492=>That,  of  course,  is  the  dangerous  part  about  caves:  you  don't  know  how  far 
line 1493=>they  go  back,  sometimes,  or  where  a  passage  behind  may  lead  to,  or  what  is 
line 1494=>waiting for you inside. But now Fili and Kill's news seemed good enough. So they 
line 1495=>all  got  up  and  prepared  to  move.  The  wind  was  howling  and  the  thunder  still 
line 1496=>growling, and  they had a business getting  themselves and  their ponies along. Still 
line 1497=>it was not very far to go, and before long they came to a big rock standing out into 
line 1498=>the path. If you stepped behind, you found a low arch in the side of the mountain. 
line 1499=>There was just room to get the ponies through with a squeeze, when they had been 
line 1500=>unpacked  and  unsaddled.  As  they  passed  under  the  arch,  it was  good  to  hear  the 
line 1501=>wind and the rain outside instead of all about them, and to feel safe from the giants 
line 1502=>and their rocks. But the wizard was taking no risks. He lit up his wand  - as he did 
line 1503=>that  day  in Bilbo's  dining-room  that  seemed  so  long ago,  if you remember—, and 
line 1504=>by its light they explored the cave from end to end. 
line 1505=>It seemed quite a fair size, but not  too  large and mysterious. It had a dry floor 
line 1506=>and some comfortable nooks. At one end there was room for the ponies; and there 
line 1507=>they stood (mighty glad of the change) steaming, and champing in their nosebags. 
line 1508=>Oin  and Gloin wanted  to  light  a  fire  at  the  door  to  dry  their  clothes,  but Gandalf 
line 1509=>would not hear of  it. So  they  spread out  their wet  things on  the  floor, and got dry 
line 1510=>ones out of  their bundles;  then they made their blankets comfortable, got out their 
line 1511=>pipes  and  blew  smoke  rings,  which  Gandalf  turned  into  different  colours  and  set 
line 1512=>dancing  up  by  the  roof  to  amuse  them.  They  talked  and  talked,  and  forgot  about 
line 1513=>the  storm, and discussed what each would  do with his share of the treasure (when 
line 1514=>they got it, which at the moment did not seem so impossible); and so they dropped 
line 1515=>off  to  sleep  one  by  one.  And  that  was  the  last  time  that  they  used  the  ponies, 
line 1516=>packages, baggages, tools and paraphernalia that they had brought with them. 
line 1517=>It  turned  out  a  good  thing  that  night  that  they  had  brought  little  Bilbo  with 
line 1518=>them, after all. For somehow, he could not go  to sleep for a  long while; and when 
line 1519=>he did sleep, he had very nasty dreams. He dreamed that a crack in the wall at the 
line 1520=>back  of  the  cave  got  bigger  and  bigger,  and  opened wider  and wider,  and  he was 
line 1521=>
line 1522=>####-very  afraid  but  could  not  call  out  or  do  anything  but  lie  and  look.  Then  he 
line 1523=>dreamed  that  the floor of  the cave was giving way, and he was slipping-beginning 
line 1524=>to fall down, down, goodness knows where to. 
line 1525=>At  that he woke up with a horrible start, and found  that part of his dream was 
line 1526=>true. A crack had opened at the back of the cave, and was already a wide passage. 
line 1527=>He  was  just  in  time  to  see  the  last  of  the  ponies'  tails  disappearing  into  it.  Of 
line 1528=>course  he  gave  a  very  loud  yell,  as  loud  a  yell  as  a  hobbit  can  give,  which  is 
line 1529=>surprising for their size. 
line 1530=>Out  jumped  the  goblins,  big  goblins,  great  ugly-looking  goblins,  lots  of 
line 1531=>goblins,  before  you  could  say  rocks  and  blocks.  There were  six  to each dwarf, at 
line 1532=>least,  and  two  even  for Bilbo;  and  they were  all  grabbed  and  carried  through  the 
line 1533=>crack,  before  you  could  say  tinder  and  flint.  But  not  Gandalf.  Bilbo's  yell  had 
line 1534=>done  that  much  good.  It  had  wakened  him  up  wide  in  a  splintered  second,  and 
line 1535=>when  goblins  came  to  grab  him,  there  was  a  terrible  flash  like  lightning  in  the 
line 1536=>cave, a smell like gunpowder, and several of them fell dead. 
line 1537=>The  crack  closed with  a  snap,  and  Bilbo  and  the  dwarves were  on  the wrong 
line 1538=>side  of  it! Where was Gandalf? Of  that neither they nor the goblins had any idea, 
line 1539=>and  the  goblins  did  not  wait  to  find  out.  It  was  deep,  deep,  dark,  such  as  only 
line 1540=>goblins  that  have  taken  to  living  in  the  heart  of  the  mountains  can  see  through. 
line 1541=>The  passages  there  were  crossed  and  tangled  in  all  directions,  but  the  goblins 
line 1542=>knew  their  way,  as  well  as  you  do  to  the  nearest  post-office;  and  the  way  went 
line 1543=>down and down, and it was most horribly stuffy. The goblins were very rough, and 
line 1544=>pinched  unmercifully,  and  chuckled  and  laughed  in  their  horrible  stony  voices; 
line 1545=>and Bilbo was more  unhappy  even  than when  the  troll  had  picked  him  up  by  his 
line 1546=>toes.  He  wished  again  and  again  for  his  nice  bright  hobbit-hole. Not  for  the  last 
line 1547=>time. 
line 1548=>Now  there  came  a  glimmer  of  a  red  light  before  them.  The  goblins  began  to 
line 1549=>sing,  or  croak,  keeping  time  with  the  flap  of  their  flat  feet  on  the  stone,  and 
line 1550=>shaking their prisoners as well. 
line 1551=> 
line 1552=>
line 1553=>Clap! Snap! the black crack! 
line 1554=>Grip, grab! Pinch, nab! 
line 1555=>And down down to Goblin -town  
line 1556=>You go, my lad! 
line 1557=> 
line 1558=>Clash, crash! Crush, smash! 
line 1559=>Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs! 
line 1560=>Pound, pound, far underground! 
line 1561=>
line 1562=>####-Ho, ho! my lad! 
line 1563=> 
line 1564=>Swish, smack! Whip crack! 
line 1565=>Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat! 
line 1566=>Work, work! Nor dare to shirk, 
line 1567=>While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh, 
line 1568=>Round and round far underground 
line 1569=>Below, my lad! 
line 1570=>
line 1571=> 
line 1572=>It  sounded  truly  terrifying. The walls  echoed  to  the  clap,  snap!  and  the  crush, 
line 1573=>smash!  and  to  the  ugly  laughter  of  their  ho,  ho! my  lad! The  general meaning  of 
line 1574=>the song was only too plain; for now the goblins took out whips and whipped them 
line 1575=>with  a  swish,  smack!,  and set them running as fast as they could in front of them; 
line 1576=>and  more  than  one  of  the  dwarves  were  already  yammering  and  bleating  like 
line 1577=>anything, when they stumbled into a big cavern. 
line 1578=>It was  lit by a great red fire  in  the middle, and by  torches along  the walls, and 
line 1579=>it  was  full  of  goblins.  They  all  laughed  and  stamped  and  clapped  their  hands, 
line 1580=>when  the  dwarves  (with  poor  little  Bilbo  at  the  back  and  nearest  to  the  whips) 
line 1581=>came  running  in,  while  the  goblin-drivers  whooped  and  cracked  their  whips 
line 1582=>behind. The  ponies were already  there huddled  in a corner; and  there were all  the 
line 1583=>baggages  and  packages  lying  broken  open,  and  being  rummaged  by  goblins,  and 
line 1584=>smelt by goblins, and fingered by goblins, and quarreled over by goblins. 
line 1585=>I  am  afraid  that  was  the  last  they  ever  saw  of  those  excellent  little  ponies, 
line 1586=>including  a  jolly  sturdy  little  white  fellow  that  Elrond  had  lent  to  Gandalf,  since 
line 1587=>his  horse  was  not  suitable  for  the  mountain-paths.  For  goblins  eat  horses  and 
line 1588=>ponies  and  donkeys  (and  other much more  dreadful  things),  and  they are always 
line 1589=>hungry.  Just  now  however  the  prisoners  were  thinking  only  of  themselves.  The 
line 1590=>goblins  chained  their  hands  behind  their  backs  and  linked  them  all  together  in  a 
line 1591=>line  and dragged  them  to  the  far  end of  the  cavern with  little Bilbo  tugging  at the 
line 1592=>end of the row.  
line 1593=>There in the shadows on a large flat stone sat a tremendous goblin with a huge 
line 1594=>head,  and  armed  goblins were  standing  round  him  carrying  the  axes  and  the  bent 
line 1595=>swords that they use. Now goblins are cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted. They make 
line 1596=>no beautiful things, but they make many clever ones. They can tunnel and mine as 
line 1597=>well as any but the most skilled dwarves, when they take the trouble, though they 
line 1598=>are  usually  untidy  and  dirty.  Hammers,  axes,  swords,  daggers,  pickaxes,  tongs, 
line 1599=>and  also  instruments of  torture,  they make very well, or get other people  to make 
line 1600=>to  their design, prisoners and  slaves  that have  to work  till  they die  for want of air 
line 1601=>
line 1602=>####-and light. It is not unlikely that they invented some of the machines that have since 
line 1603=>troubled  the  world,  especially  the  ingenious  devices  for  killing  large  numbers  of 
line 1604=>people at once, for wheels and engines and explosions always delighted them, and 
line 1605=>also  not  working  with  their  own  hands  more  than  they  could  help;  but  in  those 
line 1606=>days  and  those  wild  parts  they had not  advanced  (as  it  is  called)  so  far. They did 
line 1607=>not  hate  dwarves  especially,  no  more  than  they  hated  everybody  and  everything, 
line 1608=>and  particularly  the  orderly  and  prosperous;  in  some  parts  wicked  dwarves  had 
line 1609=>even  made  alliances  with  them.  But  they  had  a  special  grudge  against  Thorin's 
line 1610=>people,  because  of  the war which  you  have  heard mentioned,  but which  does  not 
line 1611=>come  into  this  tale; and anyway goblins don't care who  they catch, as  long as  it  is 
line 1612=>done smart and secret, and the prisoners are not able to defend themselves. 
line 1613=>"Who are these miserable persons?" said the Great Goblin. 
line 1614=>"Dwarves, and this!" said one of the drivers, pulling at Bilbo's chain so that he 
line 1615=>fell forward onto his knees. 
line 1616=>"We found them sheltering in our Front Porch." 
line 1617=>"What do you mean by it?" said the Great Goblin turning to Thorin. "Up to no 
line 1618=>good, I'll warrant! Spying on the private business of my people, I guess! Thieves, I 
line 1619=>shouldn't  be  surprised  to  learn!  Murderers  and  friends  of  Elves,  not  unlikely! 
line 1620=>Come! What have you got to say?" 
line 1621=>"Thorin  the  dwarf  at  your  service!"  he  replied-it was merely a polite nothing. 
line 1622=>"Of the things which you suspect and imagine we had no idea at all. We sheltered 
line 1623=>from  a  storm  in what  seemed  a  convenient  cave  and  unused;  nothing was  further 
line 1624=>from  our  thoughts  than  inconveniencing goblins  in any way whatever." That was 
line 1625=>true enough! 
line 1626=>"Urn!"  said  the Great Goblin.  "So you  say! Might  I  ask what you were doing 
line 1627=>up in the mountains at all, and where you were coming from, and where you were 
line 1628=>going to? In fact I should like to know all about you. Not that it willdo you much 
line 1629=>good,  Thorin  Oakenshield,  I  know  too  much  about  your  folk  already;  but  let's 
line 1630=>have the truth, or I will prepare something particularly uncomfortable for you!" 
line 1631=>"We were on a journey to visit our relatives, our nephews and nieces, and first, 
line 1632=>second, and third cousins, and the other descendants of our grandfathers, who live 
line 1633=>on  the  East  side  of  these  truly  hospitable  mountains,"  said  Thorin,  not  quite 
line 1634=>knowing  what  to  say  all  at  once  in  a  moment,  when  obviously  the  exact  truth 
line 1635=>would not do at all. 
line 1636=>"He is a liar, O truly tremendous one!" said one of the drivers. "Several of our 
line 1637=>people  were  struck  by  lightning  in  the  cave,  when  we  invited  these  creatures  to 
line 1638=>come  below;  and  they  are  as  dead  as  stones. Also  he  has  not  explained  this!" He 
line 1639=>
line 1640=>####-held out the sword which Thorin had worn, the sword which came from the Trolls' 
line 1641=>lair.  
line 1642=>The Great Goblin gave a truly awful howl of rage when he looked at it, and all 
line 1643=>his soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped. They knew the 
line 1644=>sword at once.  It had killed hundreds of goblins  in  its  time, when  the  fair elves of 
line 1645=>Gondolin hunted them in the hills or did battle before their walls. They had called 
line 1646=>it Orcrist, Goblin-cleaver, but the goblins called it simply Biter. They hated it and 
line 1647=>hated worse any one that carried it. 
line 1648=>"Murderers'  and  elf-friends!"  the  Great  Goblin  shouted.  "Slash  them!  Beat 
line 1649=>them! Bite  them! Gnash  them! Take  them  away  to  dark  holes  full  of  snakes,  and 
line 1650=>never  let  them  see  the  light  again!" He was  in  such  a  rage  that he  jumped off his 
line 1651=>seat and himself rushed at Thorin with his mouth open. 
line 1652=>Just  at  that  moment  all  the  lights  in  the  cavern  went  out,  and  the  great  fire 
line 1653=>went  off  poof!  into  a  tower  of  blue  glowing  smoke,  right  up  to  the  roof,  that 
line 1654=>scattered piercing white sparks all among the goblins. 
line 1655=>The  yells  and  yammering,  croaking,  jibbering  and  jabbering;  howls,  growls 
line 1656=>and curses; shrieking and skriking, that followed were beyond description. Several 
line 1657=>hundred wild  cats  and wolves being  roasted  slowly  alive  together would not have 
line 1658=>compared  with  it.  The  sparks  were  burning  holes  in  the  goblins,  and  the  smoke 
line 1659=>that  now  fell  from  the  roof  made  the  air  too  thick  for  even  their  eyes  to  see 
line 1660=>through. Soon they were falling over one another and rolling in heaps on the floor, 
line 1661=>biting and kicking and fighting as if they had all gone mad. 
line 1662=>Suddenly  a  sword  flashed  in  its  own  light.  Bilbo  saw  it  go  right  through  the 
line 1663=>Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage. He fell dead, and 
line 1664=>the goblin soldiers fled before the sword shrieking into the darkness. 
line 1665=>The  sword  went  back  into  its  sheath.  "Follow  me  quick!"  said  a  voice  fierce 
line 1666=>and  quiet;  and  before Bilbo  understood what  had  happened  he was  trotting  along 
line 1667=>again, as fast as he could trot, at the end of the line, down more dark passages with 
line 1668=>the  yells  of  the  goblin-hall  growing  fainter  behind  him.  A  pale  light  was  leading 
line 1669=>them on. 
line 1670=>"Quicker, quicker!" said the voice. "The torches will soon be relit." 
line 1671=>"Half  a  minute!"  said  Dori,  who  was  at  the  back  next  to  Bilbo,  and  a  decent 
line 1672=>fellow.  He  made  the  hobbit  scramble  on  his  shoulders  as  best  he  could  with  his 
line 1673=>tied  hands,  and  then  off  they  all  went  at  a  run,  with  a  clink-clink  of  chains,  and 
line 1674=>many a stumble, since they had no hands to steady themselves with. Not for a long 
line 1675=>while did  they  stop,  and by  that  time  they must have been  right down  in  the very 
line 1676=>mountain's heart. 
line 1677=>
line 1678=>####-Then  Gandalf  lit  up  his  wand.  Of  course  it  was  Gandalf;  but  just  then  they 
line 1679=>were  too busy  to ask how he got  there. He  took out his  sword again, and again  it 
line 1680=>flashed  in  the  dark  by  itself.  It  burned  with  a  rage  that  made  it  gleam  if  goblins 
line 1681=>were  about; now  it was bright  as blue  flame  for delight  in  the killing of  the great 
line 1682=>lord of the cave. It made no trouble whatever of cutting through the goblin-chains 
line 1683=>and  setting  all  the  prisoners  free  as  quickly  as  possible.  This  sword's  name  was 
line 1684=>Glamdring  the  Foe-hammer,  if  you  remember.  The  goblins  just  called  it  Beater, 
line 1685=>and hated it worse than Biter if possible. Orcrist, too, had been saved; for Gandalf 
line 1686=>had brought it along as well, snatching it from one of the terrified guards. Gandalf 
line 1687=>thought of most things; and though he could not do everything, he could do a great 
line 1688=>deal for friends in a tight comer.  
line 1689=>"Are we all here?" said he, handing his sword back to Thorin with a bow. "Let 
line 1690=>me see: one-that's Thorin; two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven; 
line 1691=>where  are  Fili  and  Kili?  Here  they  are,  twelve,  thirteen-and  here's Mr.  Baggins: 
line 1692=>fourteen!  Well,  well!  it  might  be  worse,  and  then  again  it  might  be  a  good  deal 
line 1693=>better. No ponies, and no food, and no knowing quite where we are, and hordes of 
line 1694=>angry goblins just behind! On we go!" 
line 1695=>On  they  went.  Gandalf  was  quite  right:  they  began  to  hear  goblin  noises  and 
line 1696=>horrible cries far behind in the passages they had come through. That sent them on 
line 1697=>faster  than  ever,  and  as  poor Bilbo  could  not  possibly  go  half  as  fast-for dwarves 
line 1698=>can roll along at a tremendous pace, I can tell you, when they have to-they took it 
line 1699=>in turn to carry him on their backs. 
line 1700=>Still  goblins  go  faster  than  dwarves,  and  these  goblins  knew  the  way  better 
line 1701=>(they had made the paths themselves), and were madly angry; so that do what they 
line 1702=>could  the  dwarves  heard  the  cries  and  howls  getting  closer  and  closer.  Soon  they 
line 1703=>could  hear  even  the  flap  of  the  goblin  feet,  many  many  feet which  seemed  only 
line 1704=>just  round  the  last  corner.  The  blink  of  red  torches  could  be  seen  behind  them  in 
line 1705=>the tunnel they were following; and they were getting deadly tired. 
line 1706=>"Why,  O  why  did  I  ever  leave  my  hobbit-hole!"  said  poor  Mr.  Baggins 
line 1707=>bumping up and down on Bombur's back. 
line 1708=>"Why, O why did I ever bring a wretched little hobbit on a treasure hunt!" said 
line 1709=>poor Bombur, who was fat, and staggered along with the sweat dripping down his 
line 1710=>nose in his heat and terror.  
line 1711=>At  this  point  Gandalf  fell  behind,  and  Thorin  with  him.  They  turned  a  sharp 
line 1712=>corner. "About turn!" he shouted. "Draw your sword, Thorin!" 
line 1713=>There was nothing else  to be done; and  the goblins did not  like  it. They came 
line 1714=>scurrying  round  the corner  in  full cry, and  found Goblin-cleaver and Foe-hammer 
line 1715=>
line 1716=>####-shining  cold  and  bright  right  in  their  astonished  eyes.  The  ones  in  front  dropped 
line 1717=>their  torches  and  gave  one  yell  before  they  were  killed.  The  ones  behind  yelled 
line 1718=>still  more,  and  leaped  back  knocking  over  those  that  were  running  after  them. 
line 1719=>"Biter  and Beater!"  they  shrieked;  and  soon  they were  all  in  confusion,  and most 
line 1720=>of them were hustling back the way they had come. 
line 1721=>It was quite a  long while before any of  them dared  to  turn  that comer. By  that 
line 1722=>time the dwarves had gone on again, a long, long, way on into the dark tunnels of 
line 1723=>the  goblins'  realm.  When  the  goblins  discovered  that,  they  put  out  their  torches 
line 1724=>and they slipped on soft shoes, and they chose out their very quickest runners with 
line 1725=>the sharpest ears and eyes. These ran forward, as swift as weasels in the dark,  and 
line 1726=>with hardly any more noise than bats. 
line 1727=>That  is  why  neither  Bilbo,  nor  the  dwarves,  nor  even  Gandalf  heard  them 
line 1728=>coming. Nor did they see them. But they were seen by the goblins that ran silently 
line 1729=>up  behind,  for  Gandalf  was  letting  his  wand  give  out  a  faint  light  to  help  the 
line 1730=>dwarves as they went along. 
line 1731=>Quite suddenly Dori, now at the back again carrying Bilbo, was grabbed from 
line 1732=>behind in the dark. He shouted and fell; and the hobbit rolled off his shoulders into 
line 1733=>the blackness, bumped his head on hard rock, and remembered nothing more. 
line 1734=> 
line 1735=>
line 1736=>####-<h4>Chapter 5 </h4> <br>
line 1737=>
line 1738=>Riddles in the Dark 
line 1739=>
line 1740=> 
line 1741=>When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered  if he had; for  it was  just as dark as 
line 1742=>with them shut. No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could 
line 1743=>hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the floor.  
line 1744=>Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall of 
line 1745=>the  tunnel;  but  neither  up  nor  down  it  could  he  find  anything:  nothing  at  all,  no 
line 1746=>sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves. His head was swimming, and he was far from 
line 1747=>certain  even  of  the  direction  they  had  been  going  in  when  he  had  his  fall.  He 
line 1748=>guessed  as well  as  he  could,  and  crawled  along  for  a  good way,  till  suddenly  his 
line 1749=>hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel. It 
line 1750=>was  a  turning  point  in  his  career,  but  he  did  not  know  it.  He  put  the  ring  in  his 
line 1751=>pocket  almost without  thinking;  certainly  it  did  not  seem  of  any  particular  use  at 
line 1752=>the moment. He did not go much  further, but sat down on  the cold  floor and gave 
line 1753=>himself  up  to  complete  miserableness,  for  a  long  while.  He  thought  of  himself 
line 1754=>frying bacon and eggs  in his own kitchen at home  - for he could feel inside that it 
line 1755=>was high time for some meal or other; but that only made him miserabler.  
line 1756=>He could not think what to do; nor could he think what had happened; or why 
line 1757=>he  had  been  left  behind;  or  why,  if  he  had  been  left  behind,  the  goblins  had  not 
line 1758=>caught  him;  or  even  why  his  head  was  so  sore.  The  truth  was  he  had  been  lying 
line 1759=>quiet, out of sight and out of mind, in a very dark corner for a long while. 
line 1760=>After some time he felt for his pipe. It was not broken, and that was something. 
line 1761=>Then  he  felt  for  his  pouch,  and  there  was  some  tobacco  in  it,  and  that  was 
line 1762=>something more. Then he felt for matches and he could not find any at all, and that 
line 1763=>shattered his hopes completely. Just as well for him, as he agreed when he came to 
line 1764=>his senses. Goodness knows what the striking of matches and the smell of tobacco 
line 1765=>would  have  brought  on  him  out  of  dark  holes  in  that  horrible  place.  Still  at  the 
line 1766=>moment he felt very crushed. But in slapping all his pockets and feeling all round 
line 1767=>himself  for matches his hand came on  the hilt of his  little sword  - the little dagger 
line 1768=>that he got from the trolls, and that he had quite forgotten; nor do the goblins seem 
line 1769=>to have noticed it, as he wore it inside his breeches. 
line 1770=>Now  he  drew  it  out.  It  shone  pale  and  dim  before  his  eyes.  "So  it  is  an  elvish 
line 1771=>blade, too," he thought; "and goblins are not very near, and yet not far enough." 
line 1772=>But  somehow  he was  comforted.  It was  rather  splendid  to be wearing  a blade 
line 1773=>made  in Gondolin for  the goblin-wars of which so many songs had sung; and also 
line 1774=>
line 1775=>####-he  had  noticed  that  such  weapons made  a  great  impression  on  goblins  that  came 
line 1776=>upon them suddenly.  
line 1777=>"Go  back?"  he  thought.  "No  good  at  all!  Go  sideways?  Impossible!  Go 
line 1778=>forward? Only  thing  to  do! On we  go!"  So  up  he  got,  and  trotted  along with  his 
line 1779=>little sword held in front of him and one hand feeling the wall, and his heart all of 
line 1780=>a patter and a pitter.  
line 1781=> 
line 1782=>Now  certainly  Bilbo  was  in  what  is  called  a  tight  place.  But  you  must 
line 1783=>remember  it  was  not  quite  so  tight  for  him  as  it  would  have  been  for  me  or  for 
line 1784=>you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary people; and after all if their holes are nice 
line 1785=>cheery  places  and  properly  aired,  quite  different  from  the  tunnels  of  the  goblins, 
line 1786=>still they are more used to tunnelling than we are, and they do not easily lose their 
line 1787=>sense  of  direction  underground-not  when  their  heads  have  recovered  from  being 
line 1788=>bumped.  Also  they  can  move  very  quietly,  and  hide  easily,  and  recover 
line 1789=>wonderfully  from  falls  and  bruises,  and  they  have  a  fund  of  wisdom  and  wise 
line 1790=>sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago. 
line 1791=>I  should  not  have  liked  to  have  been  in Mr. Baggins'  place,  all  the  same. The 
line 1792=>tunnel seemed to have no end. All he knew was that it was still going down pretty 
line 1793=>steadily  and  keeping  in  the  same  direction  in  spite  of  a  twist  and  a  turn  or  two. 
line 1794=>There were passages leading off to the side every now and then, as he knew by the 
line 1795=>glimmer of his sword, or  could feel with his hand on the wall. Of these he took no 
line 1796=>notice,  except  to  hurry  past  for  fear  of  goblins  or  half-imagined  dark  things 
line 1797=>coming out of them. On and on he went, and down and down; and still he heard no 
line 1798=>sound of anything except  the occasional  whirr of a bat by his ears, which  startled 
line 1799=>him at first, till it became too frequent to bother about. I do not know how long he 
line 1800=>kept  on  like  this,  hating  to  go  on,  not  daring  to  stop,  on,  on,  until  he was  tireder 
line 1801=>than tired. It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond. 
line 1802=>Suddenly  without  any  warning  he  trotted  splash  into  water!  Ugh!  it  was  icy 
line 1803=>cold. That  pulled  him  up  sharp  and  short. He  did  not  know whether  it was  just  a 
line 1804=>pool in the path, or the edge of an underground stream that crossed the passage, or 
line 1805=>the  brink  of  a  deep  dark  subterranean  lake.  The  sword was  hardly  shining  at  all. 
line 1806=>He  stopped,  and  he  could  hear,  when  he  listened  hard,  drops  drip-drip-dripping 
line 1807=>from an unseen roof into the water below; but there seemed no other sort of sound. 
line 1808=>"So  it  is  a  pool  or  a  lake,  and  not  an  underground  river,"  he  thought.  Still  he 
line 1809=>did  not  dare  to  wade  out  into  the  darkness.  He  could  not  swim;  and  he  thought, 
line 1810=>too,  of  nasty  slimy  things,  with  big  bulging  blind  eyes,  wriggling  in  the  water. 
line 1811=>There  are  strange  things  living  in  the  pools  and  lakes  in  the  hearts  of mountains: 
line 1812=>
line 1813=>####-fish whose fathers swam in, goodness only knows how many years ago, and never 
line 1814=>swam out again, while their eyes grew bigger and bigger and bigger from trying to 
line 1815=>see  in  the  blackness;  also  there  are other  things more  slimy  than  fish. Even  in  the 
line 1816=>tunnels  and  caves  the  goblins  have  made  for  themselves  there  are  other  things 
line 1817=>living unbeknown to them that have sneaked in from outside to lie up in the dark. 
line 1818=>Some  of  these  caves,  too,  go  back  in  their  beginnings  to  ages  before  the  goblins, 
line 1819=>who  only  widened  them  and  joined  them  up  with  passages,  and  the  original 
line 1820=>owners are still there in odd comers, slinking and nosing about. 
line 1821=>Deep down here by  the dark water  lived old Gollum, a small slimy creature. I 
line 1822=>don't  know where  he  came  from,  nor who  or what  he was. He was Gollum  — as 
line 1823=>dark  as  darkness,  except  for  two  big  round  pale  eyes  in  his  thin  face.  He  had  a 
line 1824=>little boat, and he rowed about quite quietly on the lake; for lake it was, wide and 
line 1825=>deep  and  deadly  cold.  He  paddled  it  with  large  feet  dangling  over  the  side,  but 
line 1826=>never a ripple did he make. Not he. He was looking out of his pale lamp-like eyes 
line 1827=>for  blind  fish,  which  he  grabbed  with  his  long  fingers  as  quick  as  thinking.  He 
line 1828=>liked  meat  too.  Goblin  he  thought  good,  when  he  could  get  it;  but  he  took  care 
line 1829=>they  never  found  him  out.  He  just  throttled  them  from  behind,  if  they  ever  came 
line 1830=>down  alone  anywhere  near  the  edge  of  the  water,  while  he  was  prowling  about. 
line 1831=>They  very  seldom  did,  for  they  had  a  feeling  that  something  unpleasant  was 
line 1832=>lurking down there, down at the very roots of the mountain. They had come on the 
line 1833=>lake, when  they were  tunnelling down  long ago, and  they  found  they could go no 
line 1834=>further;  so  there  their  road  ended  in  that  direction,  and  there was no  reason  to go 
line 1835=>that  way-unless  the  Great  Goblin  sent  them.  Sometimes  he  took  a  fancy  for  fish 
line 1836=>from the lake, and sometimes neither goblin nor fish came back. 
line 1837=>Actually Gollum  lived on a slimy  island of  rock  in  the middle of  the  lake. He 
line 1838=>was  watching  Bilbo  now  from  the  distance  with  his  pale  eyes  like  telescopes. 
line 1839=>Bilbo could not see him, but he was wondering a lot about Bilbo, for he could see 
line 1840=>that he was no goblin at all. 
line 1841=>Gollum got  into his boat  and  shot off  from  the  island, while Bilbo was  sitting 
line 1842=>on  the  brink  altogether  flummoxed  and  at  the  end  of  his  way  and  his  wits. 
line 1843=>Suddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed: 
line 1844=>"Bless  us  and  splash  us, my  precioussss!  I  guess  it's  a  choice  feast;  at  least  a 
line 1845=>tasty morsel  it'd make  us,  gollum!" And when  he  said gollum he made a horrible 
line 1846=>swallowing  noise  in  his  throat.  That  is  how  he  got  his  name,  though  he  always 
line 1847=>called himself 'my precious.' 
line 1848=>The  hobbit  jumped  nearly  out  of  his  skin when  the  hiss  came  in  his  ears,  and 
line 1849=>he suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him. 
line 1850=>
line 1851=>####-"Who are you?" he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him. 
line 1852=>"What iss he, my preciouss?" whispered Gollum (who always spoke to himself 
line 1853=>through  never  having  anyone  else  to  speak  to). This  is what  he  had  come  to  find 
line 1854=>out,  for  he was  not  really  very  hungry  at  the moment, only  curious; otherwise he 
line 1855=>would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards. 
line 1856=>"I  am Mr. Bilbo Baggins.  I  have  lost  the  dwarves  and  I  have  lost  the wizard, 
line 1857=>and I don't know where I am; and "I don't want to know, if only I can get ,away." 
line 1858=>"What's  he  got  in  his  handses?"  said Gollum,  looking  at  the  sword, which  he 
line 1859=>did not quite like. 
line 1860=>"A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!" 
line 1861=>"Sssss,"  said  Gollum,  and  became  quite  polite.  "Praps  ye  sits  here  and  chats 
line 1862=>with  it  a  bitsy,  my  preciousss.  It  like  riddles,  praps  it  does,  does  it?"  He  was 
line 1863=>anxious  to  appear  friendly,  at  any  rate  for  the  moment,  and  until  he  found  out 
line 1864=>more  about  the  sword  and  the  hobbit, whether  he was  quite  alone  really, whether 
line 1865=>he  was  good  to  eat,  and  whether  Gollum  was  really  hungry.  Riddles were  all  he 
line 1866=>could  think  of.  Asking  them,  and  sometimes  guessing  them,  had  been  the  only 
line 1867=>game  he  had  ever  played  with  other  funny  creatures  sitting  in  their  holes  in  the 
line 1868=>long, long ago, before he lost all his friends and was driven away, alone, and crept 
line 1869=>down, down, into the dark under the mountains. 
line 1870=>"Very  well,"  said  Bilbo,  who  was  anxious  to  agree,  until  he  found  out  more 
line 1871=>about  the  creature, whether  he was  quite  alone, whether  he was  fierce  or  hungry, 
line 1872=>and whether he was a friend of the goblins. 
line 1873=>"You ask first," he said, because he had not had time to think of a riddle. 
line 1874=>So Gollum hissed: 
line 1875=> 
line 1876=>
line 1877=>What has roots as nobody sees, 
line 1878=>Is taller than trees, 
line 1879=>Up, up it goes, 
line 1880=>And yet never grows?  
line 1881=>
line 1882=> 
line 1883=>"Easy!" said Bilbo. "Mountain, I suppose." 
line 1884=>"Does  it  guess  easy?  It  must  have  a  competition  with  us,  my  preciouss!  If 
line 1885=>precious asks, and it doesn't answer, we eats it, my preciousss. If it asks us, and we 
line 1886=>doesn't answer, then we does what it wants, eh? We shows it the way out, yes!" 
line 1887=>"All  right!" said Bilbo, not daring  to disagree, and nearly bursting his brain to 
line 1888=>think of riddles that could save him from being eaten. 
line 1889=> 
line 1890=>
line 1891=>Thirty white horses on a red hill, 
line 1892=>
line 1893=>####-First they champ, 
line 1894=>Then they stamp, 
line 1895=>Then they stand still. 
line 1896=>
line 1897=> 
line 1898=>That was all he could think of to ask-the idea of eating was rather on his mind. 
line 1899=>It was rather an old one, too, and Gollum knew the answer as well as you do. 
line 1900=>"Chestnuts,  chestnuts,"  he  hissed.  "Teeth!  teeth!  my  preciousss;  but  we  has 
line 1901=>only six!" Then he asked his second: 
line 1902=> 
line 1903=>
line 1904=>Voiceless it cries, 
line 1905=>Wingless flutters, 
line 1906=>Toothless bites, 
line 1907=>Mouthless mutters. 
line 1908=>
line 1909=> 
line 1910=>"Half  a  moment!"  cried  Bilbo,  who  was  still  thinking  uncomfortably  about 
line 1911=>eating.  Fortunately  he  had  once  heard  something  rather  like  this  before,  and 
line 1912=>getting  his  wits  back  he  thought  of  the  answer.  "Wind,  wind  of  course,"  he  said, 
line 1913=>and  he was  so  pleased  that  he made  up  one  on  the  spot.  "This'll  puzzle  the  nasty 
line 1914=>little underground creature," he thought: 
line 1915=> 
line 1916=>
line 1917=>An eye in a blue face 
line 1918=>Saw an eye in a green face. 
line 1919=>"That eye is like to this eye"  
line 1920=>Said the first eye, 
line 1921=>"But in low place, 
line 1922=>Not in  high place."  
line 1923=>
line 1924=> 
line 1925=>"Ss, ss, ss," said Gollum. He had been underground a long long time, and was 
line 1926=>forgetting  this  sort  of  thing.  But  just  as  Bilbo  was  beginning  to  hope  that  the 
line 1927=>wretch  would  not  be  able  to  answer,  Gollum  brought  up  memories  of  ages  and 
line 1928=>ages and ages before, when he lived with his grandmother in a hole in a bank by a 
line 1929=>river, "Sss, sss, my preciouss," he said. "Sun on the daisies it means, it does." 
line 1930=>But  these  ordinary  aboveground  everyday  sort  of  riddles  were  tiring  for  him. 
line 1931=>Also  they  reminded  him  of  days  when  he  had  been  less  lonely  and  sneaky  and 
line 1932=>nasty, and that put him out of temper. What is more they made him hungry; so this 
line 1933=>time he tried something a bit more difficult and more unpleasant: 
line 1934=> 
line 1935=>
line 1936=>It cannot be seen, cannot be felt, 
line 1937=>Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt. 
line 1938=>
line 1939=>####-It lies behind stars and under hills, 
line 1940=>And empty holes it fills. 
line 1941=>It comes first and follows after,  
line 1942=>Ends life, kills laughter.  
line 1943=>
line 1944=> 
line 1945=>Unfortunately  for  Gollum  Bilbo  had  heard  that  sort  of  thing  before;  and  the 
line 1946=>answer  was  all  round  him  anyway.  "Dark!"  he  said  without  even  scratching  his 
line 1947=>head or putting on his thinking cap. 
line 1948=> 
line 1949=>
line 1950=>A box without hinges, key, or lid, 
line 1951=>Yet golden treasure inside is hid, 
line 1952=>
line 1953=> 
line 1954=>he asked  to gain  time, until he could  think of a really hard one. This he  thought a 
line 1955=>dreadfully  easy  chestnut,  though  he  had  not  asked  it  in  the  usual  words.  But  it 
line 1956=>proved a nasty poser for Gollum. He hissed to himself, and still he did not answer; 
line 1957=>he whispered and spluttered. 
line 1958=>After  some  while  Bilbo  became  impatient.  "Well,  what  is  it?"  he  said.  "The 
line 1959=>answer's  not  a  kettle  boiling  over,  as  you  seem  to  think  from  the  noise  you  are 
line 1960=>making." 
line 1961=>"Give us a chance; let it give us a chance, my preciouss-ss-ss." 
line 1962=>"Well," said Bilbo, after giving him a long chance, "what about your guess?" 
line 1963=>But  suddenly  Gollum  remembered  thieving  from  nests  long  ago,  and  sitting 
line 1964=>under  the  river bank  teaching his grandmother,  teaching his grandmother  to suck-
line 1965=>"Eggses!" he hissed. "Eggses it is!" Then he asked: 
line 1966=> 
line 1967=>
line 1968=>A live without breath, 
line 1969=>As cold as death; 
line 1970=>Never thirsty, ever drinking, 
line 1971=>All in mail never clinking. 
line 1972=>
line 1973=> 
line 1974=>He  also  in  his  turn  thought  this  was  a  dreadfully  easy  one,  because  he  was 
line 1975=>always  thinking  of  the  answer. But  he  could  not  remember  anything  better  at  the 
line 1976=>moment,  he was  so  flustered  by  the  egg-question. All  the  same  it was  a poser  for 
line 1977=>poor  Bilbo,  who  never  had  anything  to  do  with  the  water  if  he  could  help  it.  I 
line 1978=>imagine you know the answer, of course, or can guess it as easy as winking, since 
line 1979=>you  are  sitting  comfortably  at  home  and  have  not  the  danger  of  being  eaten  to 
line 1980=>disturb  your  thinking.  Bilbo  sat  and  cleared  his  throat  once  or  twice,  but  no 
line 1981=>answer came. 
line 1982=>
line 1983=>####-After  a  while  Gollum  began  to  hiss  with  pleasure  to  himself:  "Is  it  nice,  my 
line 1984=>preciousss? Is it juicy? Is it scrumptiously crunchable?" He began to peer at Bilbo 
line 1985=>out of the darkness. 
line 1986=>"Half  a  moment,"  said  the  hobbit  shivering.  "I  gave  you  a  good  long  chance 
line 1987=>just now." 
line 1988=>"It must make  haste,  haste!"  said Gollum,  beginning  to  climb  out  of  his  boat 
line 1989=>on to the shore to get at Bilbo. But when he put his long webby foot in the water, a 
line 1990=>fish jumped out in a fright and fell on Bilbo's toes. 
line 1991=>"Ugh!"  he  said,  "it  is  cold  and  clammy!"-and  so  he  guessed.  "Fish!  Fish!"  he 
line 1992=>cried. "It is fish!" 
line 1993=>Gollum was  dreadfully  disappointed;  but Bilbo  asked  another  riddle  as  quick 
line 1994=>as ever be could, so that Gollum had to get back into his boat and think. 
line 1995=> 
line 1996=>No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some. 
line 1997=> 
line 1998=>It was not really the right time for this riddle, but Bilbo was in a hurry. Gollum 
line 1999=>might  have  had  some  trouble  guessing  it,  if  he  had  asked  it  at  another time. As it 
line 2000=>was,  talking  of  fish,  "no-legs" was not so very difficult, and after that the rest was 
line 2001=>easy. "Fish on a  little  table, man at  table sitting on a stool,  the cat has  the bones"-
line 2002=>that  of  course  is  the  answer,  and  Gollum  soon  gave  it.  Then  he  thought  the  time 
line 2003=>had come to ask something hard and horrible. This is what he said: 
line 2004=> 
line 2005=>
line 2006=>This thing all things devours:  
line 2007=>Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;  
line 2008=>Gnaws iron, bites steel; 
line 2009=>Grinds hard stones to meal; 
line 2010=>Slays king, ruins town, 
line 2011=>And beats high mountain down. 
line 2012=>
line 2013=> 
line 2014=>Poor  Bilbo  sat  in  the  dark  thinking  of  all  the  horrible  names  of  all  the  giants 
line 2015=>and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales, but not one of them had done all these 
line 2016=>things.  He  had  a  feeling  that  the  answer  was  quite  different  and  that  he  ought  to 
line 2017=>know it, but he could not think of it. He began to get frightened, and that is bad for 
line 2018=>thinking.  Gollum  began  to  get  out  of  his  boat.  He  flapped  into  the  water  and 
line 2019=>paddled  to  the  bank;  Bilbo  could  see  his  eyes  coming  towards  him.  His  tongue 
line 2020=>seemed  to  stick  in  his mouth; he wanted  to  shout out:  "Give me more  time! Give 
line 2021=>me time!" But all that came out with a sudden squeal was: 
line 2022=>"Time! Time!" 
line 2023=>
line 2024=>####-Bilbo was saved by pure luck. For that of course was the answer.  
line 2025=>Gollum was  disappointed  once more;  and  now  he was  getting  angry,  and also 
line 2026=>tired  of  the  game.  It  had made  him  very  hungry  indeed.  This  time  he  did  not  go 
line 2027=>back  to  the  boat.  He  sat  down  in  the  dark  by  Bilbo.  That  made  the  hobbit  most 
line 2028=>dreadfully uncomfortable and scattered his wits. 
line 2029=>"It's  got  to  ask  uss  a  quesstion, my  preciouss, yes, yess, yesss.  Jusst one more 
line 2030=>quesstion to guess, yes, yess," said Gollum. 
line 2031=>But  Bilbo  simply  could  not  think  of  any  question  with  that  nasty  wet  cold 
line 2032=>thing  sitting  next  to  him,  and  pawing  and  poking  him.  He  scratched  himself,  he 
line 2033=>pinched himself; still he could not think of anything. 
line 2034=>"Ask us! ask us!" said Gollum. 
line 2035=>Bilbo  pinched  himself  and  slapped  himself;  he  gripped  on  his  little  sword;  he 
line 2036=>even felt  in his pocket with his other hand. There he found  the ring he had picked 
line 2037=>up in the passage and forgotten about. 
line 2038=>"What have I got in my pocket?" he said aloud. He was talking to himself, but 
line 2039=>Gollum thought it was a riddle, and he was frightfully upset. 
line 2040=>"Not fair! not fair!" he hissed. "It isn't fair, my precious, is it, to ask us what it's 
line 2041=>got in its nassty little pocketses?" 
line 2042=>Bilbo seeing what had happened and having nothing better  to ask stuck  to his 
line 2043=>question. "What have I got in my pocket?" he said louder.  
line 2044=>"S-s-s-s-s,"  hissed  Gollum.  "It  must  give  us  three  guesseses,  my  preciouss, 
line 2045=>three guesseses." 
line 2046=>"Very well! Guess away!" said Bilbo. 
line 2047=>"Handses!" said Gollum. 
line 2048=>"Wrong," said Bilbo, who had luckily just taken his hand 
line 2049=>out again. "Guess again!" 
line 2050=>"S-s-s-s-s,"  said Gollum more  upset  than  ever. He  thought  of  all  the  things  he 
line 2051=>kept  in  his  own  pockets:  fishbones,  goblins'  teeth, wet  shells,  a  bit  of  bat-wing, a 
line 2052=>sharp stone to sharpen his fangs on, and other nasty things. He tried to think what 
line 2053=>other people kept in their pockets. 
line 2054=>"Knife!" he said at last. 
line 2055=>"Wrong!" said Bilbo, who had lost his some time ago. "Last guess!" 
line 2056=>Now Gollum was  in  a much worse  state  than when  Bilbo  had  asked  him  the 
line 2057=>egg-question.  He  hissed  and  spluttered  and  rocked  himself  backwards  and 
line 2058=>forwards, and slapped his feet on the floor, and wriggled and squirmed; but still he 
line 2059=>did not dare to waste his last guess. 
line 2060=>
line 2061=>####-"Come  on!"  said  Bilbo.  "I  am waiting!" He  tried  to  sound  bold  and  cheerful, 
line 2062=>but  he  did  not  feel  at  all  sure  how  the  game  was  going  to  end,  whether  Gollum 
line 2063=>guessed right or not. 
line 2064=>"Time's up!" he said. 
line 2065=>"String,  or  nothing!"  shrieked  Gollum,  which  was  not  quite  fair-working  in 
line 2066=>two guesses at once. 
line 2067=>"Both  wrong,"  cried  Bilbo  very much  relieved;  and  he  jumped  at  once  to  his 
line 2068=>feet,  put  his  back  to  the  nearest  wall,  and  held  out  his  little  sword.  He  knew,  of 
line 2069=>course,  that  the  riddle-game  was  sacred  and  of  immense  antiquity,  and  even 
line 2070=>wicked creatures were afraid  to cheat when  they played at  it. But he  felt he could 
line 2071=>not trust this slimy thing to keep any promise at a pinch. Any excuse would do for 
line 2072=>him to slide out of it. And after all that last question had not been a genuine riddle 
line 2073=>according to the ancient laws. 
line 2074=>But at any  rate Gollum did not at once attack him. He could  see  the  sword  in 
line 2075=>Bilbo's  hand.  He  sat  still,  shivering  and  whispering.  At  last  Bilbo  could  wait  no 
line 2076=>longer.  
line 2077=>"Well?" he said. "What about your  promise? I want to go. You must show me 
line 2078=>the way." 
line 2079=>"Did we say so, precious? Show the nassty little Baggins the way out, yes, yes. 
line 2080=>But what has  it got  in  its pocketses, eh? Not string, precious, but not nothing. Oh 
line 2081=>no! gollum!" 
line 2082=>"Never you mind," said Bilbo. "A promise is a promise." 
line 2083=>"Cross  it  is,  impatient,  precious,"  hissed  Gollum.  "But  it  must  wait,  yes  it 
line 2084=>must. We  can't  go  up  the  tunnels  so  hasty. We must  go  and  get  some  things  first, 
line 2085=>yes, things to help us." 
line 2086=>"Well,  hurry  up!"  said  Bilbo,  relieved  to  think  of  Gollum  going  away.  He 
line 2087=>thought he was just making an excuse and did not mean to come back. What was 
line 2088=>Gollum talking about? What useful thing could he keep out on the dark lake? But 
line 2089=>he  was  wrong.  Gollum  did  mean  to  come  back.  He  was  angry  now  and  hungry.  
line 2090=>And he was a miserable wicked creature, and already he had a plan. 
line 2091=>Not  far  away  was  his  island,  of  which  Bilbo  knew  nothing,  and  there  in  his 
line 2092=>hiding-place he kept a few wretched oddments, and one very beautiful thing, very 
line 2093=>beautiful, very wonderful. He had a ring, a golden ring, a precious ring. 
line 2094=>"My  birthday-present!"  he  whispered  to  himself,  as  he  had  often  done  in  the 
line 2095=>endless dark days. "That's what we wants now, yes; we wants it!" 
line 2096=>
line 2097=>####-He  wanted  it  because  it  was  a  ring  of  power,  and  if  you  slipped  that  ring on 
line 2098=>your  finger,  you  were  invisible;  only  in  the  full  sunlight  could  you  be  seen,  and 
line 2099=>then only by your shadow, and that would be shaky and faint. 
line 2100=>"My  birthday-present! It came to me on my birthday, my precious," So he had 
line 2101=>always  said  to  himself.  But  who  knows  how Gollum  came  by  that  present,  ages 
line 2102=>ago  in  the old days when such rings were still at  large  in  the world? Perhaps even 
line 2103=>the Master who ruled them could not have said. Gollum used to wear it at first, till 
line 2104=>it tired him; and then he kept it in a pouch next his skin, till it galled him; and now 
line 2105=>usually he hid it in a hole in the rock on his island, and was always going back to 
line 2106=>look  at  it.  And  still  sometimes  he  put  it  on,  when  he  could  not  bear  to  be  parted 
line 2107=>from  it  any  longer,  or when  he was  very,  very,  hungry, and  tired of  fish. Then he 
line 2108=>would creep along dark passages looking for stray goblins. He might even venture 
line 2109=>into  places  where  the  torches  were  lit  and made  his  eyes  blink  and  smart;  for  he 
line 2110=>would  be  safe.  Oh  yes,  quite  safe.  No  one  would  see  him,  no  one  would  notice 
line 2111=>him,  till  he  had  his  fingers  on  their  throat. Only  a  few  hours  ago  he  had worn  it, 
line 2112=>and caught a small goblin-imp. How it squeaked! He still had a bone or two left to 
line 2113=>gnaw, but he wanted something softer.  
line 2114=>"Quite  safe,  yes,"  he  whispered  to  himself.  "It  won't  see  us,  will  it,  my 
line 2115=>precious? No. It won't see us, and its nassty little sword will be useless, yes quite." 
line 2116=>That is what was in his wicked little mind, as he slipped suddenly from Bilbo's 
line 2117=>side,  and  flapped  back  to  his  boat,  and  went  off  into  the  dark.  Bilbo  thought  he 
line 2118=>had  heard  the  last  of  him. Still  he waited  a while;  for  he  had  no  idea  how  to  find 
line 2119=>his way out alone. 
line 2120=>Suddenly  he  heard  a  screech.  It  sent  a  shiver  down  his  back.  Gollum  was 
line 2121=>cursing and wailing away in the gloom, not very far off by the sound of it. He was 
line 2122=>on his island, scrabbling here and there, searching and seeking in vain. 
line 2123=>"Where is it? Where iss it?" Bilbo heard him crying. "Losst it is, my precious, 
line 2124=>lost, lost! Curse us and crush us, my precious is lost!" 
line 2125=>"What's the matter?" Bilbo called. "What have you lost?" 
line 2126=>"It mustn't  ask  us,"  shrieked Gollum.  "Not  its  business,  no,  gollum!  It's  losst, 
line 2127=>gollum, gollum, gollum." 
line 2128=>"Well,  so  am  I,"  cried  Bilbo,  "and  I want  to  get  unlost. And  I won  the  game, 
line 2129=>and you promised. So come along! Come and let me out, and then go on with your 
line 2130=>looking!" 
line 2131=>Utterly  miserable  as  Gollum  sounded,  Bilbo  could  not  find  much  pity  in  his 
line 2132=>heart, and he had a feeling that anything Gollum wanted so much could hardly be 
line 2133=>something good. 
line 2134=>
line 2135=>####-"Come along!" he shouted. 
line 2136=>"No,  not  yet,  precious!"  Gollum  answered.  "We  must  search  for  it,  it's  lost, 
line 2137=>gollum." 
line 2138=>"But you never guessed my last question, and you promised," said Bilbo. 
line 2139=>"Never guessed!"  said Gollum. Then  suddenly out of  the gloom came a  sharp 
line 2140=>hiss. "What has it got in its pocketses? Tell us that. It must tell first." 
line 2141=>As  far  as  Bilbo  knew,  there  was  no  particular  reason  why  he  should  not  tell. 
line 2142=>Gollum's mind had jumped to a guess quicker than his; naturally, for Gollum had 
line 2143=>brooded  for  ages  on  this  one  thing,  and  he  was  always  afraid  of  its  being  stolen. 
line 2144=>But Bilbo was annoyed at  the delay. After all, he had won  the game, pretty fairly, 
line 2145=>at a horrible risk. "Answers were to be guessed not given," he said. 
line 2146=>"But it wasn't a fair question," said Gollum. "Not a riddle, precious, no." 
line 2147=>"Oh  well,  if  it's  a  matter  of  ordinary  questions,"  Bilbo  replied,  "then  I  asked 
line 2148=>one first. What have you lost? Tell me that!" 
line 2149=>"What has it got in its pocketses?" The sound came hissing louder and sharper, 
line 2150=>and as he  looked  towards  it,  to his alarm  Bilbo now saw two small points of light 
line 2151=>peering  at  him. As  suspicion  grew  in Gollum's mind,  the  light  of  his  eyes  burned 
line 2152=>with a pale flame. 
line 2153=>"What have you lost?" Bilbo persisted. But now the light in Gollum's eyes had 
line 2154=>become  a  green  fire,  and  it  was  coming  swiftly  nearer.  Gollum  was  in  his  boat 
line 2155=>again,  paddling  wildly  back  to  the  dark  shore;  and  such  a  rage  of  loss  and 
line 2156=>suspicion was in his heart that no sword had any more terror for him. 
line 2157=>Bilbo  could  not  guess  what  had maddened  the  wretched  creature,  but  he  saw 
line 2158=>that all was up, and that Gollum meant to murder him at any rate. Just in time he 
line 2159=>turned  and  ran  blindly  back  up  the  dark  passage  down  which  he  had  come, 
line 2160=>keeping close to the wall and feeling it with his left hand. 
line 2161=>"What  has  it  got  in  its  pocketses?"  he heard  the hiss  loud behind him, and  the 
line 2162=>splash as Gollum leapt from his boat. 
line 2163=>"What have I, I wonder?" he said to himself, as he panted and stumbled along. 
line 2164=>He put his left hand in his pocket. The ring felt very cold as it quietly slipped on to 
line 2165=>his groping forefinger.  
line 2166=>The  hiss  was  close  behind  him.  He  turned  now  and  saw  Gollum's  eyes  like 
line 2167=>small  green  lamps  coming  up  the  slope.  Terrified  he  tried  to  run  faster,  but 
line 2168=>suddenly he struck his toes on a snag in the floor, and fell flat with his little sword 
line 2169=>under him. 
line 2170=>
line 2171=>####-In a moment Gollum was on him. But before Bilbo could do anything, recover 
line 2172=>his breath, pick himself up, or wave his sword, Gollum passed by, taking no notice 
line 2173=>of him, cursing and whispering as he ran. 
line 2174=>What could it mean? Gollum could see in the dark. Bilbo could see the light of 
line 2175=>his  eyes  palely  shining  even  from  behind.  Painfully  he  got  up,  and  sheathed  his 
line 2176=>sword,  which  was  now  glowing  faintly  again,  then  very  cautiously  he  followed. 
line 2177=>There seemed nothing else to do. It was no good crawling back down to Gollum's 
line 2178=>water. Perhaps if he followed him, Gollum might lead him to some way of escape 
line 2179=>without meaning to. 
line 2180=>"Curse  it!  curse  it!  curse  it!"  hissed  Gollum.  "Curse  the  Baggins!  It's  gone! 
line 2181=>What has it got in its pocketses? Oh we guess, we guess, my precious. He's found 
line 2182=>it, yes he must have. My birthday-present." 
line 2183=>Bilbo  pricked  up  his  ears.  He  was  at  last  beginning  to  guess  himself.  He 
line 2184=>hurried  a  little,  getting  as  close  as  he  dared  behind  Gollum,  who  was  still  going 
line 2185=>quickly,  not  looking  back,  but  turning  his  head  from  side  to  side,  as Bilbo  could 
line 2186=>see from the faint glimmer on the walls. 
line 2187=>"My birthday-present! Curse it! How did we lose it, my precious? Yes, that's it. 
line 2188=>When we came  this way  last, when we  twisted  that nassty young squeaker. That's 
line 2189=>it. Curse it! It slipped from us, after all these ages and ages! It's gone, gollum." 
line 2190=>Suddenly Gollum sat down and began to weep, a whistling and gurgling sound 
line 2191=>horrible  to  listen  to.  Bilbo  halted  and  flattened  himself  against  the  tunnel-wall. 
line 2192=>After a while Gollum stopped weeping and began to talk. He seemed to be having 
line 2193=>an argument with himself. 
line 2194=>"It's  no  good  going  back  there  to  search,  no.  We  doesn't  remember  all  the 
line 2195=>places we've  visited. And  it's  no  use.  The  Baggins  has  got  it  in  its  pocketses;  the 
line 2196=>nassty noser has found it, we says." 
line 2197=>"We  guesses,  precious,  only  guesses.  We  can't  know  till  we  find  the  nassty 
line 2198=>creature and squeezes it. But it doesn't know what the present can do, does it? It'll 
line 2199=>just  keep  it  in  its  pocketses.  It  doesn't  know,  and  it  can't  go  far.  It's  lost  itself, the 
line 2200=>nassty nosey thing. It doesn't know the way out It said so." 
line 2201=>"It  said  so, yes; but  it's  tricksy.  It doesn't  say what  it means.  It won't  say what 
line 2202=>it's got in its pocketses. It knows. It knows a way in, it must know a way out, yes. 
line 2203=>It's off to the back-door. To the back-door, that's it." 
line 2204=>"The goblinses will catch it then. It can't get out that way, precious." 
line 2205=>"Ssss,  sss,  gollum!  Goblinses!  Yes,  but  if  it's  got  the  present,  our  precious 
line 2206=>present,  then  goblinses  will  get  it,  gollum!  They'll  find  it,  they'll  find  out what  it 
line 2207=>does. We shan't ever be safe again, never, gollum! One of  the goblinses will put  it 
line 2208=>
line 2209=>####-on, and  then no one will  see him. He'll be  there but not  seen. Not even our clever 
line 2210=>eyeses  will  notice  him;  and  he'll  come  creepsy  and  tricksy  and  catch  us,  gollum, 
line 2211=>gollum!" 
line 2212=>"Then let's stop talking, precious, and make haste. If the Baggins has gone that 
line 2213=>way, we must go quick and see. Go! Not far now. Make haste!" 
line 2214=>With  a  spring Gollum got up  and  started  shambling off  at  a great pace. Bilbo 
line 2215=>hurried  after  him,  still  cautiously,  though  his  chief  fear  now  was  of  tripping  on 
line 2216=>another snag and falling with a noise. His head was in a whirl of hope and wonder. 
line 2217=>It  seemed  that  the  ring  he  had  was  a  magic  ring:  it  made  you  invisible!  He  had 
line 2218=>heard  of  such  things,  of  course,  in old old  tales; but  it was hard  to believe  that he 
line 2219=>really  had  found  one,  by  accident.  Still  there  it was: Gollum with  his  bright  eyes 
line 2220=>had passed him by, only a yard to one side. 
line 2221=>On  they  went,  Gollum  flip-flapping  ahead,  hissing  and  cursing;  Bilbo  behind 
line 2222=>going  as  softly  as  a  hobbit  can.  Soon  they  came  to  places  where,  as  Bilbo  had 
line 2223=>noticed  on  the way  down,  side-passages opened, this way and that. Gollum began 
line 2224=>at once to count them. 
line 2225=>"One  left,  yes. One  right,  yes. Two  right,  yes,  yes. Two  left,  yes,  yes." And so 
line 2226=>on and on. 
line 2227=>As  the count grew he slowed down, and he began  to get shaky and weepy; for 
line 2228=>he  was  leaving  the  water  further  and  further  behind,  and  he  was  getting  afraid. 
line 2229=>Goblins  might  be  about,  and  he  had  lost  his  ring.  At  last  he  stopped  by  a  low 
line 2230=>opening, on their left as they went up. 
line 2231=>"Seven  right,  yes.  Six  left,  yes!"  he  whispered.  "This  is  it.  This  is  the  way  to 
line 2232=>the back-door, yes. Here's the passage!" 
line 2233=>He  peered  in,  and  shrank  back.  "But  we  durstn't  go  in,  precious,  no  we 
line 2234=>durstn't. Goblinses down there. Lots of goblinses. We smells them. Ssss!" 
line 2235=>"What shall we do? Curse them and crush them! We must wait here, precious, 
line 2236=>wait a bit and see." 
line 2237=>So  they  came  to  a  dead  stop. Gollum  had  brought  Bilbo  to  the way  out  after 
line 2238=>all,  but  Bilbo  could  not  get  in!  There was Gollum  sitting humped up  right  in  the 
line 2239=>opening,  and his  eyes gleamed  cold  in his head,  as he  swayed  it  from  side  to  side 
line 2240=>between his knees. 
line 2241=>Bilbo  crept  away  from  the  wall  more  quietly  than  a  mouse;  but  Gollum 
line 2242=>stiffened  at  once,  and  sniffed,  and  his  eyes  went  green.  He  hissed  softly  but 
line 2243=>menacingly. He could not see  the hobbit, but now he was on  the alert, and he had 
line 2244=>other senses  that  the darkness had sharpened: hearing and smell. He seemed  to be 
line 2245=>crouched  right  down with  his  flat  hands  splayed  on  the  floor, and his head  thrust 
line 2246=>
line 2247=>####-out, nose almost to the stone. Though he was only a black shadow in the gleam of 
line 2248=>his own eyes, Bilbo could see or feel that he was tense as a bowstring, gathered for 
line 2249=>a spring. 
line 2250=>Bilbo  almost  stopped  breathing,  and  went  stiff  himself. He was desperate. He 
line 2251=>must  get  away,  out  of  this  horrible  darkness,  while  he  had  any  strength  left.  He 
line 2252=>must  fight.  He  must  stab  the  foul  thing,  put  its  eyes  out,  kill  it.  It  meant  to  kill 
line 2253=>him.  No,  not  a  fair  fight.  He  was  invisible  now.  Gollum  had  no  sword. Gollum 
line 2254=>had  not  actually  threatened  to  kill  him,  or  tried  to  yet.  And  he  was  miserable, 
line 2255=>alone, lost. A sudden understanding, a pity mixed with horror, welled up in Bilbo's 
line 2256=>heart:  a  glimpse  of  endless  unmarked  days  without  light  or  hope  of  betterment, 
line 2257=>hard stone, cold fish, sneaking and whispering. All these thoughts passed in a flash 
line 2258=>of a second. He  trembled. And  then quite suddenly  in another flash, as  if  lifted by 
line 2259=>a new strength and resolve, he leaped. 
line 2260=>No great leap for a man, but a leap in the dark. Straight over Gollum's head he 
line 2261=>jumped,  seven  feet  forward  and  three  in  the  air;  indeed, had he known  it, he only 
line 2262=>just missed cracking his skull on the low arch of the passage. 
line 2263=>Gollum  threw  himself  backwards,  and  grabbed  as  the  hobbit  flew  over  him, 
line 2264=>but  too  late:  his  hands  snapped  on  thin  air,  and  Bilbo,  falling  fair  on  his  sturdy 
line 2265=>feet, sped off down the new tunnel. He did not turn to see what Gollum was doing. 
line 2266=>There was a hissing and cursing almost at his heels at  first,  then  it stopped. All at 
line 2267=>once  there  came  a  bloodcurdling  shriek,  filled  with  hatred  and  despair.  Gollum 
line 2268=>was defeated. He dared go no  further. He had  lost:  lost his prey, and  lost,  too,  the 
line 2269=>only thing he had ever cared for, his precious. The cry brought Bilbo's heart to his 
line 2270=>mouth,  but  still  he  held  on. Now  faint  as  an  echo,  but menacing,  the  voice  came 
line 2271=>behind: 
line 2272=>"Thief, thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it for ever!" 
line 2273=>Then  there was  a  silence. But  that  too  seemed menacing  to Bilbo.  "If  goblins 
line 2274=>are  so  near  that  he  smelt  them," he  thought, "then  they'll have heard his shrieking 
line 2275=>and cursing. Careful now, or this way will lead you to worse things." 
line 2276=>The passage was low and roughly made. It was not too difficult for the hobbit, 
line 2277=>except when,  in  spite of all care, he  stubbed his poor  toes again, several times, on 
line 2278=>nasty  jagged  stones  in  the  floor.  "A  bit  low  for  goblins,  at  least  for  the  big  ones," 
line 2279=>thought Bilbo,  not  knowing  that  even  the  big  ones,  the  ores  of  the mountains,  go 
line 2280=>along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground. 
line 2281=>Soon the passage that had been sloping down began to go up again, and after a 
line 2282=>while  it  climbed  steeply.  That  slowed  Bilbo  down.  But  at  last  the  slope  stopped, 
line 2283=>the passage  turned a corner, and dipped down again, and  there, at  the bottom of a 
line 2284=>
line 2285=>####-short  incline,  he  saw,  filtering  round  another  corner-a  glimpse  of  light.  Not  red 
line 2286=>light,  as  of  fire  or  lantern,  but  a  pale  out-of-doors  sort of  light. Then Bilbo began 
line 2287=>to run. 
line 2288=>Scuttling as fast as his legs would carry him he turned the last corner and came 
line 2289=>suddenly  right  into  an  open  space, where  the  light,  after  all  that  time  in  the  dark, 
line 2290=>seemed  dazzlingly  bright.  Really  it  was  only  a  leak  of  sunshine  in  through  a 
line 2291=>doorway, where a great door, a stone door, was left standing open. 
line 2292=>Bilbo  blinked,  and  then  suddenly  he  saw  the  goblins:  goblins  in  full  armour 
line 2293=>with drawn swords sitting just inside the door, and watching it with wide eyes, and 
line 2294=>watching the passage that led to it. They were aroused, alert, ready for anything. 
line 2295=>They saw him sooner than he saw them. Yes, they saw him. Whether it was .an 
line 2296=>accident,  or  a  last  trick  of  the  ring  before  it  took  a  new master,  it was  not  on  his 
line 2297=>finger. With yells of delight the goblins rushed upon him. 
line 2298=>A  pang  of  fear  and  loss,  like  an  echo  of  Gollum's  misery,  smote  Bilbo,  and 
line 2299=>forgetting even  to draw his sword he struck his hands  into his pockets. And- there 
line 2300=>was  the  ring  still,  in  his  left  pocket,  and  it  slipped  on  his  finger.  The  goblins 
line 2301=>stopped  short.  They  could  not  see  a  sign  of  him.  He  had  vanished.  They  yelled 
line 2302=>twice as loud as before, but not so delightedly.  
line 2303=>"Where is it?" they cried. 
line 2304=>"Go back up the passage!" some shouted. 
line 2305=>"This way!" some yelled. "That way!" others yelled. 
line 2306=>"Look out for the door," bellowed the captain. 
line 2307=>Whistles  blew,  armour  clashed,  swords  rattled,  goblins  cursed  and  swore  and 
line 2308=>ran hither and thither, falling over one another and getting very angry. There was a 
line 2309=>terrible outcry, to-do, and disturbance. 
line 2310=>Bilbo was  dreadfully  frightened,  but  he  had  the  sense  to  understand what  had 
line 2311=>happened and to sneak behind a big barrel which held drink for the goblin-guards, 
line 2312=>and  so  get  out  of  the  way  and  avoid  being  bumped  into,  trampled  to  death,  or 
line 2313=>caught by feel. 
line 2314=>"I must  get  to  the  door,  I must  get  to  the  door!"  he  kept  on  saying  to  himself, 
line 2315=>but  it was  a  long  time  before  he ventured  to  try. Then  it was  like a horrible game 
line 2316=>of  blind-man's  buff.  The  place  was  full  of  goblins  running  about,  and  the  poor 
line 2317=>little  hobbit  dodged  this  way  and  that,  was  knocked  over  by  a  goblin  who  could 
line 2318=>not  make  out  what  he  had  bumped  into,  scrambled  away  on  all  fours,  slipped 
line 2319=>between the legs of the captain just in time, got up, and ran for the door.  
line 2320=>It  was  still  ajar,  but  a  goblin  had  pushed  it  nearly  to.  Bilbo  struggled  but  he 
line 2321=>could  not  move  it.  He  tried  to  squeeze  through  the  crack.  He  squeezed  and 
line 2322=>
line 2323=>####-squeezed, and he  stuck!  It was awful. His buttons had got wedged on  the edge of 
line 2324=>the  door  and  the  door-post.  He  could  see  outside  into  the  open  air:  there  were  a 
line 2325=>few  steps  running  down  into  a  narrow  valley  between  tall  mountains;  the  sun 
line 2326=>came  out  from  behind  a  cloud  and  shone  bright  on  the  outside  of  the  door-but he 
line 2327=>could not get through. 
line 2328=>Suddenly  one  of  the  goblins  inside  shouted:  "There  is  a  shadow  by  the  door. 
line 2329=>Something is outside!" 
line 2330=>Bilbo's  heart  jumped  into  his mouth. He  gave  a  terrific  squirm. Buttons burst 
line 2331=>off in all directions. He was through, with a torn coat and waistcoat, leaping down 
line 2332=>the steps  like a goat, while bewildered goblins were still picking up his nice brass 
line 2333=>buttons on the doorstep. 
line 2334=>Of course they soon came down after him, hooting and hallooing, and hunting 
line 2335=>among  the  trees. But  they  don't  like  the  sun:  it makes  their  legs wobble  and  their 
line 2336=>heads giddy. They could not find Bilbo with the ring on, slipping in and out of the 
line 2337=>shadow of  the  trees,  running quick and quiet, and keeping out of  the sun; so soon 
line 2338=>they went back grumbling and cursing to guard the door. Bilbo had escaped. 
line 2339=> 
line 2340=>
line 2341=>####-<h4>Chapter 6 </h4> <br>
line 2342=>
line 2343=>Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire 
line 2344=>
line 2345=> 
line 2346=>Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost 
line 2347=>hood,  cloak,  food,  pony,  his  buttons  and  his  friends. He wandered  on  and  on,  till 
line 2348=>the  sun  began  to  sink westwards-behind  the mountains. Their shadows fell across 
line 2349=>Bilbo's  path,  and  he  looked  back.  Then  he  looked  forward  and  could  see  before 
line 2350=>him  only  ridges  and  slopes  falling  towards  lowlands  and  plains  glimpsed 
line 2351=>occasionally between the trees. 
line 2352=>"Good  heavens!"  he  exclaimed.  "I  seem  to  have  got  right  to  the  other  side  of 
line 2353=>the Misty Mountains,  right  to  the  edge  of  the Land Beyond! Where  and O where 
line 2354=>can  Gandalf  and  the  dwarves  have  got  to?  I  only  hope  to  goodness  they  are  not 
line 2355=>still back there in the power of the goblins!" 
line 2356=>He  still wandered on, out of  the  little high valley, over  its edge, and down  the 
line 2357=>slopes beyond; but all the while a very uncomfortable thought was growing inside 
line 2358=>him.  He  wondered  whether  he  ought  not,  now  he  had  the magic  ring,  to  go  back 
line 2359=>into  the  horrible,  horrible,  tunnels  and  look  for  his  friends.  He  had  just made  up 
line 2360=>his  mind  that  it  was  his  duty,  that  he  must  turn  back-and  very miserable  he  felt 
line 2361=>about it-when he heard voices. 
line 2362=>He  stopped  and  listened.  It  did  not  sound  like  goblins;  so  he  crept  forward 
line 2363=>carefully. He was  on  a  stony  path winding  downwards with  a  rocky wall.  on  the 
line 2364=>left hand; on the other side the ground sloped away and there were dells below the 
line 2365=>level  of  the  path  overhung with  bushes  and  low  trees.  In  one  of  these  dells  under 
line 2366=>the bushes people were talking. 
line 2367=>He crept still nearer, and suddenly he saw peering between  two big boulders a 
line 2368=>head with a red hood on:  it was Balin doing  look-out. He could have clapped and 
line 2369=>shouted  for  joy,  but  he  did  not.  He  had  still  got  the  ring  on,  for  fear  of  meeting 
line 2370=>something unexpected and unpleasant, and he saw that Balin was looking straight 
line 2371=>at him without noticing him. 
line 2372=>"I will  give  them  all  a  surprise,"  he  thought,  as  he  crawled  into  the  bushes at 
line 2373=>the edge of the dell. Gandalf was arguing with the dwarves. They were discussing 
line 2374=>all  that  had  happened  to  them  in  the  tunnels,  and  wondering  and  debating  what 
line 2375=>they were  to  do  now. The  dwarves were  grumbling,  and Gandalf was  saying  that 
line 2376=>they could not possibly go on with their journey leaving Mr. Baggins in the hands 
line 2377=>of  the  goblins,  without  trying  to  find  out  if  he  was  alive  or  dead,  and  without 
line 2378=>trying to rescue him. 
line 2379=>
line 2380=>####-"After  all  he  is  my  friend,"  said  the  wizard,  "and  not  a  bad  little  chap.  I  feel 
line 2381=>responsible for him. I wish to goodness you had not lost him." 
line 2382=>The  dwarves  wanted  to  know  why  he  had  ever  been  brought  at  all,  why  he 
line 2383=>could not  stick  to his  friends  and  come  along with  them,  and why  the wizard had 
line 2384=>not chosen someone with more sense. "He has been more trouble than use so far," 
line 2385=>said  one.  "If  we  have  got  to'  go  back  now  into  those  abominable  tunnels  to  look 
line 2386=>for him, then drat him, I say." 
line 2387=>Gandalf answered angrily: "I brought him, and  I don't bring  things  that are of 
line 2388=>no use. Either you help me to look for him, or I go and leave you here to get out of 
line 2389=>the mess as best you can yourselves. If we can only find him again, you will thank 
line 2390=>me before all is over. Whatever did you want to go and drop him for, Dori?" 
line 2391=>"You would  have  dropped  him,"  said Dori,  "if a goblin had suddenly grabbed 
line 2392=>your  leg  from  behind  in  the  dark,  tripped  up  your  feet,  and  kicked  you  in  the 
line 2393=>back!" 
line 2394=>"Then why didn't you pick him up again?" 
line 2395=>"Good  heavens!  Can  you  ask!  Goblins  fighting  and  biting  in  the  dark, 
line 2396=>everybody falling over bodies  and hitting one another! You nearly chopped off my 
line 2397=>head  with  Glamdring,  and  Thorin Was  stabbing  here  there  and  everywhere  with 
line 2398=>Orcrist.  All  of  a  sudden  you  gave  one  of  your  blinding  flashes,  and  we  saw  the 
line 2399=>goblins running back yelping. You shouted 'follow me everybody!' and everybody 
line 2400=>ought  to  have  followed. We  thought  everybody  had. There was  no  time  to  count, 
line 2401=>as  you  know  quite  well,  till  we  had  dashed  through  the  gate-guards,  out  of  the 
line 2402=>lower  door,  and  helter-skelter  down  here.  And  here  we  are-without  the  burglar, 
line 2403=>confusticate him!" 
line 2404=>"And  here's  the  burglar!"  said  Bilbo  stepping  down  into  the  middle  of  them, 
line 2405=>and slipping off the ring. 
line 2406=>Bless  me,  how  they  jumped!  Then  they  shouted  with  surprise  and  delight. 
line 2407=>Gandalf was as astonished as any of  them, but probably more pleased than all the 
line 2408=>others. He called to Balin and told him what he thought of a look-out man who let 
line 2409=>people  walk  right  into  them  like  that  without  warning.  It  is  a  fact  that  Bilbo's 
line 2410=>reputation  went  up  a  very  great  deal  with  the  dwarves  after  this.  If  they had  still 
line 2411=>doubted  that  he  was  really  a  first-class  burglar,  in  spite  of Gandalf's words,  they 
line 2412=>doubted  no  longer. Balin was  the most  puzzled  of  all;  but  everyone  said  it was  a 
line 2413=>very clever bit of work. 
line 2414=>Indeed Bilbo was  so  pleased with  their  praise  that he just chuckled inside and 
line 2415=>said nothing whatever about  the  ring; and when  they asked him how he did  it, he 
line 2416=>said: "O, just crept along, you know-very carefully and quietly." 
line 2417=>
line 2418=>####-"Well,  it  is  the  first  time  that  even  a  mouse  has  crept  along  carefully  and 
line 2419=>quietly  under my  very  nose  and  not  been  spotted,"  said Balin,  "and  I  take  off my 
line 2420=>hood to you." Which he did. 
line 2421=>"Balin at your service," said he. 
line 2422=>"Your servant, Mr. Baggins," said Bilbo. 
line 2423=>Then  they  wanted  to  know  all  about  his  adventures  after  they  had  lost  him, 
line 2424=>and  he  sat  down  and  told  them  everything-except  about  the  finding  of  the  ring 
line 2425=>("not  just  now"  he  thought).  They  were  particularly  interested  in  the  riddle-
line 2426=>competition, and shuddered most appreciatively at his description of Gollum. 
line 2427=>"And  then  I  couldn't  think  of  any  other  question with  him  sitting  beside me," 
line 2428=>ended Bilbo; "so I said  'what's in my pocket?' And he couldn't guess in three goes. 
line 2429=>So I said: 'what about your promise? Show me the way out!' But he came at me to 
line 2430=>kill  me,  and  I  ran,  and  fell  over,  and  he missed me  in  the  dark.  Then  I  followed 
line 2431=>him,  because  I  heard  him  talking  to  himself.  He  thought  I  really  knew  the  way 
line 2432=>out,  and  so  he  was  making  for  it.  And  then  he  sat  down  in  the  entrance,  and  I 
line 2433=>could not get by. So I jumped over him and escaped, and ran down to the gate." 
line 2434=>"What about guards?" they asked. "Weren't there any?" 
line 2435=>"O yes! lots of them; but I dodged 'em. I got stuck in the door, which was only 
line 2436=>open a crack, and  I  lost  lots of buttons," he  said  sadly  looking at his  torn clothes. 
line 2437=>"But I squeezed through all right-and here I am." 
line 2438=>The  dwarves  looked  at  him  with  quite  a  new  respect,  when  he  talked  about 
line 2439=>dodging  guards,  jumping  over  Gollum,  and  squeezing  through,  as  if  it  was  not 
line 2440=>very difficult or very alarming. 
line 2441=>"What  did  I  tell  you?"  said  Gandalf  laughing.  "Mr.  Baggins  has more  about 
line 2442=>him than you guess." He gave Bilbo a queer look from under his bushy eyebrows, 
line 2443=>as he said this, and the hobbit wondered if he guessed at the part of his tale that he 
line 2444=>had left out. 
line 2445=>Then he had questions of his own to ask, for if Gandalf had explained it all by 
line 2446=>now  to  the  dwarves,  Bilbo  had  not  heard  it.  He  wanted  to  know  how  the  wizard 
line 2447=>had turned up again, and where they had all got to now.  
line 2448=>The wizard, to tell the truth, never minded explaining his cleverness more than 
line 2449=>once, so now he had told Bilbo that both he and Elrond had been well aware of the 
line 2450=>presence of evil goblins  in  that part of  the mountains. But  their main gate used  to 
line 2451=>come out on a different pass, one more easy to travel by, so that they often caught 
line 2452=>people  benighted  near  their  gates. Evidently  people  had  given  up  going  that way, 
line 2453=>and  the  goblins  must  have  opened  their  new  entrance  at  the  top  of  the  pass  the 
line 2454=>dwarves had taken, quite recently, because it had been found quite safe up to now.  
line 2455=>
line 2456=>####-"I must see if I can't find a more or less decent giant to block it up again," said 
line 2457=>Gandalf, "or soon there will be no getting over the mountains at all." 
line 2458=>As  soon  as Gandalf  had  heard Bilbo's  yell  he  realized what  had  happened.  In 
line 2459=>the flash which killed the goblins that were grabbing him he had nipped inside the 
line 2460=>crack, just as it snapped to. He followed after the drivers and prisoners right to the 
line 2461=>edge  of  the  great  hall,  and  there  he  sat  down  and  worked  up  the  best  magic  he 
line 2462=>could in the shadows. 
line 2463=>"A very ticklish business, it was," he said. "Touch and go!" 
line 2464=>But,  of  course,  Gandalf  had  made  a  special  study  of  bewitchments  with  fire 
line 2465=>and  lights (even  the hobbit had never forgotten  the magic fireworks at Old Took's 
line 2466=>midsummer-eve  parties,  as  you  remember).  The  rest  we  all  know  -  except  that 
line 2467=>Gandalf knew all about  the back-door, as the goblins called the lower gate, where 
line 2468=>Bilbo lost his buttons. As a matter of fact it was well known to anybody who was 
line 2469=>acquainted with this part of the mountains; but it took a wizard to keep his head in 
line 2470=>the tunnels and guide them in the right direction. 
line 2471=>"They made  that  gate  ages  ago,"  he  said,  "partly  for  a way  of  escape,  if  they 
line 2472=>needed one; partly as a way out into the lands beyond, where they still come in the 
line 2473=>dark and do great damage. They guard  it always and no one has ever managed to 
line 2474=>block it up. They will guard it doubly after this," he laughed. 
line 2475=>All  the  others  laughed  too.  After  all  they  had  lost  a  good  deal,  but  they  had 
line 2476=>killed the Great Goblin and a great many others besides, and they had all escaped, 
line 2477=>so they might be said to have had the best of it so far.  
line 2478=>But  the  wizard  called  them  to  their  senses.  "We  must  be  getting  on  at  once, 
line 2479=>now we  are  a  little  rested,"  he  said.  "They will  be  out  after  us  in  hundreds when 
line 2480=>night  comes  on;  and  already  shadows  are  lengthening.  They  can  smell  our 
line 2481=>footsteps  for  hours  and  hours  after  we  have  passed. We  must  be  miles  on  before 
line 2482=>dusk. There will be a bit of moon,  if  it keeps fine, and  that  is  lucky. Not  that  they 
line 2483=>mind the moon much, but it will give us a little light to steer by." 
line 2484=>"O yes!" he said  in answer  to more questions from  the hobbit. "You  lose  track 
line 2485=>of  time  inside  goblin-tunnels.  Today's  Thursday,  and  it  was  Monday  night  or 
line 2486=>Tuesday morning that we were captured. We have gone miles and miles, and come 
line 2487=>right down through the heart of the mountains, and are now on the other side-quite 
line 2488=>a short cut. But we are not at  the point  to which our pass would have brought us; 
line 2489=>we  are  too  far  to  the North,  and  have  some  awkward  country  ahead. And we  are 
line 2490=>still pretty high up. Let's get on!" 
line 2491=> 
line 2492=>
line 2493=>####-"I  am  so dreadfully hungry," groaned Bilbo, who was  suddenly  aware  that he 
line 2494=>had  not  had  a meal  since  the  night  before  the  night  before  last.  Just  think  of  that 
line 2495=>for  a  hobbit!  His  stomach  felt  all  empty  and  loose  and  his  legs  all  wobbly,  now 
line 2496=>that the excitement was over.  
line 2497=>"Can't  help  it,"  said Gandalf,  "unless  you  like  to  go  back  and  ask  the  goblins 
line 2498=>nicely to let you have your pony back and your luggage." 
line 2499=>"No thank you!" said Bilbo. 
line 2500=>"Very well  then, we must  just  tighten our belts  and  trudge on  - or  we shall be 
line 2501=>made into supper, and that will be much worse than having none ourselves." 
line 2502=>As  they went  on  Bilbo  looked  from  side  to  side  for  something  to  eat;  but  the 
line 2503=>blackberries were  still  only  in  flower,  and  of  course  there were  no  nuts,  nor  even 
line 2504=>hawthorn-berries. He nibbled a bit of sorrel, and he drank from a small mountain-
line 2505=>stream that crossed the path, and he ate three wild strawberries that he found on its 
line 2506=>bank, but it was not much good. 
line 2507=>They  still  went  on  and  on.  The  rough  path  disappeared.  The  bushes,  and  the 
line 2508=>long  grasses,  between  the  boulders,  the  patches  of  rabbit-cropped  turf,  the  thyme 
line 2509=>and  the  sage  and  the  marjoram,  and  the  yellow  rockroses  all  vanished,  and  they 
line 2510=>found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the remains of a 
line 2511=>landslide.  When  they  began  to  go  down  this,  rubbish  and  small  pebbles  rolled 
line 2512=>away  from  their  feet;  soon  larger  bits  of  split  stone  went  clattering  down  and 
line 2513=>started  other  pieces  below  them  slithering  and  rolling;  then  lumps  of  rocks  were 
line 2514=>disturbed and bounded off, crashing down with a dust and a noise. Before long the 
line 2515=>whole  slope  above  them  and  below  them  seemed  on  the  move,  and  they  were 
line 2516=>sliding  away,  huddled  all  together,  in  a  fearful  confusion  of  slipping,  rattling, 
line 2517=>cracking slabs and stones. 
line 2518=>It  was  the  trees  at  the  bottom  that  saved  them.  They  slid  into  the  edge  of  a 
line 2519=>climbing  wood  of  pines  that  here  stood  right  up  the  mountain  slope  from  the 
line 2520=>deeper  darker  forests  of  the  valleys  below.  Some  caught  hold  of  the  trunks  and 
line 2521=>swung  themselves  into  lower  branches,  some  (like  the  little  hobbit)  got  behind  a 
line 2522=>tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks. Soon the danger was over, the slide 
line 2523=>had  stopped,  and  the  last  faint  crashes  could  be  heard  as  the  largest  of  the 
line 2524=>disturbed  stones  went  bounding  and  spinning  among  the  bracken  and  the  pine-
line 2525=>roots far below.  
line 2526=>"Well!  that  has  got  us  on  a  bit,"  said  Gandalf;  "and  even  goblins  tracking  us 
line 2527=>will have a job to come down here quietly." 
line 2528=>
line 2529=>####-"I  daresay,"  grumbled Bombur;  "but  they won't  find  it  difficult  to  send  stones 
line 2530=>bouncing  down  on  our  heads."  The  dwarves  (and  Bilbo)  were  feeling  far  from 
line 2531=>happy, and were rubbing their bruised and damaged legs and feet. 
line 2532=>"Nonsense!  We  are  going  to  turn  aside  here  out  of  the  path  of  the  slide.  We 
line 2533=>must  be  quick! Look  at  the  light!" The  sun  had  long  gone behind  the mountains. 
line 2534=>Already  the  shadows  were  deepening  about  them,  though  far  away  through  the 
line 2535=>trees and over  the black  tops of  those growing  lower down  they could still see  the 
line 2536=>evening  lights  on  the  plains  beyond. They  limped  along  now  as  fast  as  they were 
line 2537=>able  down  the  gentle  slopes  of  a  pine  forest  in  a  slanting  path  leading  steadily 
line 2538=>southwards. At  times  they were pushing  through a sea of bracken with  tall  fronds 
line 2539=>rising  right  above  the  hobbit's  head;  at  times  they  were  marching  along  quiet  as 
line 2540=>quiet  over  a  floor  of  pine-needles;  and  all  the  while  the  forest-gloom got heavier 
line 2541=>and  the  forest-silence deeper. There was no wind that evening to bring even a sea-
line 2542=>sighing into the branches of the trees. 
line 2543=> 
line 2544=>"Must we go any further?" asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only 
line 2545=>just  see  Thorin's  beard  wagging  beside  him,  and  so  quiet  that  he  could  hear  the 
line 2546=>dwarves'  breathing  like  a  loud  noise.  "My  toes  are  all  bruised  and  bent,  and  my 
line 2547=>legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack." 
line 2548=>"A bit further," said Gandalf. 
line 2549=>After  what  seemed  ages  further  they  came  suddenly  to  an  opening  where  no 
line 2550=>trees  grew.  The  moon  was  up  and  was  shining  into  the  clearing.  Somehow  it 
line 2551=>struck  all of  them  as not  at  all  a nice place,  although  there was nothing wrong  to 
line 2552=>see. 
line 2553=>All  of a sudden  they heard a howl away down hill, a  long shuddering howl. It 
line 2554=>was  answered  by  another  away  to  the  right  and  a  good  deal  nearer  to  them;  then 
line 2555=>by  another  not  far  away  to  the  left.  It  was  wolves  howling  at  the  moon,  wolves 
line 2556=>gathering together! 
line 2557=>There were no wolves living near Mr. Baggins' hole at home, but he knew that 
line 2558=>noise.  He  had  had  it  described  to  him  often  enough  in  tales.  One  of  his  elder 
line 2559=>cousins  (on  the  Took  side),  who  had  been  a  great  traveller,  used  to  imitate  it  to 
line 2560=>frighten him. To hear  it  out  in  the forest under  the moon was  too much for Bilbo. 
line 2561=>Even  magic  rings  are  not  much  use  against  wolves-especially  against  the  evil 
line 2562=>packs that lived under the shadow of the goblin-infested mountains, over the Edge 
line 2563=>of  the Wild  on  the  borders  of  the  unknown. Wolves of  that sort smell keener  than 
line 2564=>goblins, and do not need to see you to catch you! 
line 2565=>
line 2566=>####-"What  shall  we  do,  what  shall  we  do!"  he  cried.  "Escaping  goblins  to  be 
line 2567=>caught  by wolves!"  he  said,  and  it  became  a  proverb,  though we  now  say  'out  of 
line 2568=>the frying-pan into the fire' in the same sort of uncomfortable situations. 
line 2569=>"Up the trees quick!" cried Gandalf; and they ran to the trees at the edge of the 
line 2570=>glade,  hunting  for  those  that  had  branches  fairly  low,  or  were  slender  enough  to 
line 2571=>swarm  up.  They  found  them  as  quick  as  ever  they  could,  you  can  guess;  and  up 
line 2572=>they went as high as ever  they could  trust  the branches. You would have  laughed 
line 2573=>(from a safe distance), if you had seen the dwarves sitting up in the trees with their 
line 2574=>beards dangling down, like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys. 
line 2575=>Fili and Kili were at the top of a tall larch like an enormous Christmas tree. Dori, 
line 2576=>Nori,  On,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  more  comfortable  in  a  huge  pine  with  regular 
line 2577=>branches  sticking  out  at  intervals  like  the  spokes  of  a  wheel.  Bifur,  Bofur, 
line 2578=>Bombur,  and  Thorin  were  in  another.  Dwalin  and  Balin  had  swarmed  up  a  tall 
line 2579=>slender fir with few branches and were  trying  to find a place  to sit  in  the greenery 
line 2580=>of  the  topmost  boughs.  Gandalf,  who  was  a  good  deal  taller  than  the  others,  had 
line 2581=>found  a  tree  into  which  they  could  not  climb,  a  large  pine  standing  at  the  very 
line 2582=>edge  of  the  glade. He was  quite  hidden  in  its  boughs,  but  you  could  see  his  eyes 
line 2583=>gleaming in the moon as he peeped out. 
line 2584=>And Bilbo? He could not get into any tree, and was scuttling about from trunk 
line 2585=>to trunk, like a rabbit that has lost its hole and has a dog after it. 
line 2586=>"You've left the burglar behind again}" said Nori to Dori looking down. 
line 2587=>"I  can't  be  always  carrying  burglars  on  my  back,"  said  Dori,  "down  tunnels 
line 2588=>and up trees! What do you think I am? A porter?" 
line 2589=>"He'll be eaten if we don't 'do something," said Thorin, for there were howls all 
line 2590=>around  them  now,  getting  nearer  and  nearer.  "Dori!"  he  called,  for  Dori  was 
line 2591=>lowest down in the easiest tree, "be quick, and give Mr. Baggins a hand up!" 
line 2592=>Dori was really a decent fellow in spite of his grumbling. Poor Bilbo could not 
line 2593=>reach  his  hand  even  when  he  climbed  down  to  the  bottom  branch  and  hung  his 
line 2594=>arm down as far as ever he could. So Dori actually climbed out of the tree and let 
line 2595=>Bilbo scramble up and stand on his back. 
line 2596=>Just  at  that  moment  the  wolves  trotted  howling  into  the  clearing.  All  of  a 
line 2597=>sudden  there  were  hundreds  of  eyes  looking  at  them.  Still  Dori  did  not  let  Bilbo 
line 2598=>down.  He  waited  till  he  had  clambered  off  his  shoulders  into  the  branches,  and 
line 2599=>then he jumped for the branches himself. Only just in time! A wolf snapped- at his 
line 2600=>cloak as he swung up, and nearly got him. In a minute there was a whole pack of 
line 2601=>them yelping all round  the  tree and  leaping up at  the  trunk, with eyes blazing and 
line 2602=>tongues hanging out. 
line 2603=>
line 2604=>####-But  even  the  wild  Wargs  (for  so  the  evil  wolves  over  the  Edge  of  the  Wild 
line 2605=>were named) cannot climb  trees. For a  time  they were  safe.  'Luckily  it was warm 
line 2606=>and not windy. Trees are not very comfortable to sit in for long at any time; but in 
line 2607=>the  cold  and  the wind, with wolves  all  round  below waiting  for  you,  they  can  be 
line 2608=>perfectly miserable places. 
line 2609=>This  glade  in  the  ring  of  trees  was  evidently  a  meeting-place  of  the  wolves. 
line 2610=>More  and  more  kept  coming  in.  They  left  guards  at  the  foot  of  the  tree  in which 
line 2611=>Dori  and  Bilbo  were,  and  then  went  sniffling  about  till  they  had  smelt  out  every 
line 2612=>tree that had anyone in it. These they guarded too, while all the rest (hundreds and 
line 2613=>hundreds  it  seemed) went  and  sat  in  a  great  circle  in  the  glade;  and  in the middle 
line 2614=>of  the circle was a great grey wolf. He  spoke  to  them  in  the dreadful  language of 
line 2615=>the  Wargs.  Gandalf  understood  it.  Bilbo  did  not,  but  it  sounded  terrible  to  him, 
line 2616=>and  as  if  all  their  talk  was  about  cruel  and  wicked  things,  as  it  was.  Every  now 
line 2617=>and then all the Wargs in the circle would answer their grey chief all together, and 
line 2618=>their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree. 
line 2619=>I  will  tell  you  what  Gandalf  heard,  though  Bilbo  did  not  understand  it.  The 
line 2620=>Wargs  and  the  goblins  often  helped  one  another  in wicked  deeds. Goblins  do  not 
line 2621=>usually venture very  far  from  their mountains, unless  they  are driven out  and  are 
line 2622=>looking  for  new  homes,  or  are marching  to  war  (which  I  am  glad  to  say  has  not 
line 2623=>happened for a long while). But in those days they sometimes used to go on raids, 
line 2624=>especially to get food or slaves to work for them. Then they often got the Wargs to 
line 2625=>help  and  shared  the  plunder with  them. Sometimes  they  rode  on wolves  like men 
line 2626=>do  on  horses.  Now  it  seemed  that  a  great  goblin-raid  had  been  planned  for  that 
line 2627=>very  night.  The  Wargs  had  come  to  meet  the  goblins  and  the  goblins  were  late. 
line 2628=>The  reason,  no  doubt,  was  the  death  of  the  Great  Goblin,  and  all  the  excitement 
line 2629=>caused  by  the  dwarves  and  Bilbo  and  the  wizard,  for  whom  they  were  probably 
line 2630=>still hunting. 
line 2631=>In spite of  the dangers of  this  far  land bold men had of  late been making  their 
line 2632=>way  back  into  it  from  the  South,  cutting  down  trees,  and  building  themselves 
line 2633=>places to live in among the more pleasant woods in the valleys and along the river-
line 2634=>shores. There were many of  them, and  they were brave and well-armed, and even 
line 2635=>the Wargs dared not attack  them  if  there were many  together, or  in  the bright day. 
line 2636=>But  now  they  had  planned with  the  goblins'  help  to  come  by  night  upon  some  of 
line 2637=>the  villages nearest  the mountains.  If  their plan had been carried out,  there would 
line 2638=>have been none  left  there next day;  all would have been killed  except  the  few  the 
line 2639=>goblins kept from the wolves and carried back as prisoners to their caves. 
line 2640=>
line 2641=>####-This was dreadful talk to listen to, not only because of the brave woodmen and 
line 2642=>their  wives  and  children,  but  also  because  of  the  danger  which  now  threatened 
line 2643=>Gandalf  and his  friends. The Wargs were  angry  and puzzled  at  finding  them here 
line 2644=>in  their  very meeting-place. They  thought  they were  friends of  the woodmen, and 
line 2645=>were  come  to  spy  on  them,  and  would  take  news  of  their  plans  down  into  the 
line 2646=>valleys,  and  then  the  goblins  and  the wolves would  have  to  fight  a  terrible  battle 
line 2647=>instead  of  capturing  prisoners  and  devouring  people  waked  suddenly  from  their 
line 2648=>sleep. So  the Wargs  had  no  intention  of  going  away  and  letting  the  people  up  the 
line 2649=>trees escape, at any rate not until morning. And long before that, they said, goblin 
line 2650=>soldiers would be coming down  from  the mountains; and goblins can climb  trees, 
line 2651=>or cut them down. 
line 2652=>Now you can understand why Gandalf, listening to their growling and yelping, 
line 2653=>began  to be dreadfully afraid, wizard  though he was, and  to feel  that  they were  in 
line 2654=>a very bad place, and had not yet escaped at all. All  the same he was not going to 
line 2655=>let them have it all their own way, though he could not do very much stuck up in a 
line 2656=>tall  tree  with  wolves  all  round  on  the  ground  below.  He  gathered  the  huge 
line 2657=>pinecones  from  the  branches  of  his  tree.  Then  he  set  one  alight  with  bright  blue 
line 2658=>fire, and  threw  it whizzing down among  the circle of  the wolves.  It  struck one on 
line 2659=>the back, and  immediately his shaggy coat caught  fire, and he was  leaping  to and 
line 2660=>fro  yelping  horribly.  Then  another  came  and  another,  one  in  blue  flames,  one  in 
line 2661=>red,  another  in  green.  They  burst  on  the  ground  in  the  middle  of  the  circle  and 
line 2662=>went off in coloured sparks and smoke. A specially large one hit the chief wolf on 
line 2663=>the  nose,  and  he  leaped  in  the  air  ten  feet,  and  then  rushed  round  and  round  the 
line 2664=>circle biting and snapping even at the other wolves in his anger and fright. 
line 2665=>The  dwarves  and  Bilbo  shouted  and  cheered.  The  rage  of  the  wolves  was 
line 2666=>terrible  to  see,  and  the  commotion  they  made  filled  all  the  forest.  Wolves  are  
line 2667=>afraid of fire at all times, but this was a most horrible and uncanny fire. If a spark 
line 2668=>got  in  their coats  it stuck and burned  into  them, and unless  they  rolled over quick 
line 2669=>they  were  soon  all  in  flames.  Very  soon  all  about  the  glade  wolves  were  rolling 
line 2670=>over  and over  to put out  the  sparks on  their backs, while  those  that  were burning 
line 2671=>were running about howling and setting others alight, till their own friends chased 
line 2672=>them  away  and  they  fled  off  down  the  slopes  crying  and  yammering  and  looking 
line 2673=>for water.  
line 2674=> 
line 2675=>"What's  all  this  uproar  in  the  forest  tonight?"  said  the  Lord  of  the  Eagles. He 
line 2676=>was  sitting,  black  in  the moonlight,  on  the  top  of  a  lonely  pinnacle  of  rock  at  the 
line 2677=>
line 2678=>####-eastern edge of  the mountains. "I hear wolves' voices! Are  the goblins at mischief 
line 2679=>in the woods?" 
line 2680=>He swept up  into  the air, and  immediately  two of his guards  from the rocks at 
line 2681=>either hand  leaped up  to  follow him. They circled up  in  the sky and  looked down 
line 2682=>upon  the  ring  of  the Wargs,  a  tiny  spot  far  far  below.  But  eagles  have  keen  eyes 
line 2683=>and  can  see  small  things  at  a  great  distance.  The  lord  of  the  eagles  of  the  Misty 
line 2684=>Mountains had eyes  that could  look at  the  sun unblinking, and could  see a  rabbit 
line 2685=>moving on the ground a mile below even in the moonlight. So though he could not 
line 2686=>see  the  people  in  the  trees,  he  could make  out  the  commotion  among  the wolves 
line 2687=>and  see  the  tiny  flashes  of  fire,  and  hear  the  howling  and  yelping  come  up  faint 
line 2688=>from far beneath him. Also he could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears and 
line 2689=>helmets,  as  long  lines  of  the wicked  folk  crept  down  the  hillsides  from  their  gate 
line 2690=>and wound into the wood. 
line 2691=>Eagles are not kindly birds. Some are cowardly and cruel. But the ancient race 
line 2692=>of  the  northern  mountains  were  the  greatest  of  all  birds;  they  were  proud  and 
line 2693=>strong and noble-hearted. They did not love goblins, or fear them. When they took 
line 2694=>any  notice  of  them at all (which was seldom, for they did not eat such creatures ), 
line 2695=>they  swooped on  them and drove  them  shrieking back  to  their caves, and  stopped 
line 2696=>whatever  wickedness  they  were  doing.  The  goblins  hated  the  eagles  and  feared 
line 2697=>them, but could not reach their lofty seats, or drive them from the mountains. 
line 2698=>Tonight  the  Lord  of  the  Eagles  was  filled  with  curiosity  to  know  what  was 
line 2699=>afoot;  so  he  summoned  many  other  eagles  to  him,  and  they  flew  away  from  the 
line 2700=>mountains,  and  slowly  circling  ever  round  and  round  they  came  down,  down, 
line 2701=>down towards the ring of the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins. 
line 2702=>A  very  good  thing  too!  Dreadful  things  had  been  going  on  down  there.  The 
line 2703=>wolves  that  had  caught  fire  and  fled  into  the  forest  had  set  it  alight  in  several 
line 2704=>places.  It  was  high  summer,  and  on  this  eastern  side  of  the  mountains  there  had 
line 2705=>been little rain for some time. Yellowing bracken, fallen branches, deep-piled pine-
line 2706=>needles, and here and there dead trees, were soon in flames. All round the clearing 
line 2707=>of  the  Wargs  fire  was  leaping.  But  the  wolf-guards  did  not  leave  the  trees. 
line 2708=>Maddened and angry they were leaping and howling round the trunks, and cursing 
line 2709=>the  dwarves  in  their  horrible  language,  with  their  tongues  hanging  out,  and  their 
line 2710=>eyes shining as red and fierce as the flames. 
line 2711=>Then  suddenly  goblins  came  running  up  yelling.  They  thought  a  battle  with 
line 2712=>the  woodmen  was  going  on;  but  they  goon  learned  what  had  really  happened. 
line 2713=>Some  of  them  actually  sat  down  and  laughed.  Others  waved  their  spears  and 
line 2714=>
line 2715=>####-clashed  the  shafts  against  their  shields.  Goblins  are  not  afraid  of  fire,  and  they 
line 2716=>soon had a plan which seemed to them most amusing. 
line 2717=>Some got all the wolves together in a pack. Some stacked fern and brushwood 
line 2718=>round  the  tree-trunks.  Others  rushed  round  and  stamped  and  beat,  and  beat  and 
line 2719=>stamped,  until  nearly  all  the  flames were  put  out-but  they did not put out  the  fire 
line 2720=>nearest  to  the  trees  where  the  dwarves  were.  That  fire  they  fed  with  leaves  and 
line 2721=>dead  branches  and  bracken.  Soon  they  had  a  ring  of  smoke  and  flame  all  round 
line 2722=>the dwarves, a ring which they kept from spreading outwards; but it closed slowly 
line 2723=>in,  till  the  running  fire  was  licking  the  fuel  piled  under  the  trees.  Smoke  was  in 
line 2724=>Bilbo's  eyes,  he  could  feel  the  heat  of  the  flames;  and  through  the  reek  he  could 
line 2725=>see  the  goblins  dancing  round  and  round  in  a  circle  like  people  round  a 
line 2726=>midsummer  bonfire.  Outside  the  ring  of  dancing  warriors  with  spears  and  axes 
line 2727=>stood the wolves at a respectful distance, watching and waiting. 
line 2728=>He could hear the goblins beginning a horrible song: 
line 2729=> 
line 2730=>
line 2731=>Fifteen birds in five firtrees, 
line 2732=>their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze! 
line 2733=>But, funny little birds, they had no wings! 
line 2734=>O what shall we do with the funny little things?  
line 2735=>Roast 'em alive, or stew them in a pot; 
line 2736=>fry them, boil them and eat them hot?  
line 2737=>
line 2738=> 
line 2739=>Then  they  stopped  and  shouted  out:  "Fly  away  little  birds!  Fly  away  if  you 
line 2740=>can! Come down little birds, or you will get roasted in your nests! Sing, sing little 
line 2741=>birds! Why don't you sing?" 
line 2742=>"Go  away!  little  boys!"  shouted Gandalf  in  answer.  "It  isn't  bird-nesting time. 
line 2743=>Also naughty little boys that play with fire get punished." He said it to make them 
line 2744=>angry,  and  to  show  them  he was  not  frightened  of  them-though of course he was, 
line 2745=>wizard though he was. But they took no notice, and they went on singing. 
line 2746=> 
line 2747=>
line 2748=>Burn, burn tree and fern! 
line 2749=>Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch 
line 2750=>To light the night for our delight, 
line 2751=>Ya hey! 
line 2752=> 
line 2753=>Bake and toast 'em, fry and roast 'em 
line 2754=>till beards blaze, and eyes glaze; 
line 2755=>till hair smells and skins crack, 
line 2756=>fat melts, and bones black 
line 2757=>
line 2758=>####-in cinders lie 
line 2759=>beneath the sky! 
line 2760=> 
line 2761=>So dwarves shall die, 
line 2762=>and light the night for our delight, 
line 2763=>Ya hey! 
line 2764=>Ya-harri-heyl 
line 2765=>Ya hoy! 
line 2766=>
line 2767=> 
line 2768=>And  with  that  Ya  hoy!  the  flames  were  under  Gandalf’s  tree.  In  a moment  it 
line 2769=>spread to the others. The bark caught fire, the lower branches cracked. 
line 2770=>Then  Gandalf  climbed  to  the  top  of  his  tree.  The  sudden  splendour  flashed 
line 2771=>from  his  wand  like  lightning,  as  he  got  ready  to  spring  down  from  on  high  right 
line 2772=>among  the spears of  the goblins. That would have been  the end of him,  though he 
line 2773=>would  probably  have  killed  many  of  them  as  he  came  hurtling  down  like  a 
line 2774=>thunderbolt. But he never leaped. 
line 2775=>Just at that moment the Lord of the Eagles swept down from above, seized him 
line 2776=>in his talons, and was gone. 
line 2777=> 
line 2778=>There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord 
line 2779=>of  the Eagles,  to whom Gandalf had now  spoken. Back  swept  the great birds  that 
line 2780=>were  with  him,  and  down  they  came  like  huge  black  shadows.  The  wolves 
line 2781=>yammered and gnashed  their  teeth;  the goblins yelled and stamped with  rage, and 
line 2782=>flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark 
line 2783=>rush of  their beating wings  smote  them  to  the  floor or drove  them  far  away;  their 
line 2784=>talons  tore  at  goblin  faces.  Other  birds  flew  to  the  tree-tops  and  seized  the 
line 2785=>dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as ever they dared to go. 
line 2786=>Poor  little Bilbo was  very  nearly  left  behind  again! He  just managed  to  catch 
line 2787=>hold of Dori's legs, as Dori was borne off last of all; and they went together above 
line 2788=>the  tumult  and  the  burning,  Bilbo  swinging  in  the  air  with  his  arms  nearly 
line 2789=>breaking. 
line 2790=>Now  far below  the goblins and  the wolves were  scattering  far and wide  in  the 
line 2791=>woods. A few eagles were still circling and sweeping above the battle-ground. The 
line 2792=>flames about  the  trees sprang suddenly up above  the highest branches. They went 
line 2793=>up  in  crackling  fire.  There  was  a  sudden  flurry  of  sparks  and  smoke.  Bilbo  had 
line 2794=>escaped only just in time! 
line 2795=>Soon the light of the burning was faint below, a red twinkle on the black floor; 
line 2796=>and  they  were  high  up  in  the  sky,  rising  all  the  time  in  strong  sweeping circles. 
line 2797=>
line 2798=>####-Bilbo  never  forgot  that  flight,  clinging  onto Dori's  ankles. He moaned  "my  arms, 
line 2799=>my arms!"; but Dori groaned "my poor legs, my poor legs!" 
line 2800=>At  the  best  of  times  heights  made  Bilbo  giddy.  He  used  to  turn  queer  if  he 
line 2801=>looked over the edge of quite a little cliff; and he had never liked ladders, let alone 
line 2802=>trees  (never  having  had  to  escape  from wolves  before).  So  you  can  imagine  how 
line 2803=>his head swam now, when he  looked down between his dangling  toes and saw  the 
line 2804=>dark  lands opening wide underneath him,  touched here and there with the light of 
line 2805=>the moon on a hill-side rock or a stream in the plains. 
line 2806=>The  pale  peaks  of  the mountains were  coming  nearer, moonlit  spikes  of  rock 
line 2807=>sticking  out  of  black  shadows.  Summer  or  not,  it  seemed  very  cold.  He  shut  his 
line 2808=>eyes  and wondered if he could hold on any longer. Then he imagined what would 
line 2809=>happen  if he did not. He  felt  sick. The  flight  ended only  just  in  time  for him,  just 
line 2810=>before  his  arms  gave  way.  He  loosed  Dori's  ankles  with  a  gasp  and  fell  onto  the 
line 2811=>rough  platform  of  an  eagle's  eyrie.  There  he  lay  without  speaking,  and  his 
line 2812=>thoughts were  a mixture  of  surprise  at  being  saved  from  the  fire,  and  fear  lest  he 
line 2813=>fell off that narrow place into the deep shadows on either side. He was feeling very 
line 2814=>queer indeed in his head by this time after the dreadful adventures of the last three 
line 2815=>days with next to nothing to eat, and he found himself saying aloud: "Now I know 
line 2816=>what a piece of bacon feels like when it is suddenly picked out of the pan on a fork 
line 2817=>and put back on the shelf!" 
line 2818=>"No  you  don't!"  be  heard  Dori  answering,  "because  the  bacon  knows  that  it 
line 2819=>will get back in the pan sooner or later; and it is to be hoped we shan't. Also eagles 
line 2820=>aren't forks!" 
line 2821=>"O  no!  Not  a  bit  like  storks-forks,  I mean,"  said Bilbo  sitting up  and  looking 
line 2822=>anxiously  at  the  eagle  who  was  perched  close  by.  He  wondered  what  other 
line 2823=>nonsense he had been  saying, and  if  the eagle would  think  it  rude. You ought not 
line 2824=>to  be  rude  to  an  eagle, when  you  are  only  the  size  of  a  hobbit,  and  are  up  in  his 
line 2825=>eyrie at night! 
line 2826=>The  eagle  only  sharpened  his  beak  on  a  stone  and  trimmed  his  feathers  and 
line 2827=>took no notice. 
line 2828=>Soon  another  eagle  flew  up.  "The  Lord  of  the  Eagles  bids  you  to  bring  your 
line 2829=>prisoners to the Great Shelf," he cried and was off again. The other seized Dori in 
line 2830=>his  claws  and  flew  away  with  him  into  the  night  leaving Bilbo  all  alone. He  had 
line 2831=>just strength  to wonder what  the messenger had meant by  'prisoners,' and  to begin 
line 2832=>to  think  of  being  torn  up  for  supper  like  a  rabbit,  when  his  own  turn  came.  The 
line 2833=>eagle came back, seized him in his talons by the back of his coat, and swooped off. 
line 2834=>This  time  he  flew  only  a  short  way.  Very  soon  Bilbo  was  laid  down,  trembling 
line 2835=>
line 2836=>####-with  fear,  on  a wide  shelf  of  rock  on  the mountain-side. There was no path down 
line 2837=>on to it save by flying; and no path down off it except by jumping over a precipice. 
line 2838=>There  he  found  all  the  others  sitting  with  their  backs  to  the  mountain  wall.  The 
line 2839=>Lord of the Eagles also was there and was speaking to Gandalf. 
line 2840=>It  seemed  that  Bilbo  was  not  going  to  be  eaten  after  all.  The  wizard  and  the 
line 2841=>eagle-lord  appeared  to  know  one  another  slightly,  and  even  to  be  on  friendly 
line 2842=>terms. As a matter of fact Gandalf, who had often been in the mountains, had once 
line 2843=>rendered  a  service  to  the  eagles  and  healed  their  lord  from  an  arrow-wound. So 
line 2844=>you  see  'prisoners'  had  meant  'prisoners  rescued  from  the  goblins'  only,  and  not 
line 2845=>captives  of  the  eagles. As Bilbo  listened  to  the  talk  of Gandalf  he  realized  that  at 
line 2846=>last  they  were  going  to  escape  really  and  truly  from  the  dreadful  mountains.  He 
line 2847=>was  discussing  plans  with  the  Great  Eagle  for  carrying  the  dwarves  and  himself 
line 2848=>and Bilbo far away and setting  them down well on  their  journey across  the plains 
line 2849=>below.  
line 2850=>The Lord of  the Eagles would not  take  them anywhere near where men  lived. 
line 2851=>"They  would  shoot  at  us  with  their  great  bows  of yew," he  said,  "for  they would 
line 2852=>think  we  were  after  their  sheep.  And  at  other  times  they  would  be  right.  No!  we 
line 2853=>are  glad  to  cheat  the  goblins  of  their  sport,  and  glad  to  repay  our  thanks  to  you, 
line 2854=>but we will not risk ourselves for dwarves in the southward plains." 
line 2855=>"Very  well,"  said  Gandalf.  "Take  us  where  and  as  far  as  you  will!  We  are 
line 2856=>already deeply obliged to you. But in the meantime we are famished with hunger." 
line 2857=>"I am nearly dead of it," said Bilbo in a weak little voice that nobody heard. 
line 2858=>"That can perhaps be mended," said the Lord of the Eagles. 
line 2859=>Later on you might have seen a bright fire on  the shelf of rock and  the figures 
line 2860=>of the dwarves round it cooking and making a fine roasting smell. The eagles had 
line 2861=>brought  up  dry  boughs  for  fuel,  and  they  had  brought  rabbits, hares, and a  small 
line 2862=>sheep.  The  dwarves  managed  all  the  preparations.  Bilbo  was  too  weak  to  help, 
line 2863=>and  anyway  he was  not much  good  at  skinning  rabbits  or  cutting  up meat,  being 
line 2864=>used  to  having  it  delivered  by  the  butcher  all  ready  to  cook.  Gandalf,  too,  was 
line 2865=>lying  down  after  doing  his  part  in  setting  the  fire  going,  since Oin  and Gloin  had 
line 2866=>lost their tinder-boxes. (Dwarves have never taken to matches even yet.) 
line 2867=>So  ended  the  adventures  of  the  Misty  Mountains.  Soon  Bilbo's  stomach  was 
line 2868=>feeling full and  comfortable  again,  and he  felt he  could  sleep  contentedly,  though 
line 2869=>really  he  would  have  liked  a  loaf  and  butter  better  than  bits  of  meat  toasted  on 
line 2870=>sticks. He slept curled up on the hard rock more soundly than ever he had done on 
line 2871=>his feather-bed in his own  little hole at home. But all night he dreamed of his own 
line 2872=>
line 2873=>####-house and wandered in his sleep into all his different rooms looking for something 
line 2874=>that he could not find nor remember what it looked like. 
line 2875=> 
line 2876=>
line 2877=>####-<h4>Chapter 7 </h4> <br>
line 2878=>
line 2879=>Queer Lodgings 
line 2880=>
line 2881=> 
line 2882=>The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. He jumped up 
line 2883=>to  look  at  the  time  and  to  go  and  put  his  kettle  on-and  found he was not home at 
line 2884=>all.  So  he  sat  down  and  wished  in  vain  for  a  wash  and  a  brush.  He  did  not  get 
line 2885=>either,  nor  tea  nor  toast  nor  bacon  for  his  breakfast, only cold mutton and  rabbit. 
line 2886=>And after that he had to get ready for a fresh start. 
line 2887=>This time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle's back and cling between his 
line 2888=>wings.  The  air  rushed  over  him  and  he  shut  his  eyes.  The  dwarves  were  crying 
line 2889=>farewells  and  promising  to  repay  the  lord  of  the  eagles  if  ever  they  could,  as  off 
line 2890=>rose  fifteen  great  birds  from  the  mountain's  side.  The  sun  was  still  close  to  the 
line 2891=>eastern  edge  of  things.  The morning was  cool,  and mists were  in  the  valleys  and 
line 2892=>hollows  and  twined  here  and  there  about  the  peaks  and  pinnacles  of  the  hills. 
line 2893=>Bilbo opened  an  eye  to peep  and  saw  that  the birds were  already high up  and  the 
line 2894=>world  was  far  away,  and  the  mountains  were  falling  back  behind  them  into  the 
line 2895=>distance. He shut his eyes again and held on tighter.  
line 2896=>"Don't pinch!" said his eagle. "You need not be frightened like a rabbit, even if 
line 2897=>you  look  rather  like  one.  It  is  a  fair morning  with  little  wind. What  is  finer  than 
line 2898=>flying?" 
line 2899=>Bilbo  would  have  liked  to  say:  "A  warm  bath  and  late  breakfast  on  the  lawn 
line 2900=>afterwards;"  but  he  thought  it  better  to  say  nothing  at  all,  and  to  let  go  his  clutch 
line 2901=>just a tiny bit. 
line 2902=>After  a good while  the  eagles must have  seen  the point  they were making  for, 
line 2903=>'even  from  their  great  height,  for  they  began  to  go  down  circling  round  in  great 
line 2904=>spirals. They did this for a long while, and at last the hobbit opened his eyes again. 
line 2905=>The earth was much nearer, and below  them were  trees  that  looked  like oaks and 
line 2906=>elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But cropping out of 
line 2907=>the ground, right in the path of the stream which looped itself about it, was a great 
line 2908=>rock, almost a hill of stone,  like a  last outpost of  the distant mountains, or a huge 
line 2909=>piece cast miles into the plain by some giant among giants. 
line 2910=>Quickly  now  to  the  top  of  this  rock  the  eagles  swooped  one  by  one  and  set 
line 2911=>down their passengers. 
line 2912=>"Farewell!"  they  cried,  "wherever  you  fare,  till  your  eyries  receive  you  at  the 
line 2913=>journey's end!" That is the polite thing to say among eagles. 
line 2914=>
line 2915=>####-"May  the  wind  under  your  wings  bear  you  where  the  sun  sails  and  the moon 
line 2916=>walks," answered Gandalf, who knew the correct reply.  
line 2917=>And so they parted. And though the lord of the eagles became in after days the 
line 2918=>King  of  All  Birds  and  wore  a  golden  crown,  and  his  fifteen  chieftains  golden 
line 2919=>collars  (made  of  the  gold  that  the  dwarves  gave  them),  Bilbo  never  saw  them 
line 2920=>again-except high and  far off  in  the battle of Five Armies. But as  that comes  in at 
line 2921=>the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now.  
line 2922=>There was a flat space on the top of the hill of stone and a well worn path with 
line 2923=>many steps leading down it to the river, across which a ford of huge flat stones led 
line 2924=>to  the  grass-land  beyond  the  stream.  There  was  a  little  cave  (a  wholesome  one 
line 2925=>with a pebbly floor) at the foot of the steps and near the end of the stony ford. Here 
line 2926=>the party gathered and discussed what was to be done. 
line 2927=>"I  always meant  to  see you  all  safe  (if possible) over  the mountains,"  said  the 
line 2928=>wizard,  "and  now  by  good management  and  good  luck  I  have  done  it.  Indeed we 
line 2929=>are  now  a  good  deal  further east than I ever meant to come with you, for after all 
line 2930=>this  is not my adventure.  I may  look  in on  it again before  it  is all over, but  in  the 
line 2931=>meanwhile I have some other pressing business to attend to." 
line 2932=>The  dwarves  groaned  and  looked  most  distressed,  and  Bilbo wept.  They  had 
line 2933=>begun to think Gandalf was going in come all the way and would always be there 
line 2934=>to  help  them  out  of  difficulties.  "I  am  not  going  to  disappear  this  very  instant," 
line 2935=>said  he.  "I  can  give  you  a  day  or  two more.  Probably  I  can  help  you  out of your 
line 2936=>present  plight,  and  I  need  a  little  help myself. We  have  no  food,  and  no  baggage, 
line 2937=>and no ponies to ride; and you don't know where you are. Now I can tell you that. 
line 2938=>You are still some miles north of the path which we should have been following, if 
line 2939=>we  had  not  left  the mountain  pass  in  a  hurry.  Very  few people  live  in  these parts, 
line 2940=>unless  they  have  come  here  since  I was  last  down  this way, which  is  some  years 
line 2941=>ago.  But  there  is  somebody  that  I  know  of,  who  lives  not  far  away.  That 
line 2942=>Somebody made the 
line 2943=>steps on the great rock-the Carrock I believe he calls it. He does not come here 
line 2944=>often,  certainly  not  in  the  daytime,  and  it  is  no  good  waiting  for  him.  In  fact  it 
line 2945=>would  be  very  dangerous. We  must  go  and  find  him;  and  if  all  goes  well  at  our 
line 2946=>meeting,  I  think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles  'farewell wherever you 
line 2947=>fare!' " 
line 2948=>They  begged  him  not  to  leave  them. They  offered  him  dragon-gold and silver 
line 2949=>and jewels, but he would not change his mind. 
line 2950=>"We  shall  see, we  shall  see!" he  said,  "and  I  think  I have earned already some 
line 2951=>of your dragon-gold - when you have got it." 
line 2952=>
line 2953=>####- 
line 2954=>After that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed in 
line 2955=>the river, which was shallow and clear and stony at the ford. When they had dried 
line 2956=>in the sun, which was now strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still sore and a 
line 2957=>little  hungry.  Soon  they  crossed  the  ford  (carrying  the  hobbit),  and  then  began  to 
line 2958=>march  through  the  long  green  grass  and  down  the  lines  of  the  wide-armed oaks 
line 2959=>and the tall elms. 
line 2960=>"And  why  is  it  called  the  Carrock?"  asked  Bilbo  as  he  went  along  at  the 
line 2961=>wizard's side. 
line 2962=>"He  called  it  the  Carrock,  because  carrock  is  his  word  for  it.  He  calls  things 
line 2963=>like  that  carrocks,  and  this  one  is  the Carrock  because  it  is  the  only  one  near  his 
line 2964=>home and he knows it well." 
line 2965=>"Who calls it? Who knows it?" 
line 2966=>"The  Somebody  I  spoke  of-a  very  great  person.  You  must  all  be  very  polite 
line 2967=>when  I  introduce  you.  I  shall  introduce  you  slowly,  two  by  two,  I  think;  and  you 
line 2968=>must  be  careful  not  to  annoy  him,  or  heaven  knows what will  happen. He can be 
line 2969=>appalling  when  he  is  angry,  though  he  is  kind  enough  if  humoured.  Still  I  warn 
line 2970=>you he gets angry easily." 
line 2971=>The dwarves all gathered round when they heard the wizard talking like this to 
line 2972=>Bilbo.  "Is  that  the  person  you  are  taking  us  to  now?"  they  asked.  "Couldn't  you 
line 2973=>find someone more easy-tempered? Hadn't you better explain it all a bit clearer?"-
line 2974=>and so on. 
line 2975=>"Yes  it  certainly  is!  No  I  could  not!  And  I  was  explaining  very  carefully," 
line 2976=>answered  the  wizard  crossly.  "If  you  must  know  more,  his  name  is  Beorn. He  is 
line 2977=>very strong, and he is a skin-changer." 
line 2978=>"What!  a  furrier,  a  man  that  calls  rabbits  conies,  when  he  doesn't  turn  their 
line 2979=>skins into squirrels?" asked Bilbo. 
line 2980=>"Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!" said Gandalf. "Don't be a fool Mr. 
line 2981=>Baggins  if you  can help  it; and  in  the name of all wonder don't mention  the word 
line 2982=>furrier  again  as  long  as  you  are  within  a  hundred  miles  of  his  house,  nor,  rug, 
line 2983=>cape,  tippet, muff, nor any other such unfortunate word! He  is a skin-changer. He 
line 2984=>changes  his  skin;  sometimes  he  is  a  huge  black  bear,  sometimes  he  is  a  great 
line 2985=>strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. I cannot tell you much 
line 2986=>more,  though  that ought  to be enough. Some say  that he  is a bear descended from 
line 2987=>the  great  and  ancient  bears  of  the  mountains  that  lived  there  before  the  giants 
line 2988=>came. Others  say  that he  is  a man descended  from  the  first men who  lived before 
line 2989=>Smaug  or  the  other  dragons  came  into  this  part  of  the  world,  and  before  the 
line 2990=>
line 2991=>####-goblins came into the hills out of the North. I cannot say, though I fancy the last is 
line 2992=>the true tale. He is not the sort of person to ask questions of. 
line 2993=>"At any rate he is under no enchantment but his own. He lives in an oak-wood 
line 2994=>and has a great wooden house; and as a man he keeps cattle and horses which are 
line 2995=>nearly  is marvellous  as himself. They work  for him  and  talk  to him. He does not 
line 2996=>eat  them;  neither  does  he  hunt  or  eat  wild  animals.  He  keeps  hives  and  hives  of 
line 2997=>great fierce bees, and  lives most on cream and honey. As a bear he ranges far and 
line 2998=>wide.  I  once  saw  him  sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock at night watching 
line 2999=>the  moon  sinking  towards  the  Misty  Mountains,  and  I  heard  him  growl  in  the 
line 3000=>tongue  of  bears;  'The  day  will  come  when  they  will  perish  and  I  shall  go  back!' 
line 3001=>That is why I believe he once came from the mountains himself." 
line 3002=> 
line 3003=>Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more 
line 3004=>questions. They still had a long way to walk before them. Up slope and down dale 
line 3005=>they  plodded.  It  grew  very  hot.  Sometimes  they  rested  under  the  trees,  and  then 
line 3006=>Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough 
line 3007=>yet to have fallen to the ground. 
line 3008=>It  was  the  middle  of  the  afternoon  before  they  noticed  that  great  patches  of 
line 3009=>flowers had begun to spring up, all the same kinds growing together as if they had 
line 3010=>been  planted.  Especially  there  was  clover,  waving  patches  of  cockscomb  clover, 
line 3011=>and  purple  clover,  and wide  stretches  of  short white  sweet  honey-smelling clover. 
line 3012=>There  was  a  buzzing  and  a  whirring  and  a  droning  in  the  air.  Bees  were  busy 
line 3013=>everywhere. And such bees! Bilbo had never seen anything like them. 
line 3014=>"If one was to sting me," he thought, "I should swell up as big again as I am!" 
line 3015=>They  were  bigger  than  hornets.  The  drones  were  bigger  than  your  thumb,  a 
line 3016=>good  deal,  and  the  bands  of  yellow  on  their  deep  black  bodies  shone  like  fiery 
line 3017=>gold. 
line 3018=>"We are getting near," said Gandalf. "We are on the edge of his bee-pastures." 
line 3019=>After  a  while  they  came  to  a  belt  of  tall  and  very  ancient  oaks,  and  beyond 
line 3020=>these to a high thorn-hedge through which you could neither see nor scramble. 
line 3021=>"You had better wait here," said the wizard to the dwarves; "and when I call or 
line 3022=>whistle  begin  to  come  after  me —  you  will  see  the  way  I  go-but  only  in  pairs, 
line 3023=>mind, about  five minutes between each pair of you. Bombur  is  fattest  and will do 
line 3024=>for two, he had better come alone and last. Come on Mr. Baggins! There is a gate 
line 3025=>somewhere round this way." And with that he went off along the hedge taking the 
line 3026=>frightened hobbit with him. 
line 3027=>
line 3028=>####-They  soon  came  to  a wooden  gate,  high  and  broad,  beyond which  they could 
line 3029=>see  gardens  and  a  cluster  of  low  wooden  buildings,  some  thatched  and  made  of 
line 3030=>unshaped logs; barns, stables, sheds, and a long low wooden house. 
line 3031=>Inside  on  the  southward  side  of  the  great  hedge were  rows  and  rows  of  hives 
line 3032=>with  bell-shaped  tops made of  straw. The noise of  the giant bees  flying  to and  fro 
line 3033=>and crawling in and out filled all the air.  
line 3034=>The  wizard  and  the  hobbit  pushed  open  the  heavy  creaking  gate  and  went 
line 3035=>down a wide track towards the house. Some horses, very sleek and well-groomed, 
line 3036=>trotted up across  the grass and  looked at  them  intently with very  intelligent  faces; 
line 3037=>then off they galloped to the buildings. 
line 3038=>"They have gone to tell him of the arrival of strangers," said Gandalf. 
line 3039=>Soon  they  reached  a  courtyard,  three  walls  of  which  were  formed  by  the 
line 3040=>wooden  house  and  its  two  long wings.  In  the middle  there was  lying  a  great  oak-
line 3041=>trunk with many  lopped branches beside  it. Standing near was a huge man with a 
line 3042=>thick black beard and' hair, and great bare arms and legs with knotted muscles. He 
line 3043=>was clothed in a tunic of wool down to his knees, and was leaning on a large axe. 
line 3044=>The horses were standing by him with their noses at his shoulder.  
line 3045=>"Ugh!  here  they  are!"  he  said  to  the  horses.  "They  don't  look  dangerous. You 
line 3046=>can be off!" He laughed a great rolling laugh, put down his axe and came forward. 
line 3047=>"Who  are  you  and what  do  you want?"  he  asked  gruffly,  standing  in  front  of 
line 3048=>them and towering tall above Gandalf. 
line 3049=>As for Bilbo he could easily have  trotted  through his  legs without ducking his 
line 3050=>head to miss the fringe of the man's brown tunic. 
line 3051=>"I am Gandalf," said the wizard. 
line 3052=>"Never  heard  of  him,"  growled  the  man,  "And  what's  this  little  fellow?"  he 
line 3053=>said, stooping down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy eyebrows. 
line 3054=>"That is Mr. Baggins, a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable reputation," 
line 3055=>said Gandalf. Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take off, and was painfully conscious 
line 3056=>of his many missing buttons. "I am a wizard," continued Gandalf. "I have heard of 
line 3057=>you,  if you have not heard of me; but perhaps you have heard of my good cousin 
line 3058=>Radagast who lives near the Southern borders of Mirkwood?" 
line 3059=>"Yes;  not  a  bad  fellow  as  wizards  go,  I  believe.  I  used  to  see  him  now  and 
line 3060=>again,"  said  Beorn.  "Well,  now  I  know  who  you  are,  or  who  you  say  you  are. 
line 3061=>What do you want?" 
line 3062=>"To  tell  you  the  truth, we  have  lost  our  luggage  and  nearly  lost  our way,  and 
line 3063=>are  rather  in need of help, or  at  least  advice.  I may  say we have had  rather  a bad 
line 3064=>time with goblins in the mountains." 
line 3065=>
line 3066=>####-"Goblins?" said the big man less gruffly. "O ho, so you've been  having trouble 
line 3067=>with them have you? What did you go near them for?" 
line 3068=>"We  did  not  mean  to.  They  surprised  us  at  night  in  a  pass  which  we  had  to 
line 3069=>cross, we were coming out of the Lands over West into these countries-it is a long 
line 3070=>tale." 
line 3071=>"Then  you  had  better  come  inside  and  tell  me  some  of  it,  if  it  won't  take  all 
line 3072=>day,"  said  the  man  leading  the  way  through  a  dark  door  that  opened  out  of  the 
line 3073=>courtyard into the house. 
line 3074=>Following  him  they  found  themselves  in  a  wide  hall  with  a  fire-place  in  the 
line 3075=>middle. Though  it was summer there was a wood-fire burning and the smoke was 
line 3076=>rising  to  the blackened  rafters  in  search of  the way out  through  an opening  in  the 
line 3077=>roof. They passed  through  this dim hall,  lit only by  the  fire and  the hole above  it, 
line 3078=>and came  through another smaller door into a sort of veranda propped on wooden 
line 3079=>posts made  of  single  tree-trunks. It faced south and was still warm and filled with 
line 3080=>the  light  of  the westering  sun which  slanted  into  it,  and  fell  golden  on  the  garden 
line 3081=>full of flowers that came right up to the steps. 
line 3082=>Here  they  sat  on  wooden  benches  while  Gandalf  began  his  tale,  and  Bilbo 
line 3083=>swung his dangling  legs and  looked at  the  flowers  in  the garden, wondering what 
line 3084=>their names could be, as he had never seen half of them before. 
line 3085=>"I was coming over the mountains with a friend or two…" said the wizard. 
line 3086=>"Or two? I can only see one, and a little one at that," said Beorn. 
line 3087=>"Well  to  tell you  the  truth,  I did not  like  to bother you with a  lot of us, until  I 
line 3088=>found out if you were busy. I will give a call, if I may." 
line 3089=>"Go on, call away!" 
line 3090=>So  Gandalf  gave  a  long  shrill  whistle,  and  presently  Thorin  and  Dori  came 
line 3091=>round the house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them. 
line 3092=>"One or three you meant, I see!" said Beorn. "But these aren't hobbits, they are 
line 3093=>dwarves!" 
line 3094=>"Thorin  Oakenshield,  at  your  service!  Dori  at  your  service!"  said  the  two 
line 3095=>dwarves bowing again. 
line 3096=>"I  don't  need  your  service,  thank  you,"  said  Beorn,  "but  I  expect  you  need 
line 3097=>mine.  I  am  not  over  fond  of  dwarves;  but  if  it  is  true  you  are  Thorin  (son  of 
line 3098=>Thrain, son of  Thror,  I believe), and  that your companion  is  respectable, and  that 
line 3099=>you  are  enemies  of  goblins  and  are  not  up  to  any  mischief  in  my  lands-what are 
line 3100=>you up to, by the way?" 
line 3101=>"They  are  on  their  way  to  visit  the  land  of  their  fathers,  away  east  beyond 
line 3102=>Mirkwood,"  put  in  Gandalf,  "and  it  is  entirely  an  accident  that  we  are  in  your 
line 3103=>
line 3104=>####-lands at all. We were crossing by the High Pass that should have brought us to the 
line 3105=>road  that  lies  to  the  south  of  your  country,  when  we  were  attacked  by  the  evil 
line 3106=>goblins-as I was about to tell you." 
line 3107=>"Go on telling, then!" said Beorn, who was never very polite. 
line 3108=>"There was a terrible storm; the stone-giants were out hurling rocks, and at the 
line 3109=>head  of  the  pass  we  took  refuge  in  a  cave,  the  hob  bit  and  I  and  several  of  our 
line 3110=>companions…" 
line 3111=>"Do you call two several?" 
line 3112=>"Well, no. As a matter of fact there were more than two." 
line 3113=>"Where are they? Killed, eaten, gone home?" 
line 3114=>"Well,  no.  They  don't  seem  all  to  have  come  when  I  whistled.  Shy,  I  expect. 
line 3115=>You see, we are very much afraid that we are rather a lot for you to entertain." 
line 3116=>"Go on, whistle again! I am in for a party, it seems, and one or two more won't 
line 3117=>make much difference," growled Beorn. 
line 3118=>Gandalf  whistled  again;  but  Nori  and  Ori  were  there  almost  before  he  had 
line 3119=>stopped,  for,  if  you  remember, Gandalf  had  told  them  to  come  in pairs  every  five 
line 3120=>minutes. 
line 3121=>"Hullo!"  said  Beorn.  "You  came  pretty  quick-where were  you  hiding? Come 
line 3122=>on my jack-in-the-boxes!" 
line 3123=>"Nori at your service, Ori at . . ." they began; but Beorn interrupted them. 
line 3124=>"Thank you! When I want your help I will ask for it. Sit down, and let's get on 
line 3125=>with this tale, or it will be supper-time before it is ended." 
line 3126=>"As soon as we were asleep," went on Gandalf, "a crack at the back of the cave 
line 3127=>opened;  goblins  came  out  and  grabbed  the  hobbit  and  the  dwarves  and our  troop 
line 3128=>of ponies—" 
line 3129=>"Troop  of  ponies?  What  were  you-a  travelling  circus? Or were  you  carrying 
line 3130=>lots of goods? Or do you always call six a troop?" 
line 3131=>"O  no!  As  a  matter  of  fact  there  were  more  than  six  ponies,  for  there  were 
line 3132=>more  than  six  of  us-and well,  here  are  two more!"  Just  at  that moment Balin  and 
line 3133=>Dwalin appeared and bowed so low that their beards swept the stone floor. The big 
line 3134=>man was frowning at first, but  they did  their very best  to be frightfully polite, and 
line 3135=>kept  on  nodding  and  bending  and  bowing  and  waving  their  hoods  before  their 
line 3136=>knees  (in  proper  dwarf-fashion),  till  he  stopped  frowning  and  burst  into  a 
line 3137=>chuckling laugh; they looked so comical. 
line 3138=>"Troop, was  right,"  he  said.  "A  fine  comic  one.  Come  in my merry men,  and 
line 3139=>what  are  your  names?  I  don't  want  your  service  just  now,  only  your  names;  and 
line 3140=>then sit down and stop wagging!" 
line 3141=>
line 3142=>####-"Balin  and  Dwalin,"  they  said  not  daring  to  be  offended,  and  sat  flop  on  the 
line 3143=>floor looking rather surprised. 
line 3144=>"Now go on again!" said Beorn to the wizard. 
line 3145=>"Where  was  1?  O  yes—  I  was  not  grabbed.  I  killed  a  goblin  or  two  with  a 
line 3146=>flash—" 
line 3147=>"Good!" growled Beorn. "It is some good being a wizard, then." 
line 3148=>"—and slipped inside the crack before it closed. I followed down into the main 
line 3149=>hall, which was  crowded with  goblins. The Great Goblin was  there with  thirty or 
line 3150=>forty armed guards. I thought to myself 'even if they were not all chained together, 
line 3151=>what can a dozen do against so many?' " 
line 3152=>"A  dozen!  That's  the  first  time  I've  heard  eight  called  a  dozen.  Or  have  you 
line 3153=>still got some more jacks that haven't yet come out of their boxes?" 
line 3154=>"Well, yes, there seem to be a couple more here now – Fili and Kili, I believe," 
line 3155=>said Gandalf, as these two now appeared and stood smiling and bowing. 
line 3156=>"That's enough!" said Beorn. "Sit down and be quiet! Now go on, Gandalf!" 
line 3157=>So  Gandalf  went  on  with  the  tale,  until  he  came  to  the  fight  in  the  dark,  the 
line 3158=>discovery  of  the  lower  gate,  and  their  horror  when  they  found  that  Mr.  Baggins 
line 3159=>had been mislaid. 
line 3160=>"We  counted  ourselves  and  found  that  there  was  no  hobbit.  There  were  only 
line 3161=>fourteen of us left!" 
line 3162=>"Fourteen!  That's  the  first  time  I've  heard  one  from  ten  leave  fourteen.  You 
line 3163=>mean nine, or else you haven't told me yet all the names of your party." 
line 3164=>"Well, of course you haven't seen Oin and Gloin yet. And, bless me! here they 
line 3165=>are. I hope you will forgive them for bothering you." 
line 3166=>"O  let  'em all come! Hurry up! Come along, you  two, and sit down! But  look 
line 3167=>here, Gandalf, even now we have only got yourself and ten dwarves and the hobbit 
line 3168=>that was  lost. That  only makes  eleven  (plus  one mislaid) and not fourteen, unless 
line 3169=>wizards  count  differently  to  other  people.  But  now  please  get  on  with  the  tale." 
line 3170=>Beorn did not show it more than he could help, but really he had begun to get very 
line 3171=>interested. You  see,  in  the  old  days  he  had  known  the  very  part of  the mountains 
line 3172=>that  Gandalf  was  describing.  He  nodded  and  he  growled,  when  he  heard  of  the 
line 3173=>hobbit's  reappearance  and  of  their  scramble  down  the  stone-slide  and  of  the wolf-
line 3174=>ring m the woods. When Gandalf came to their climbing into trees with the wolves 
line 3175=>all underneath, he got up and strode about and muttered: 
line 3176=>"I wish I had been there! I would have given them more than fireworks!" 
line 3177=>"Well,"  said  Gandalf  very  glad  to  see  that  his  tale  was  making  a  good 
line 3178=>impression,  "I  did  the  best  I  could.  There  we  were  with  the  wolves  going  mad 
line 3179=>
line 3180=>####-underneath us  and  the  forest beginning  to blaze  in places, when  the goblins  came 
line 3181=>down  from  the  hills  and  discovered  us.  They  yelled  with  delight  and  sang  songs 
line 3182=>making fun of us. Fifteen birds in five fir-trees…" 
line 3183=>"Good heavens!" growled Beorn. "Don't pretend that goblins can't count. They 
line 3184=>can. Twelve isn't fifteen and they know it." 
line 3185=>"And  so  do  1.  There  were  Bifur  and  Bofur  as  well.  I  haven't  ventured  to 
line 3186=>introduce them before, but here they are." 
line 3187=>In  came  Bifur  and  Bofur.  "And  me!"  gasped  Bombur  pulling  up  behind.  He 
line 3188=>was  fat, and also angry at being  left  till  last. He  refused  to wait  five minutes, and 
line 3189=>followed immediately after the other two. 
line 3190=>"Well, now there are fifteen of you; and since goblins can count, I suppose that 
line 3191=>is  all  that  there  were  up  the  trees.  Now  perhaps  we  can  finish  this  story  without 
line 3192=>any more interruptions." Mr. Baggins saw then how clever Gandalf had been. The 
line 3193=>interruptions had really made Beorn more interested in the story, and the story had 
line 3194=>kept  him  from  sending  the  dwarves off  at once  like  suspicious beggars. He never 
line 3195=>invited people into his house, if he could help it. He had very few friends and they 
line 3196=>lived  a  good  way  away;  and  he  never  invited  more  than  a  couple  of  these  to  his 
line 3197=>house at a time. Now he had got fifteen strangers sitting in his porch! 
line 3198=>By  the  time  the wizard had  finished his  tale  and had  told of  the  eagles'  rescue 
line 3199=>and of how they had all been brought to the Carrock, the sun had fallen behind the 
line 3200=>peaks of the Misty Mountains and the shadows were long in Beorn's garden. 
line 3201=>"A  very  good  tale!"  said  he.  "The  best  I  have  heard  for  a  long  while.  If  all 
line 3202=>beggars  could  tell  such  a  good  one,  they  might  find  me  kinder.  You  may  be 
line 3203=>making  it  all  up,  of  course,  but  you  deserve  a  supper  for  the  story  all  the  same. 
line 3204=>Let's have something to eat!" 
line 3205=>"Yes, please!" they all said together. "Thank you very much!" 
line 3206=>Inside  the  hall  it was  now  quite  dark. Beorn  clapped  his  hands,  and  in  trotted 
line 3207=>four  beautiful  white  ponies  and  several  large  long-bodied  grey  dogs.  Beorn  said 
line 3208=>something  to  them  in  a  queer  language  like  animal  noises  turned  into  talk.  They 
line 3209=>went  out  again  and  soon  came  back  carrying  torches  in  their mouths, which  they 
line 3210=>lit  at  the  fire  and  stuck  in  low brackets on  the pillars of  the hall  about  the  central 
line 3211=>hearth. 
line 3212=>The  dogs  could  stand  on  their  hind-legs  when  they  wished,  and  carry  things 
line 3213=>with  their  fore-feet.  Quickly  they  got  out  boards  and  trestles  from  the  side  walls 
line 3214=>and set them up near the fire. 
line 3215=>Then  baa-baa-baa!  was  heard,  and  in  came  some  snow-white  sheep  led  by  a 
line 3216=>large  coal-black  ram.  One  bore  a  white  cloth  embroidered  at  the  edges  with 
line 3217=>
line 3218=>####-figures of animals; others bore on  their broad backs  trays with bowls and platters 
line 3219=>and knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on the trestle 
line 3220=>tables.  These  were  very  low,   low  enough  even  for  Bilbo  to  sit  at  comfortably. 
line 3221=>Beside  them  a  pony  pushed  two  low-seated  benches  with  wide  rush-bottoms and 
line 3222=>little  short  thick  legs  for Gandalf  and Thorin, while  at  the  far  end  he  put Beorn's 
line 3223=>big  black  chair  of  the  same  sort  (in which  he  sat with his great  legs  stuck  far out 
line 3224=>under the table). These were all the chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had 
line 3225=>them  low  like  the  tables for  the convenience of  the wonderful animals  that waited 
line 3226=>on him. What did  the  rest sit on? They were not  forgotten. The other ponies came 
line 3227=>in  rolling  round  drum-shaped  sections  of  logs,  smoothed  and  polished,  and  low 
line 3228=>enough  even  for Bilbo;  so  soon  they were  all  seated  at Beorn's  table,  and  the hall 
line 3229=>had not seen such a gathering for many a year.  
line 3230=>There  they  had  a  supper, or  a dinner,  such  as  they had not had  since  they  left 
line 3231=>the Last Homely House  in  the West and  said good-bye to Elrond. The light of the 
line 3232=>torches  and  the  fire  flickered  about  them,  and  on  the  table  were  two  tall  red 
line 3233=>beeswax candles. All the time they ate, Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of 
line 3234=>the  wild  lands  on  this  side  of  the  mountains,  and  especially  of  the  dark  and 
line 3235=>dangerous wood,  that  lay  outstretched  far  to North  and  South  a  day's  ride  before 
line 3236=>them, barring their way to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood. 
line 3237=>The  dwarves  listened  and  shook  their  beards,  for  they  knew  that  they  must 
line 3238=>soon  venture  into  that  forest  and  that  after  the mountains  it  was  the  worst  of  the 
line 3239=>perils  they  had  to  pass  before  they  came  to  the  dragon's  stronghold. When  dinner 
line 3240=>was  over  they  began  to  tell  tales  of  their  own,  but  Beorn  seemed  to  be  growing 
line 3241=>drowsy  and  paid  little  heed  to  them.  They  spoke  most  of  gold  and  silver  and 
line 3242=>jewels  and  the making  of  things  by  smith-craft,  and Beorn did not  appear  to  care 
line 3243=>for  such  things:  there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, and few save the 
line 3244=>knives were made of metal at all. 
line 3245=>They  sat  long  at  the  table with  their wooden  drinking-bowls filled with mead. 
line 3246=>The dark night came on outside. The fires in the middle of the hall were built with 
line 3247=>fresh logs and the torches were put out, and still they sat in the light of the dancing 
line 3248=>flames with  the pillars of  the house standing  tall behind  them, arid dark at  the  top 
line 3249=>like  trees  of  the  forest.  Whether  it  was  magic  or  not,  it  seemed  to  Bilbo  that he 
line 3250=>heard  a  sound  like  wind  in  the  branches  stirring  in  the  rafters,  and  the  hoot  of 
line 3251=>owls.  Soon  he  began  to  nod  with  sleep  and  the  voices  seemed  to  grow  far  away, 
line 3252=>until he woke with a start. 
line 3253=>The great door had creaked and slammed. Beorn was gone. The dwarves were 
line 3254=>sitting  cross-legged  on  the  floor  round  the  fire,  and  presently  they  began  to  sing. 
line 3255=>
line 3256=>####-Some  of  the  verses  were  like  this,  but  there  were  many  more,  and  their  singing 
line 3257=>went on for a long while: 
line 3258=> 
line 3259=>
line 3260=>####-The wind was on the withered heath, 
line 3261=>but in the forest stirred no leaf: 
line 3262=>there shadows lay by night and day,  
line 3263=>and dark things silent crept beneath. 
line 3264=>The wind came down from mountains cold, 
line 3265=>and like a tide it roared and rolled; 
line 3266=>the branches groaned, the forest moaned, 
line 3267=>and leaves were laid upon the mould. 
line 3268=> 
line 3269=>The wind went on from West to East ;  
line 3270=>all movement in the forest ceased, 
line 3271=>but shrill and harsh across the marsh  
line 3272=>its whistling voices were released. 
line 3273=> 
line 3274=>The grasses hissed, their tassels bent, 
line 3275=>the reeds were rattling-on it went 
line 3276=>o' er shaken pool under heavens cool 
line 3277=>where racing clouds were torn and rent. 
line 3278=> 
line 3279=>It passed the lonely Mountain bare  
line 3280=>and swept above the dragon's lair :  
line 3281=>there black and dark lay boulders stark 
line 3282=>and flying smoke was in the air.  
line 3283=> 
line 3284=>It left the world and took its flight 
line 3285=>over the wide seas of the night. 
line 3286=>The moon set sail upon the gale, 
line 3287=>and stars were fanned to leaping light. 
line 3288=>
line 3289=> 
line 3290=>Bilbo  began  to  nod  again.  Suddenly  up  stood  Gandalf.  "It  is  time  for  us  to 
line 3291=>sleep,"  be  said,  "—for us, but not I think for Beorn. In this hall we can rest sound 
line 3292=>and  safe,  but  I  warn  you  all  not  to  forget what  Beorn  said  before  he  left  us:  you 
line 3293=>must not stray outside until the sun is up, on your peril." 
line 3294=>Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of 
line 3295=>raised  platform  between  the  pillars  and  the  outer  wall.  For  him  there was  a  little 
line 3296=>mattress  of  straw  and  woollen  blankets.  He  snuggled  into  them  very  gladly, 
line 3297=>summertime though it was. The fire burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in the night 
line 3298=>he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf were all 
line 3299=>asleep,  to  judge  by  their  breathing;  a  splash  of  white  on  the  floor  came  from  the 
line 3300=>high moon, which was peering down through the smoke-hole in the roof. 
line 3301=>
line 3302=>####-There  was  a  growling  sound  outside,  and  a  noise  as  of  some  great  animal 
line 3303=>scuffling  at  the  door. Bilbo .wondered what it was, and whether it could be Beorn 
line 3304=>in enchanted shape, and if he would come in as a bear and kill them. 
line 3305=>He  dived  under  the  blankets  and  hid  his  head,  and  fell  asleep  again  at  last  in 
line 3306=>spite of his fears. 
line 3307=>It was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in 
line 3308=>the shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on 
line 3309=>to  the  floor.  It was Bofur,  and he was grumbling  about  it, when Bilbo opened his 
line 3310=>eyes. 
line 3311=>"Get up lazybones," he said, "or there will be no breakfast left for you." 
line 3312=>Up jumped Bilbo. "Breakfast!" he cried. "Where is breakfast?" 
line 3313=>"Mostly  inside us,"  answered  the other dwarves who were moving  around  the 
line 3314=>hall; "but what is left is out on the veranda. We have been about looking for Beorn 
line 3315=>ever  since  the  sun got up; but  there  is no  sign of him anywhere,  though we  found 
line 3316=>breakfast laid as soon as we went out." 
line 3317=>"Where is Gandalf?" asked Bilbo, moving off to find something to eat as quick 
line 3318=>as he could. 
line 3319=>"O!  out  and  about  somewhere,"  they  told  him.  But  he  saw  no  sign  of  the 
line 3320=>wizard  all  that  day  until  the  evening.  Just  before  sunset  he  walked  into  the  hall, 
line 3321=>where  the  hobbit  and  the  dwarves  were  having  supper,  waited  on  by  Beorn's 
line 3322=>wonderful  animals,  as  they  had  been  all  day.  Of  Beorn  they  had  seen  and  heard 
line 3323=>nothing since the night before, and they were getting puzzled. 
line 3324=>"Where is our host, and where have you been all day yourself?" they all cried. 
line 3325=>"One  question  at  a  time-and  none  till  after  supper!  I  haven't  had  a  bite  since 
line 3326=>breakfast." 
line 3327=>At  last  Gandalf  pushed  away  his  plate  and  jug  —  he  had  eaten  two  whole 
line 3328=>loaves  (with masses  of  butter  and  honey  and  clotted  cream)  and  drunk  at  least  a 
line 3329=>quart  of mead  and  he  took  out  his  pipe.  "I will  answer  the  second  question  first," 
line 3330=>he said, "-but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke rings!" Indeed for a long 
line 3331=>time they could get nothing more out of him, he was so busy sending smoke-rings 
line 3332=>dodging  round  the  pillars  of  the  hall,  changing  them  into  all  sorts  of  different 
line 3333=>shapes and colours, and setting  them at  last chasing one another out of the hole in 
line 3334=>the roof. 
line 3335=>They must have  looked very queer  from outside, popping out  into  the  air one 
line 3336=>after another, green, blue, red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little ones; little 
line 3337=>ones dodging  through big ones  and  joining  into  figure-eights, and going off like a 
line 3338=>flock of birds into the distance. 
line 3339=>
line 3340=>####-"I have been picking out bear-tracks," he said at last. "There must have been a 
line 3341=>regular  bears'  meeting  outside  here  last  night.  I  soon  saw  that  Beorn  could  not 
line 3342=>have  made  them  all:  there  were  far  too many  of  them,  and  they  were  of  various 
line 3343=>sizes  too.  I  should  say  there  were  little  bears,  large  bears,  ordinary  bears,  and 
line 3344=>gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn. They came from 
line 3345=>almost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the Mountains. In 
line 3346=>that  direction  only  one  set  of  footprints  led-none  coming,  only  ones  going  away 
line 3347=>from here. 
line 3348=>I  followed  these  as  far  as  the  Carrock.  There  they  disappeared  into  the  river, 
line 3349=>but  the water was  too  deep  and  strong  beyond  the  rock  for me  to  cross.  It  is  easy 
line 3350=>enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the ford, but on 
line 3351=>the  other  side  is  a  cliff  standing  up  from  a  swirling  channel.  I  had  to  walk miles 
line 3352=>before  I  found  a  place  where  the  river  was  wide  and  shallow  enough  for  me  to 
line 3353=>wade  and  swim,  and  then  miles  back  again  to  pick  up  the  tracks  again.  By  that 
line 3354=>time  it  was  too  late  for  me  to  follow  them  far.  They  went  straight  off  in  the 
line 3355=>direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we had 
line 3356=>our  pleasant  little  party  with  the  Wargs  the  night  before  last.  And  now  I  think  I 
line 3357=>have  answered  your  first  question,  too,"  ended  Gandalf,  and  he  sat  a  long  while 
line 3358=>silent. 
line 3359=>Bilbo  thought  he  knew what  the wizard meant.  "What  shall we  do,"  he  cried, 
line 3360=>"if  he  leads  all  the Wargs  and  the  goblins  down  here? We  shall  all  be  caught  and 
line 3361=>killed! I thought you said he was not 9 friend of theirs." 
line 3362=>"So I did. And don't be silly! You had better go to bed, your wits are sleepy." 
line 3363=>The hobbit felt quite crushed, and as there seemed nothing else to do he did go 
line 3364=>to  bed;  and  while  the  dwarves  were  still  singing  songs  he  dropped  asleep,  still 
line 3365=>puzzling his little head about Beorn, till he dreamed a dream of hundreds of black 
line 3366=>bears  dancing  slow  heavy  dances  round  and  round  in  the  moonlight  in  the 
line 3367=>courtyard.  Then  he  woke  up  when  everyone  else  was  asleep,  and  he  heard  the 
line 3368=>same  scraping,  scuffling,  snuffling,  and  growling  as  before.  Next  morning  they 
line 3369=>were all wakened by Beorn himself. 
line 3370=>"So here you all are still!" he said. He picked up the hobbit and laughed: "Not 
line 3371=>eaten  up  by  Wargs  or  goblins  or  wicked  bears  yet  I  see";  and  he  poked  Mr. 
line 3372=>Baggins' waistcoat most disrespectfully. "Little bunny is getting nice and fat again 
line 3373=>on bread and honey," he chuckled. "Come and have some more!" 
line 3374=> 
line 3375=>So  they  all  went  to  breakfast  with  him.  Beorn  was  most  jolly  for  a  change; 
line 3376=>indeed  he  seemed  to  be  in  a  splendidly  good  humour  and  set  them  all  laughing 
line 3377=>
line 3378=>####-with his funny stories; nor did they have to wonder long where he had been or why 
line 3379=>he  was  so  nice  to  them,  for he  told  them himself. He had been over  the  river  and 
line 3380=>right  back  up  into  the  mountains-from  which  you  can  guess  that  he  could  travel 
line 3381=>quickly,  in bear's  shape  at  any  rate. From  the burnt wolf-glade he had soon found 
line 3382=>out  that  part  of  their  story  was  true;  but  he  had  found  more  than  that:  he  had 
line 3383=>caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the woods. From these he had got news: 
line 3384=>the  goblin  patrols  were  still  hunting  with  Wargs  for  the  dwarves,  and  they  were 
line 3385=>fiercely  angry  because  of  the  death  of  the  Great  Goblin,  and  also  because  of  the 
line 3386=>burning of the chief wolf's nose and the death from the wizard's fire of many of his 
line 3387=>chief  servants. So much  they  told him when he  forced  them, but he guessed  there 
line 3388=>was  more  wickedness  than  this  afoot,  and  that  a  great  raid  of  the  whole  goblin 
line 3389=>army with  their wolf-allies  into  the  lands  shadowed by  the mountains might  soon 
line 3390=>be made  to  find  the  dwarves,  or  to  take  vengeance  on  the men  and  creatures  that 
line 3391=>lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering them. 
line 3392=>"It was  a  good  story,  that of yours," said Beorn, "but I like it still better now I 
line 3393=>am sure it is true. You must forgive my not taking your word. If you lived near the 
line 3394=>edge of Mirkwood, you would  take  the word of no one  that you did not know  as 
line 3395=>well  as  your  brother  or  better. As  it is, I can only say that I have hurried home as 
line 3396=>fast  as  I  could  to  see  that  you  were  safe,  and  to  offer  you  any  help  that  I  can.  I 
line 3397=>shall  think more  kindly  of  dwarves  after  this. Killed  the Great Goblin,  killed  the 
line 3398=>Great Goblin!" he chuckled fiercely to himself. 
line 3399=>"What did you do with the goblin and the Warg?" asked Bilbo suddenly.  
line 3400=>"Come  and  see!"  said  Beorn,  and  they  followed  round  the  house.  A  goblin's 
line 3401=>head was  stuck  outside  the  gate  and  a warg-skin was nailed to a tree just beyond. 
line 3402=>Beorn  was  a  fierce  enemy.  But  now  he  was  their  friend,  and  Gandalf  thought  it 
line 3403=>wise  to  tell  him  their  whole  story  and  the  reason  of  their  journey,  so  that  they 
line 3404=>could get the most help he could offer.  
line 3405=>This is what he promised to do for them. He would provide ponies for each of 
line 3406=>them,  and  a  horse  for Gandalf,  for  their  journey  to  the  forest,  and  he would  lade 
line 3407=>them with food to last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as easy as 
line 3408=>possible to carry-nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of 
line 3409=>honey,  and twice-baked cakes that would keep good a long time, and on a little of 
line 3410=>which they could march far. The making of these was one of his secrets; but honey 
line 3411=>was in them, as in most of his foods, and they were good to eat, though they made 
line 3412=>one  thirsty. Water, he said, they would not need to carry this side of the forest, for 
line 3413=>there were streams and springs along  the road. "But your way  through Mirkwood 
line 3414=>is  dark,  dangerous  and  difficult,"  he  said.  "Water  is  not  easy  to  find  there,  nor 
line 3415=>
line 3416=>####-food.  The  time  is  not  yet  come  for  nuts  (though  it may  be  past  and  gone  indeed 
line 3417=>before  you  get  to  the  other  side),  and  nuts  are  about  all  that  grows  there  fit  for 
line 3418=>food;  in  there  the wild  things are dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with 
line 3419=>skins  for  carrying water,  and  I will give you  some bows  and  arrows. But  I doubt 
line 3420=>very much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be wholesome to eat or to 
line 3421=>drink. There is one stream there, I know, black and strong which crosses the path. 
line 3422=>That  you  should  neither  drink  of,  nor  bathe  in;  for  I  have  heard  that  it  carries 
line 3423=>enchantment and a great drowsiness and forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of 
line 3424=>that  place  I  don't  think  you  will  shoot  anything,  wholesome  or  unwholesome, 
line 3425=>without straying from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any reason. "That is 
line 3426=>all  the  advice  I  can  give  you.  Beyond  the  edge  of  the  forest  I  cannot  help  you 
line 3427=>much;  you must  depend  on  your  luck  and  your  courage  and  the  food  I  send with 
line 3428=>you. At the gate of the forest I must ask you to send back my horse and my ponies. 
line 3429=>But I wish you all speed, and my house is open to you, if ever you come back this 
line 3430=>way again." 
line 3431=>They  thanked  him,  of  course,  with  many  bows  and  sweepings  of  their  hoods 
line 3432=>and with many an "at your service, O master of the wide wooden halls!" But their 
line 3433=>spirits  sank  at  his  grave  words,  and  they  all  felt  that  the  adventure  was  far more 
line 3434=>dangerous  than  they  had  thought,  while  all  the  time,  even  if  they  passed  all  the 
line 3435=>perils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end. 
line 3436=>All that morning they were busy with preparations. Soon after midday they ate 
line 3437=>with  Beorn  for  the  last  time,  and  after  the  meal  they  mounted  the  steeds  he  was 
line 3438=>lending  them, and bidding him many  farewells  they  rode off  through his gate at a 
line 3439=>good pace. 
line 3440=>As  soon as  they  left his high hedges at  the east of his  fenced lands they turned 
line 3441=>north  and  then  bore  to  the  north-west. By his  advice  they were no  longer making 
line 3442=>for  the main  forest-road to the south of his land. Had they followed the pass, their 
line 3443=>path  would  have  led  them  down  the  stream  from  the  mountains  that  joined  the 
line 3444=>great  river miles  south  of  the Carrock. At  that  point  there was  a  deep  ford which 
line 3445=>they might have passed,  if  they had  still had  their ponies, and beyond  that a  track 
line 3446=>led  to  the  skirts of  the wood and  to  the entrance of  the old  forest  road. But Beorn 
line 3447=>had  warned  them  that  that  way  was  now  often  used  by  the  goblins,  while  the 
line 3448=>forest-road itself, he bad heard, was overgrown and disused at the eastern end and 
line 3449=>led  to  impassable marshes where  the paths had  long been  lost.  Its eastern opening 
line 3450=>had also always been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain, and would have left 
line 3451=>them  still  with  a  long  and  difficult  northward  march  when  they  got  to  the  other 
line 3452=>side. 
line 3453=>
line 3454=>####-North  of  the Carrock  the  edge  of Mirkwood  drew  closer  to  the  borders  of  the 
line 3455=>Great River, and though here the Mountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised 
line 3456=>them to take this way; for at a place a few days' ride due north of the Carrock was 
line 3457=>the  gate  of  a  little-known  pathway  through  Mirkwood  that  led  almost  straight 
line 3458=>towards the Lonely Mountain. 
line 3459=>"The  goblins,"  Beorn  had  said,  "will  not  dare  to  cross  the  Great  River  for  a 
line 3460=>hundred  miles  north  of  the  Carrock  nor  to  come  near  my  house  –  it  is  well 
line 3461=>protected  at  night!–  but  I  should  ride  fast;  for  if  they  make  their  raid  soon  they 
line 3462=>will cross the river to the south  and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you 
line 3463=>off,  and  Wargs  run  swifter  than  ponies.  Still  you  are  safer  going  north,  even 
line 3464=>though you seem to be going back nearer to their strongholds; for that is what they 
line 3465=>will  least  expect,  and  they  will  have  the  longer  ride  to  catch  you.  Be  off  now  as 
line 3466=>quick as you may!" 
line 3467=>That  is  why  they  were  now  riding  in  silence,  galloping  wherever  the  ground 
line 3468=>was grassy and  smooth, with  the mountains dark on  their  left, and  in  the distance 
line 3469=>the line of the river with its trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just turned 
line 3470=>west  when  they  started,  and  till  evening  it  lay  golden  on  the  land  about  them.  It 
line 3471=>was  difficult  to  think  of  pursuing  goblins  behind,  and  when  they  had  put  many 
line 3472=>miles between them and Beorn's house they began to talk and to sing again and to 
line 3473=>forget  the  dark  forest-path  that  lay  in  front.  But  in  the  evening  when  the  dusk 
line 3474=>came on and  the peaks of  the mountains glowered against  the  sunset  they made a 
line 3475=>camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily with dreams in which there 
line 3476=>came  the  howl  of  hunting wolves  and  the  cries  of  goblins.  Still  the  next morning 
line 3477=>dawned bright and fair again. 
line 3478=>There  was  an  autumn-like mist  white  upon  the  ground  and  the  air  was  chill, 
line 3479=>but  soon  the  sun  rose  red  in  the  East  and  the  mists  vanished,  and  while  the 
line 3480=>shadows were still long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, 
line 3481=>and all  the while  they saw nothing save grass and  flowers and birds and scattered 
line 3482=>trees,  and  occasionally  small  herds  of  red  deer  browsing  or  sitting  at noon  in  the 
line 3483=>shade.  Sometimes  Bilbo  saw  the  horns  of  the  harts  sticking  up  out  of  the  long 
line 3484=>grass,  and  at  first  he  thought  they  were  the  dead  branches  of  trees.  That  third 
line 3485=>evening  they were so eager  to press on,  for Beorn had said  that  they should  reach 
line 3486=>the  forest-gate  early  on  the  fourth  day,  that  they  rode  still  forward  after  dusk  and 
line 3487=>into  the night beneath  the moon. As  the  light faded Bilbo  thought he saw away  to 
line 3488=>the  right,  or  to  the  left,  the  shadowy  form  of  a  great  bear  prowling  along  in  the 
line 3489=>same  direction.  But  if  he  dared  to  mention  it  to  Gandalf,  the  wizard  only  said: 
line 3490=>"Hush! Take no notice!" 
line 3491=>
line 3492=>####-Next day they started before dawn, though their night had been short. As soon 
line 3493=>as it was light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or waiting 
line 3494=>for  them  like a black and  frowning wall before  them. The  land began  to  slope up 
line 3495=>and  up,  and  it  seemed  to  the  hobbit  that  a  silence  began  to  draw  in  upon  them. 
line 3496=>Birds  began  to  sing  less.  There  were  no  more  deer;  not  even  rabbits  were  to  be 
line 3497=>seen. By  the  afternoon they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and were resting 
line 3498=>almost beneath  the great overhanging boughs of  its outer  trees. Their  trunks were 
line 3499=>huge  and  gnarled,  their  branches  twisted,  their  leaves  were  dark  and  long.  Ivy 
line 3500=>grew on them and trailed along the ground. 
line 3501=>"Well,  here  is  Mirkwood!"  said  Gandalf.  "The  greatest  of  the  forests  of  the 
line 3502=>Northern  world.  I  hope  you  like  the  look  of  it.  Now  you  must  send  back  these 
line 3503=>excellent ponies you have borrowed." 
line 3504=>The  dwarves  were  inclined  to  grumble  at  this,  but  the  wizard  told  them  they 
line 3505=>were  fools. "Beorn  is not as  far off as you seem  to  think, and you had better keep 
line 3506=>your promises  anyway,  for he  is  a bad  enemy. Mr. Baggins'  eyes  are  sharper  than 
line 3507=>yours,  if you have not seen each night after dark a great bear going along with us 
line 3508=>or sitting far of in the moon watching our camps. Not only to guard you and guide 
line 3509=>you, but to keep an eye on the ponies too. Beorn may be your friend, but he loves 
line 3510=>his animals as his children. You do not guess what kindness he has  shown you  in 
line 3511=>letting dwarves ride them so far and so fast, nor what would happen to you, if you 
line 3512=>tried to take them into the forest." 
line 3513=>"What  about  the  horse,  then?"  said  Thorin.  "You  don't  mention  sending  that 
line 3514=>back." 
line 3515=>"I don't, because I am not sending it." 
line 3516=>"What about your promise then?" 
line 3517=>"I will look after that. I am not sending the horse back, I am riding it!" 
line 3518=>Then  they  knew  that  Gandalf  was  going  to  leave  them  at  the  very  edge  of 
line 3519=>Mirkwood, and they were in despair.  
line 3520=>But nothing they could say would change his mind. 
line 3521=>"Now we had this all out before, when we landed on the Carrock," he said. "It 
line 3522=>is no use arguing. I have, as I  told you, some pressing business away south; and I 
line 3523=>am already late through bothering with you people. We may meet again before all 
line 3524=>is  over,  and  then  again of  course we may not. That depends on your  luck  and on 
line 3525=>your courage and  sense; and  I am  sending Mr. Baggins with you.  I have  told you 
line 3526=>before  that  he  has  more  about  him  than  you  guess,  and  you  will  find  that  out 
line 3527=>before  long.  So  cheer  up  Bilbo  and  don't  look  so  glum.  Cheer  up  Thorin  and 
line 3528=>
line 3529=>####-Company! This  is  your  expedition  after  all. Think  of  the  treasure  at  the  end,  and 
line 3530=>forget the forest and the dragon, at any rate until tomorrow morning!" 
line 3531=>When tomorrow morning came he still said the same. 
line 3532=>So  now  there  was  nothing  left  to  do  but  to  fill  their  water-skins  at  a  clear 
line 3533=>spring they found close to the forest-gate, and unpack the ponies. They distributed 
line 3534=>the  packages  as  fairly  as  they  could,  though  Bilbo  thought  his  lot  was 
line 3535=>wearisomely heavy, and did not at all like  the idea of trudging for miles and miles 
line 3536=>with all that on his back. 
line 3537=>"Don't you worry!" said Thorin. "It will get  lighter all  too soon. Before  long  I 
line 3538=>expect we shall all wish our packs heavier, when the food begins to run short." 
line 3539=>Then  at  last  they  said  good-bye  to  their  ponies  and  turned  their  heads  for 
line 3540=>home.  Off  they  trotted  gaily,  seeming  very  glad  to  put  their  tails  towards  the 
line 3541=>shadow of Mirkwood. As they went away Bilbo could have sworn that a thing like 
line 3542=>a bear left the shadow of the trees and shambled off quickly after them. 
line 3543=>Now Gandalf  too  said  farewell. Bilbo  sat on  the ground  feeling very unhappy 
line 3544=>and wishing he was beside the wizard on his tall horse. He had gone just inside the 
line 3545=>forest  after  breakfast  (a  very  poor  one),  and  it  had  seemed  as  dark  in  there  in  the 
line 3546=>morning  as  at  night,  and  very  secret:  "a  sort  of watching  and waiting  feeling,"  he 
line 3547=>said to himself. 
line 3548=>"Good-bye!"  said  Gandalf  to  Thorin.  "And  good-bye  to  you  all,  good-bye! 
line 3549=>Straight through the forest is your way now. Don't stray off the track!-if you do, it 
line 3550=>is  a  thousand  to one you will never  find  it  again  and never get out of Mirkwood; 
line 3551=>and then I don't suppose I, or any one else, will ever see you again." 
line 3552=>"Do we really have to go through?" groaned the hobbit. 
line 3553=>"Yes, you do!" said the wizard, "if  you want to get to the other side. You must 
line 3554=>either go through or give up your quest. And I am not going to allow you to back 
line 3555=>out  now,  Mr.  Baggins.  I  am  ashamed  of  you  for  thinking  of  it.  You  have  got  to 
line 3556=>look after all these dwarves for me," he laughed. 
line 3557=>"No! no!" said Bilbo. "I didn't mean that. I meant, is there no way round?" 
line 3558=>"There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and 
line 3559=>twice  that  south.  But  you  wouldn't  get  a  safe  path  even  then.  There  are  no  safe 
line 3560=>paths  in  this part of  the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, 
line 3561=>and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before you could get round Mirkwood 
line 3562=>in  the  North  you  would  be  right  among  the  slopes  of  the  Grey  Mountains,  and 
line 3563=>they  are  simply  stiff  with  goblins,  hobgoblins,  and  rest  of  the  worst  description. 
line 3564=>Before  you  could  get  round  it  in  the  South,  you  would  get  into  the  land  of  the 
line 3565=>Necromancer;  and  even  you.  Bilbo, won't  need me  to  tell  you  tales  of  that  black 
line 3566=>
line 3567=>####-sorcerer. I don't advise you to go anywhere near the places overlooked by his dark 
line 3568=>tower! Stick  to  the  forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the best, and with a 
line 3569=>tremendous  slice  of  luck  you  may  come  out  one  day  and  see  the  Long  Marshes 
line 3570=>lying  below  you,  and  beyond  them,  high  in  the East,  the Lonely Mountain where 
line 3571=>dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting you." 
line 3572=>"Very  comforting  you  are  to  be  sure,"  growled  Thorin.  "Good-bye!  If  you 
line 3573=>won't come with us, you had better get off without any more talk!" 
line 3574=>"Good-bye  then,  and  really  good-bye!"  said  Gandalf,  and  he  turned  his  horse 
line 3575=>and  rode  down  into  the West.  But  he  could  not  resist  the  temptation  to  have  the 
line 3576=>last word. Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to 
line 3577=>his mouth  and  called  to  them. They  heard  his  voice  come  faintly:  "Good-bye! Be 
line 3578=>good, take care of yourselves-and DON'T LEAVE THE PATH!" 
line 3579=>Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. "O good-bye and go away!" 
line 3580=>grunted  the  dwarves,  all  the  more  angry  because  they  were  really  filled  with 
line 3581=>dismay at losing him. Now began the most dangerous part of all the journey.  
line 3582=>They  each  shouldered  the  heavy  pack  and  the  water-skin  which  was  their 
line 3583=>share, and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the 
line 3584=>forest.  
line 3585=> 
line 3586=>
line 3587=>####-<h4>Chapter 8 </h4> <br>
line 3588=>
line 3589=>Flies and Spiders 
line 3590=>
line 3591=> 
line 3592=>They  walked  in  single  file.  The  entrance  to  the  path  was  like  a  sort  of  arch 
line 3593=>leading  into  a  gloomy  tunnel made  by  two  great  trees  that  leant  together,  too  old 
line 3594=>and  strangled  with  ivy  and  hung  with  lichen  to  bear  more  than  a  few  blackened 
line 3595=>leaves. The  path  itself was  narrow and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon 
line 3596=>the  light  at  the  gate  was  like  a  little  bright  hole  far  behind,  and  the  quiet  was  so 
line 3597=>deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and 
line 3598=>listened. As  theft  eyes  became  used  to  the  dimness  they  could  see  a  little way  to 
line 3599=>either  side  in  a  sort  of  darkened  green  glimmer.  Occasionally  a  slender  beam  of 
line 3600=>sun  that had  the  luck  to slip  in  through some opening  in  the  leaves far above, and 
line 3601=>still  more  luck  in  not  being  caught  in  the  tangled  boughs  and  matted  twigs 
line 3602=>beneath,  stabbed  down  thin  and  bright  before  them.  But  this  was  seldom,  and  it 
line 3603=>soon ceased altogether.  
line 3604=>There were  black  squirrels  in  the wood. As  Bilbo's  sharp  inquisitive  eyes  got 
line 3605=>used  to  seeing  things  he  could  catch  glimpses  of  them whisking  off  the  path  and 
line 3606=>scuttling  behind  tree-trunks.  There  were  queer  noises  too,  grunts,  scufflings,  and 
line 3607=>hurryings  in  the undergrowth, and among  the  leaves  that  lay piled endlessly  thick 
line 3608=>in  places  on  the  forest-floor;  but  what  made  the  noises  he  could  not  see.  The 
line 3609=>nastiest  things  they  saw  were  the  cobwebs:  dark  dense  cobwebs  with  threads 
line 3610=>extraordinarily  thick,  often  stretched  from  tree  to  tree,  or  tangled  in  the  lower 
line 3611=>branches  on  either  side  of  them.  There  were  none  stretched  across  the  path,  but 
line 3612=>whether because some magic kept it clear, or for what other reason they could not 
line 3613=>guess. 
line 3614=>It was not long before they grew to hate the forest as heartily as they had hated 
line 3615=>the tunnels of the goblins, and it seemed to offer even less hope of any ending. But 
line 3616=>they had to go on and on, long after they were sick for a sight of the sun and of the 
line 3617=>sky, and  longed for  the feel of wind on  their faces. There was no movement of air 
line 3618=>down under the forest-roof, and it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy. Even 
line 3619=>the dwarves felt it, who were used to tunnelling, and lived at times for long whiles 
line 3620=>without the light of the sun; but the hobbit, who liked holes to make a house in but 
line 3621=>not to spend summer days in, felt he was being slowly suffocated. 
line 3622=>The nights were the worst. It then became pitch-dark – not what you call pitch-
line 3623=>dark,  but  really  pitch;  so  black  that  you  really  could  see  nothing.  Bilbo  tried 
line 3624=>flapping his hand in front of his nose, but he could not see it at all. Well, perhaps it 
line 3625=>
line 3626=>####-is  not  true  to  say  that  they  could  see  nothing:  they  could  see  eyes. They  slept  all 
line 3627=>closely  huddled  together,  and  took  it  in  turns  to  watch;  and  when  it  was  Bilbo's 
line 3628=>turn  he  would  see  gleams  in  the  darkness  round  them,  and  sometimes  pairs  of 
line 3629=>yellow  or  red  or  green  eyes  would  stare  at  him  from  a  little  distance,  and  then 
line 3630=>slowly  fade  and  disappear  and  slowly  shine  out  again  in  another  place.  And 
line 3631=>sometimes  they  would  gleam  down  from  the  branches  just  above  him;  and  that 
line 3632=>was most terrifying. But the eyes that he liked the least were horrible pale bulbous 
line 3633=>sort  of  eyes.  "Insect  eyes"  he  thought,  "not  animal  eyes,  only  they  are  much  too 
line 3634=>big." 
line 3635=>Although  it was  not  yet  very  cold,  they  tried  lighting watch-fires at night, but 
line 3636=>they  soon  gave  that  up.  It  seemed  to  bring  hundreds  and  hundreds  of  eyes  all 
line 3637=>round  them,  though  the  creatures,  whatever  they  were,  were  careful  never  to  let 
line 3638=>their bodies show in the little flicker of the flames. Worse still it brought thousands 
line 3639=>of  dark-grey  and  black  moths,  some  nearly  as  big  as  your  hand,  flapping  and 
line 3640=>whirring  round their ears. They could not stand that, nor the huge bats, black as a 
line 3641=>top-hat,  either;  so  they  gave  up  fires  and  sat  at  night  and  dozed  in  the  enormous 
line 3642=>uncanny darkness. 
line 3643=>All  this  went  on  for  what  seemed  to  the  hobbit  ages  upon  ages;  and  he  was 
line 3644=>always  hungry,  for  they were extremely careful with  their provisions. Even  so, as 
line 3645=>days  followed  days,  and  still  the  forest  seemed  just  the  same,  they  began  to  get 
line 3646=>anxious. The  food would not  last  for  ever:  it was  in  fact  already beginning  to get 
line 3647=>low. They tried shooting at the squirrels, and they wasted many arrows before they 
line 3648=>managed  to  bring  one  down  on  the  path.  But  when  they  roasted  it,  it  proved 
line 3649=>horrible to taste, and they shot no more squirrels. 
line 3650=>They  were  thirsty  too,  for  they  had  none  too  much  water,  and  in  all  the  time 
line 3651=>they  had  seen  neither  spring  nor  stream.  This  was  their  state  when  one  day  they 
line 3652=>found their path blocked by a running water. It flowed fast and strong but not very 
line 3653=>wide right across  the way, and  it was black, or  looked  it  in  the gloom. It was well 
line 3654=>that  Beorn  had  warned  them  against  it,  or  they  would  have  drunk  from  it, 
line 3655=>whatever  its  colour,  and  filled  some  of  their  emptied  skins  at  its  bank. As  it was 
line 3656=>they only thought of how to cross it without wetting themselves in its water. There 
line 3657=>had  been  a  bridge  of  wood  across,  but  it  had  rotted  and  fallen  leaving  only  the 
line 3658=>broken posts near the bank. 
line 3659=>Bilbo kneeling on the brink and peering forward cried: "There is a boat against 
line 3660=>the far bank! Now why couldn't it have been this side!" 
line 3661=>"How far away do you think it is?" asked Thorin, for by now they knew Bilbo 
line 3662=>had the sharpest eyes among them. 
line 3663=>
line 3664=>####-"Not at all far. I shouldn't think above twelve yards." 
line 3665=>"Twelve  yards!  I  should  have  thought  it was  thirty  at  least,  but my  eyes  don't 
line 3666=>see  as  well  as  they  used  a  hundred  years  ago.  Still  twelve  yards  is  as  good  as  a 
line 3667=>mile. We can't jump it, and we daren't try to wade or swim." 
line 3668=>"Can any of you throw a rope?" 
line 3669=>"What's the good of that? The boat is sure to be tied up, even if we could hook 
line 3670=>it, which I doubt." 
line 3671=>"I  don't  believe  it  is  tied,"  said Bilbo,  "though of  course  I  can't be  sure  in  this 
line 3672=>light;  but  it  looks  to me  as  if  it was  just  drawn  up  on  the  bank, which  is  low  just 
line 3673=>there where the path goes down into the water." 
line 3674=>"Dori is the strongest, but Fili is the youngest and still  has the best sight," said 
line 3675=>Thorin.  "Come  here  Fili,  and  see  if  you  can  see  the  boat  Mr.  Baggins  is  talking 
line 3676=>about." 
line 3677=>Fili thought he could; so when he had stared a long while to get an idea of the 
line 3678=>direction,  the  others  brought  him  a  rope.  They  had  several with  them, and on  the 
line 3679=>end  of  the  longest  they  fastened  one  of  the  large  iron  hooks  they  had  used  for 
line 3680=>catching  their packs  to  the  straps  about  their  shoulders. Fili  took  this  in his hand, 
line 3681=>balanced it for a moment, and then flung it across the stream. 
line 3682=>Splash  it  fell  in  the  water!  "Not  far  enough!"  said  Bilbo  who  was  peering 
line 3683=>forward.  "A  couple  of  feet  and  you  would  have  dropped  it  on  to  the  boat.  Try 
line 3684=>again.  I don't  suppose  the magic  is  strong  enough  to hurt you,  if you  just  touch  a 
line 3685=>bit of wet rope." 
line 3686=>Fili  picked  up  the  hook when  he  had  drawn  it  back,  rather  doubtfully  all  the 
line 3687=>same. This time he threw it with greater strength. 
line 3688=>"Steady!" said Bilbo, "you have thrown it right into the wood on the other side 
line 3689=>now.  Draw  it  back  gently."  Fili  hauled  the  rope  back  slowly,  and  after  a  while 
line 3690=>Bilbo said: 
line 3691=>"Carefully! It is lying on the boat; let's hope the hook will catch." 
line 3692=>It  did.  The  rope went  taut,  and  Fili  pulled  in  vain. Kili  came  to  his  help,  and 
line 3693=>then  Oin  and  Gloin.  They  tugged  and  tugged,  and  suddenly  they  all  fell  over  on 
line 3694=>their backs. Bilbo was on  the  lockout, however, caught  the rope, and with a piece 
line 3695=>of  stick  fended  off  the  little  black  boat  as  it  came  rushing  across  the  stream. 
line 3696=>"Help!"  he  shouted,  and Balin was  just  in  time  to  seize  the  boat  before  it  floated 
line 3697=>off down the current. 
line 3698=>"It  was  tied  after  all,"  said  he,  looking  at  the  snapped  painter  that  was  still 
line 3699=>dangling  from  it.  "That  was  a  good  pull,  my  lads;  and  a  good  job  that  our  rope 
line 3700=>was the stronger." 
line 3701=>
line 3702=>####-"Who'll cross first?" asked Bilbo. 
line 3703=>"I  shall,"  said Thorin,  "and  you will come with me, and Fili and Balin. That's 
line 3704=>as  many  as  the  boat  will  hold  at  a  time.  After  that  Kili  and  Oin  and  Gloin  and 
line 3705=>Don; next On and Nori, Bifur and Bofur; and last Dwalin and Bombur." 
line 3706=>"I'm  always  last  and  I  don't  like  it,"  said  Bombur.  "It's  somebody  else's  turn 
line 3707=>today." 
line 3708=>"You  should  not  be  so  fat. As  you  are,  you must  be with  the  last  and  lightest 
line 3709=>boatload.  Don't  start  grumbling  against  orders,  or  something  bad  will  happen  to 
line 3710=>you." 
line 3711=>"There  aren't  any  oars.  How  are  you  going  to  push  the  boat  back  to  the  far 
line 3712=>bank?" asked the hobbit. 
line 3713=>"Give me  another  length  of  rope  and  another  hook,"  said  Fili,  and when  they 
line 3714=>had got  it  ready, he cast  into  the darkness ahead and as high as he could  throw  it. 
line 3715=>Since  it did not  fall down again,  they saw  that  it must have stuck in the branches. 
line 3716=>"Get  in now," said Fili, "and one of you haul on  the rope  that  is stuck  in a  tree on 
line 3717=>the other  side. One of  the others must keep hold of  the hook we used  at  first,  and 
line 3718=>when we  are  safe  on  the  other  side  he  can  hook  it  on,  and  you  can draw  the boat 
line 3719=>back." 
line 3720=>In  this  way  they  were  all  soon  on  the  far  bank  safe  across  the  enchanted 
line 3721=>stream.  Dwalin  had  just  scrambled  out  with  the  coiled  rope  on  his  arm,  and 
line 3722=>Bombur  (still  grumbling)  was  getting  ready  to  follow,  when  something  bad  did 
line 3723=>happen. There was a  flying  sound of hooves on  the path ahead. Out of  the gloom 
line 3724=>came suddenly  the shape of a  flying deer.  It charged  into  the dwarves and bowled 
line 3725=>them  over,  then  gathered  itself  for  a  leap.  High  it  sprang  and  cleared  the  water 
line 3726=>with  a  mighty  jump.  But  it  did  not  reach  the  other  side  in  safety. Thorin was  the 
line 3727=>only  one  who  had  kept  his  feet  and  his  wits.  As  soon  as  they  had  landed  he  had 
line 3728=>bent his bow and fitted an arrow in case any hidden guardian of the boat appeared. 
line 3729=>Now he  sent  a  swift  and  sure  shot  into the leaping beast. As it reached the further 
line 3730=>bank  it  stumbled.  The  shadows  swallowed  it  up,  but  they  heard  the  sound  of 
line 3731=>hooves quickly falter and then go still. 
line 3732=>Before  they  could  shout  in  praise  of  the  shot,  however,  a  dreadful  wail  from 
line 3733=>Bilbo  put  all  thoughts  of  venison  out  of  their  minds.  "Bombur  has  fallen  in! 
line 3734=>Bombur is drowning!" he cried. It was only too true. Bombur had only one foot on 
line 3735=>the land when the hart bore down on him, and sprang over him. He had stumbled, 
line 3736=>thrusting the boat away from the bank, and then toppled back into the dark water, 
line 3737=>his  hands  slipping  off  the  slimy  roots  at  the  edge,  while  the  boat  span  slowly  off 
line 3738=>and disappeared. 
line 3739=>
line 3740=>####-They  could  still  see  his  hood  above  the  water  when  they  ran  to  the  bank. 
line 3741=>Quickly  they  flung  a  rope with  a  hook towards him. His hand caught it, and they 
line 3742=>pulled  him  to  the  shore.  He  was  drenched  from  hair  to  boots,  of  course,  but  that 
line 3743=>was  not  the  worst.  When  they  laid  him  on  the  bank  he  was  already  fast  asleep, 
line 3744=>with one hand clutching the rope so tight that they could not get it from his grasp; 
line 3745=>and  fast asleep he  remained  in  spite of all  they could do. They were  still  standing 
line 3746=>over him,  cursing  their  ill  luck,  and Bombur's  clumsiness,  and  lamenting  the  loss 
line 3747=>of  the  boat  which  made  it  impossible  for  them  to  go  back  and  look  for  the  hart, 
line 3748=>when  they became  aware of  the dim blowing of horns  in  the wood  and  the  sound 
line 3749=>as  of  dogs  baying  far  off.  Then  they  all  fell  silent;  and  as  they  sat  it  seemed  they 
line 3750=>could hear  the noise of a great hunt going by  to  the north of  the path, though they 
line 3751=>saw no sign of it. There they sat for a long while and did not dare to make a move. 
line 3752=>Bombur  slept  on with  a  smile  on  his  fat  face,  as  if  he  no  longer  cared  for  all  the 
line 3753=>troubles that vexed them. 
line 3754=>Suddenly  on  the  path  ahead  appeared  some  white  deer,  a  hind  and  fawns  as 
line 3755=>snowy  white  as  the  hart  had  been  dark.  They  glimmered  in  the  shadows.  Before 
line 3756=>Thorin  could  cry  out  three  of  the  dwarves  had  leaped  to  their  feet  and  loosed  off 
line 3757=>arrows  from  their  bows.  None  seemed  to  find  their  mark.  The  deer  turned  and 
line 3758=>vanished  in  the  trees  as  silently  as  they  had  come,  and  in  vain  the  dwarves  shot 
line 3759=>their arrows after them. 
line 3760=>"Stop!  stop!"  shouted  Thorin;  but  it  was  too  late,  the  excited  dwarves  had 
line 3761=>wasted  their  last  arrows,  and  now  the  bows  that  Beorn  had  given  them  were 
line 3762=>useless. 
line 3763=>They  were  a  gloomy  party  that  night,  and  the  gloom  gathered  still  deeper  on 
line 3764=>them in the following days. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond it 
line 3765=>the  path  seemed  to  straggle  on  just  as  before,  and  in  the  forest  they  could  see  no 
line 3766=>change.  Yet  if  they  had  known  more  about  it  and  considered  the  meaning  of  the 
line 3767=>hunt  and  the  white  deer  that  had  appeared  upon  their  path,  they  would  have 
line 3768=>known  that  they  were  at  last  drawing  towards  the  eastern  edge,  and  would  soon 
line 3769=>have  come,  if  they  could  have  kept  up  their  courage  and  their  hope,  to  thinner 
line 3770=>trees and places where the sunlight came again. 
line 3771=>But  they  did  not  know  this,  and  they  were  burdened  with  the  heavy  body  of 
line 3772=>Bombur,  which  they  had  to  carry  along  with  them  as  best  they  could,  taking  the 
line 3773=>wearisome  task  in  turns  of  four  each while  the  others  shared  their  packs.  If  these 
line 3774=>had not become all too light in the last few days, they would never have managed 
line 3775=>it;  but  a  slumbering  and  smiling  Bombur  was  a  poor  exchange  for  packs  filled 
line 3776=>with  food  however  heavy.  In  a  few  days  a  time  came when  there was  practically 
line 3777=>
line 3778=>####-nothing  left  to  eat  or  to  drink. Nothing wholesome  could  they  see  growing  in  the 
line 3779=>woods, only funguses and herbs with pale leaves and unpleasant smell. 
line 3780=>About four days from the enchanted stream they  came to a part where most of 
line 3781=>the trees were beeches. They were at first inclined to be cheered by the change, for 
line 3782=>here  there  was  no  undergrowth  and  the  shadow  was  not  so  deep.  There  was  a 
line 3783=>greenish light about them, and in places they could see some distance to either side 
line 3784=>of  the  path.  Yet  the  light  only  showed  them  endless  lines  of  straight  grey  trunks 
line 3785=>like the pillars of some huge twilight hall. There was a breath of air and a noise of 
line 3786=>wind,  but  it  had  a  sad  sound.  A  few  leaves  came  rustling  down  to  remind  them 
line 3787=>that  outside  autumn was  coming  on.  Their  feet  ruffled  among  the  dead  leaves  of 
line 3788=>countless other  autumns  that drifted over  the banks of  the path  from  the deep  red 
line 3789=>carpets of the forest. 
line 3790=>Still Bombur  slept  and  they grew very weary. At  times  they heard disquieting 
line 3791=>laughter.  Sometimes  there  was  singing  in  the  distance  too.  The  laughter  was  the 
line 3792=>laughter of fair voices not of goblins, and the singing was beautiful, but it sounded 
line 3793=>eerie and  strange, and  they were not comforted,  rather  they hurried on  from  those 
line 3794=>parts with what strength they had left. 
line 3795=>Two  days  later  they  found  their  path  going  downwards  and  before  long  they 
line 3796=>were in a valley filled almost entirely with a mighty growth of oaks. 
line 3797=>"Is there no end to this accursed forest?" said Thorin. 
line 3798=>"Somebody must climb a tree and see if he can get his head above the roof and 
line 3799=>have  a  look  round.  The  only  way  is  to  choose  the  tallest  tree  that  overhangs  the 
line 3800=>path." 
line 3801=>Of course "somebody" meant Bilbo. They chose him because  to be of any use 
line 3802=>the  climber  must  get  his  head  above  the  topmost  leaves,  and  so  he must  be  light 
line 3803=>enough for the highest and slenderest branches to bear him. Poor Mr. Baggins had 
line 3804=>never had much practice in climbing trees, but they hoisted him up into the lowest 
line 3805=>branches of an enormous oak that grew right out into the path, and up he had to go 
line 3806=>as best he could. He pushed his way through the tangled twigs with many a slap in 
line 3807=>the eye; he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs; more 
line 3808=>than  once  he  slipped  and  caught  himself  just  in  time; and at  last, after a dreadful 
line 3809=>struggle  in  a  difficult  place  where  there  seemed  to  be  no  convenient  branches  at 
line 3810=>all, he got near the top. All the time he was wondering whether there were spiders 
line 3811=>in the tree, and how he was going to get down again (except by falling). 
line 3812=>In  the  end  he  poked  his  head  above  the  roof  of  leaves,  and  then  he  found 
line 3813=>spiders  all  right.  But  they  were  only  small  ones  of  ordinary  size,  and  they  were 
line 3814=>after  the  butterflies.  Bilbo's  eyes  were  nearly  blinded  by  the  light.  He  could  hear 
line 3815=>
line 3816=>####-the dwarves shouting up at him from far below, but he could not answer, only hold 
line 3817=>on  and  blink.  The  sun  was  shining  brilliantly,  and  it  was  a  long  while  before  he 
line 3818=>could  bear  it. When  he  could,  he  saw  all  round  him  a  sea  of  dark  green,  ruffled 
line 3819=>here  and  there  by the breeze; and there were everywhere hundreds of butterflies. I 
line 3820=>expect  they were a kind of  'purple emperor,' a butterfly  that  loves  the  tops of oak-
line 3821=>woods,  but  these  were  not  purple  at  all,  they  were  a  dark  dark  velvety  black 
line 3822=>without any markings to be seen. 
line 3823=>He  looked  at  the  'black  emperors'  for  a  long  time,  and  enjoyed  the  feel  of  the 
line 3824=>breeze in his hair and on his face; but at length the cries of the dwarves, who were 
line 3825=>now  simply  stamping  with  impatience  down  below,  reminded  him  of  his  real 
line 3826=>business.  It  was  no  good.  Gaze  as much  as  he might,  he  could  see  no  end  to  the 
line 3827=>trees  and  the  leaves  in  any  direction.  His  heart,  that  had  been  lightened  by  the 
line 3828=>sight of the sun and the feel of the wind, sank back into his toes: there was no food 
line 3829=>to go back to down below.  
line 3830=>Actually, as I have told you, they were not far off the edge of the forest; and if 
line 3831=>Bilbo had had the sense to see it, the tree that he had climbed, though it was tall in 
line 3832=>itself, was standing near  the bottom of a wide valley, so  that  from  its  top  the  trees 
line 3833=>seemed  to  swell  up  all  round  like  the  edges  of  a  great  bowl,  and  he  could  not 
line 3834=>expect  to  see  how  far  the  forest  lasted.  Still  he  did  not  see  this,  and  he  climbed 
line 3835=>down  full  of  despair.  He  got  to  the  bottom  again  at  last  scratched,  hot,  and 
line 3836=>miserable,  and  he  could  not  see  anything  in  the  gloom  below  when  he  got  there. 
line 3837=>His report soon made the others as miserable as he was. 
line 3838=>"The forest goes on for ever and ever and ever in all directions! Whatever shall 
line 3839=>we do? And what  is  the use of sending a hobbit!"  they cried, as if it was his fault. 
line 3840=>They did not care tuppence about the butterflies, and were only made more angry 
line 3841=>when he told them of the beautiful breeze, which they were too heavy to climb up 
line 3842=>and feel. 
line 3843=> 
line 3844=>That  night  they  ate  their  very  last  scraps  and  crumbs  of  food;  and  next 
line 3845=>morning  when  they  woke  the  first  thing  they  noticed  was  that  they  were  still 
line 3846=>gnawingly  hungry,  and  the  next  thing  was  that  it  was  raining  and  that  here  and 
line 3847=>there  the  drip  of  it  was  dropping  heavily  on  the  forest  floor.  That  only  reminded 
line 3848=>them  that  they  were  also  parchingly  thirsty,  without  doing  anything  to  relieve 
line 3849=>them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting 
line 3850=>for  a  chance  drip  to  fall  on  your  tongue.  The  only  scrap  of  comfort  there  was, 
line 3851=>came unexpectedly from Bombur.  
line 3852=>
line 3853=>####-He woke  up  suddenly  and  sat  up  scratching  his  head. He  could  not make  out 
line 3854=>where  he  was  at  all,  nor  why  he  felt  so  hungry;  for  he  had  forgotten  everything 
line 3855=>that  had  happened  since  they  started  their  journey  that  May  morning  long  ago. 
line 3856=>The  last  thing  that  he  remembered  was  the  party  at  the  hobbit's  house,  and  they 
line 3857=>had  great  difficulty  in  making  him  believe  their  tale  of  all  the  many  adventures 
line 3858=>they had had since. 
line 3859=>When he heard that there was nothing to eat, he sat down and wept, for he felt 
line 3860=>very  weak  and  wobbly  in  the  legs.  "Why  ever  did  I  wake  up!"  he  cried.  "I  was 
line 3861=>having such beautiful dreams. I dreamed I was walking in a forest rather like this 
line 3862=>one,  only  lit with  torches  on  the  trees  and  lamps  swinging  from  the  branches  and 
line 3863=>fires  burning  on  the  ground;  and  there  was  a  great  feast  going  on,  going  on  for 
line 3864=>ever.  A  woodland  king  was  there  with  a  crown  of  leaves,  and  there  was  a merry 
line 3865=>singing, and I could not count or describe the things there were to eat and drink." 
line 3866=>"You need not try," said Thorin. "In fact if you can't talk about something else, 
line 3867=>you  had  better  be  silent.  We  are  quite  annoyed  enough  with  you  as  it  is.  If  you 
line 3868=>hadn't waked up, we should have left you to your idiotic dreams in the forest; you 
line 3869=>are no joke to carry even after weeks of short commons." 
line 3870=>There  was  nothing  now  to  be  done  but  to  tighten  the  belts  round  their  empty 
line 3871=>stomachs,  and  hoist  their  empty  sacks  and  packs,  and  trudge  along  the  track 
line 3872=>without any great hope of ever getting to the end before they lay down and died of 
line 3873=>starvation.  This  they  did  all  that  day,  going  very  slowly  and  wearily,  while 
line 3874=>Bombur  kept  on wailing  that  his  legs would  not  carry  him  and  that  he wanted  to 
line 3875=>lie down and sleep. 
line 3876=>"No you don't!" they said. "Let your legs take their share, we have carried you 
line 3877=>far enough." 
line 3878=>All  the same he suddenly refused  to go a step further and flung himself on  the 
line 3879=>ground.  "Go  on,  if  you  must,"  he  said.  "I'm  just  going  to  lie  here  and  sleep  and 
line 3880=>dream of food, if I can't get it any other way. I hope I never wake up again." 
line 3881=>At that very moment Balin, who was a little way ahead, called out: "What was 
line 3882=>that? I thought I saw a twinkle of light in the forest." 
line 3883=>They  all  looked,  and  a  longish  way  off,  it  seemed,  they  saw  a  red  twinkle  in 
line 3884=>the dark; then another and another sprang out beside it. Even Bombur got up, and 
line 3885=>they hurried along then, not caring if it was trolls or goblins. The light was in front 
line 3886=>of them and to the left of the path, and when at last they had drawn level with it, it 
line 3887=>seemed  plain  that  torches  and  fires were  burning  under  the  trees, but a good way 
line 3888=>off their track. 
line 3889=>
line 3890=>####-"It  looks  as  if  my  dreams  were  coming  true,"  gasped  Bombur  puffing  up 
line 3891=>behind. He wanted to rush straight off into the wood after the lights. But the others 
line 3892=>remembered  only  too  well  the  warnings  of  the  wizard  and  of  Beorn.  "A  feast 
line 3893=>would be no good, if we never got back alive from it," said Thorin. 
line 3894=>"But  without  a  feast  we  shan't  remain  alive  much  longer  anyway,"  said 
line 3895=>Bombur, and Bilbo heartily agreed with him. They argued about it backwards and 
line 3896=>forwards for a long while, until they agreed at length to send out a couple of spies, 
line 3897=>to  creep  near  the  lights  and  find  out  more  about  them.  But  then  they  could  not 
line 3898=>agree  on  who  was  to  be  sent:  no  one  seemed  anxious  to  run  the  chance  of  being 
line 3899=>lost  and  never  finding  his  friends  again.  In  the  end,  in  spite  of  warnings,  hunger 
line 3900=>decided  them,  because  Bombur  kept  on  describing  all  the  good  things  that  were 
line 3901=>being eaten, according to his dream, in the woodland feast; so they all left the path 
line 3902=>and plunged into the forest together.  
line 3903=>After  a  good  deal  of  creeping  and  crawling  they  peered  round  the  trunks  and 
line 3904=>looked  into  a  clearing where  some  trees  had  been  felled  and  the  ground  levelled. 
line 3905=>There were many people there, elvish-looking folk, all dressed in green and brown 
line 3906=>and  sitting  on  sawn  rings  of  the  felled  trees  in  a  great  circle.  There was  a  fire  in 
line 3907=>their midst  and  there were  torches  fastened  to  some  of  the  trees  round  about;  but 
line 3908=>most splendid sight of all: they were eating and drinking and laughing merrily.  
line 3909=>The smell of the roast meats was so enchanting that, without waiting to consult 
line 3910=>one  another,  every  one  of  them  got  up  and  scrambled  forwards  into  the  ring with 
line 3911=>the  one  idea  of  begging  for  some  food.  No  sooner  had  the  first  stepped  into  the 
line 3912=>clearing  than all  the  lights went out as  if by magic. Somebody kicked the fire and 
line 3913=>it  went  up  in  rockets  of  glittering  sparks  and  vanished.  They  were  lost  in  a 
line 3914=>completely  lightless dark and  they could not even find one another, not for a  long 
line 3915=>time  at  any  rate.  After  blundering  frantically  in  the  gloom,  falling  over  logs, 
line 3916=>bumping  crash  into  trees,  and  shouting  and  calling  till  they  must  have  waked 
line 3917=>everything  in  the  forest  for miles,  at  last  they managed  to  gather  themselves  in  a 
line 3918=>bundle  and  count  themselves  by  touch.  By  that  time  they  had,  of  course,  quite 
line 3919=>forgotten  in what direction  the path  lay,  and  they were  all hopelessly  lost,  at  least 
line 3920=>till morning. 
line 3921=>There was nothing for it but to settle down for the night where they were; they 
line 3922=>did not  even dare  to  search on  the ground  for  scraps of  food  for  fear of becoming 
line 3923=>separated again. But they had not been lying long, and Bilbo was only just getting 
line 3924=>drowsy, when Dori, whose turn it was to watch first, said in a loud whisper: 
line 3925=>"The  lights  are  coming  out  again  over  there,  and  there  are more  than  ever  of 
line 3926=>them." 
line 3927=>
line 3928=>####-Up they all jumped. There, sure enough, not far away were scores of twinkling 
line 3929=>lights, and  they heard  the voices and  the  laughter quite plainly. They crept slowly 
line 3930=>towards  them,  in  a  single  line,  each  touching  the  back  of  the  one  in  front. When 
line 3931=>they  got  near Thorin  said:  "No  rushing  forward  this  time! No  one  is  to  stir  from 
line 3932=>hiding till I say. I shall send Mr. Baggins alone first to talk to them. They won't be 
line 3933=>frightened  of  him-('What  about me  of  them?'  thought  Bilbo)-and any way  I hope 
line 3934=>they won't do anything nasty to him." 
line 3935=>When  they  got  to  the  edge  of  the  circle  of  lights  they  pushed  Bilbo  suddenly 
line 3936=>from behind. Before he had  time  to  slip on his  ring, he  stumbled  forward  into  the 
line 3937=>full blaze of the fire and torches. It was no good. Out went all the lights again and 
line 3938=>complete darkness fell. If  it had been difficult collecting  themselves before,  it was 
line 3939=>far  worse  this  time.  And  they  simply  could  not  find  the  hobbit.  Every  time  they 
line 3940=>counted  themselves  it  only  made  thirteen.  They  shouted  and  called:  "Bilbo 
line 3941=>Baggins!  Hobbit!  You  dratted  hobbit!  Hi!  hobbit,  confusticate  you,  where  are 
line 3942=>you?" and other things of that sort, but there was no answer.  
line 3943=>They were just giving up hope, when Dori stumbled across him by sheer luck. 
line 3944=>In the dark he fell over what he thought was a log, and he found it was the hobbit 
line 3945=>curled  up  fast  asleep.  It  took  a  deal  of  shaking  to  wake  him,  and  when  he  was 
line 3946=>awake he was not pleased at all. 
line 3947=>"I  was  having  such  a  lovely  dream,"  he  grumbled,  "all  about  having  a  most 
line 3948=>gorgeous dinner." 
line 3949=>"Good  heavens!  he  has  gone  like  Bombur,"  they  said.  "Don't  tell  us  about 
line 3950=>dreams. Dream-dinners aren't any good, and we can't share them." 
line 3951=>"They  are  the best  I  am  likely  to get  in  this beastly place," he muttered,  as he 
line 3952=>lay  down  beside  the  dwarves  and  tried  to  go  back  to  sleep  and  find  his  dream 
line 3953=>again.  But  that  was  not  the  last  of  the  lights  in  the  forest.  Later  when  the  night 
line 3954=>must  have  been  getting  old,  Kili  who  was  watching  then,  came  and  roused  them 
line 3955=>all again, saying: 
line 3956=>"There's a regular blaze of light begun not far away – hundreds of torches and 
line 3957=>many fires must have been lit suddenly and by magic. And hark to the singing and 
line 3958=>the harps!" 
line 3959=>After lying and listening for a while, they found they could not resist the desire 
line 3960=>to  go  nearer  and  try  once  more  to  get  help.  Up  they  got  again;  and  this  time  the 
line 3961=>result  was  disastrous.  The  feast  that  they  now  saw  was  greater  and  more 
line 3962=>magnificent  than before;  and  at  the head of  a  long  line of  feasters  sat  a woodland 
line 3963=>king  with  a  crown  of  leaves  upon  his  golden  hair,  very  much  as  Bombur  had 
line 3964=>described the figure in his dream. The elvish folk were passing bowls from hand to 
line 3965=>
line 3966=>####-hand  and  across  the  fires,  and  some  were  harping  and many  were  singing.  Their 
line 3967=>gloaming  hair  was  twined  with  flowers;  green  and  white  gems  glinted  on  their 
line 3968=>collars and their belts; and their faces and their songs were filled with mirth. Loud 
line 3969=>and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped Thorin into their midst. 
line 3970=>Dead  silence  fell  in  the middle of  a word. Out went  all  light. The  fires  leaped 
line 3971=>up  in  black  smokes.  Ashes  and  cinders  were  in  the  eyes  of  the  dwarves,  and  the 
line 3972=>wood  was  filled  again  with  their  clamour  and  their  cries.  Bilbo  found  himself 
line 3973=>running round and round (as he thought) and calling and calling: "Dori, Nori, Ori, 
line 3974=>Oin, Gloin, Fili, Kili, Bombur, Bifur, Bofur, Dwalin, Balin, Thorin Oakenshield," 
line 3975=>while people he could not see or  feel were doing  the same all  round him  (with an 
line 3976=>occasional "Bilbo!" thrown in). But the cries of the others got steadily further and 
line 3977=>fainter,  and  though  after  a while  it  seemed  to  him  they  changed  to  yells and cries 
line 3978=>for help  in  the  far distance, all noise at  last died  right away, and he was  left alone 
line 3979=>in complete silence and darkness. 
line 3980=> 
line 3981=>That was  one  of  his most miserable moments. But  he  soon made  up  his mind 
line 3982=>that  it was no good  trying  to do  anything  till  day came with some  little  light, and 
line 3983=>quite  useless  to  go  blundering  about  tiring  himself  out  with  no  hope  of  any 
line 3984=>breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself down with his back to a tree, and not for 
line 3985=>the  last  time  fell  to  thinking  of  his  far-distant  hobbit-hole  with  its  beautiful 
line 3986=>pantries. He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when he 
line 3987=>felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against his left 
line 3988=>hand,  and when  he  tried  to move  he  found  that  his  legs were  already wrapped  in 
line 3989=>the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over.  
line 3990=>Then  the great  spider, who had been busy  tying him up while he dozed, came 
line 3991=>from  behind  him  and  came  at  him.  He  could  only  see  the  things's  eyes,  but  he 
line 3992=>could  feel  its  hairy  legs  as  it  struggled  to wind  its  abominable  threads  round  and 
line 3993=>round him. It was lucky that he had come to his senses in time. Soon he would not 
line 3994=>have  been  able  to  move  at  all.  As  it  was,  he  had  a  desperate  fight  before  he  got 
line 3995=>free.  He  beat  the  creature  off  with  his  hands-it  was  trying  to  poison  him  to  keep 
line 3996=>him  quiet,  as  small  spiders  do  to  flies-until he  remembered his  sword  and drew  it 
line 3997=>out. Then the spider jumped back, and he had time to cut his legs loose. After that 
line 3998=>it was  his  turn  to  attack.  The  spider  evidently was  not  used  to  things  that carried 
line 3999=>such stings at  their sides, or  it would have hurried away quicker. Bilbo came at  it 
line 4000=>before  it  could  disappear  and  struck  it  with  his  sword  right  in  the  eyes.  Then  it 
line 4001=>went mad  and  leaped  and  danced  and  flung  out  its  legs  in  horrible  jerks, until he 
line 4002=>
line 4003=>####-killed it with another stroke; and then he fell down and remembered nothing more 
line 4004=>for a long while. 
line 4005=>There was  the usual dim grey  light of  the  forest-day about him when he came 
line 4006=>to  his  senses.  The  spider  lay  dead  beside  him,  and  his  sword-blade  was  stained 
line 4007=>black.  Somehow  the  killing  of  the  giant  spider,  all  alone  by  himself  in  the  dark 
line 4008=>without  the  help  of  the  wizard  or  the  dwarves  or  of  anyone  else,  made  a  great 
line 4009=>difference  to Mr. Baggins. He  felt a different person, and much  fiercer and bolder 
line 4010=>in  spite  of  an  empty  stomach,  as  he wiped  his  sword  on  the  grass  and  put  it  back 
line 4011=>into its sheath. 
line 4012=>"I will give you a name," he said to it, "and I shall call you Sting." 
line 4013=>After  that he  set out  to  explore. The  forest was grim  and  silent, but obviously 
line 4014=>he  had  first  of  all  to  look  for  his  friends,  who  were  not  likely  to  be  very  far  off, 
line 4015=>unless they had been made prisoners by the elves (or worse things). 
line 4016=>Bilbo  felt  that  it was unsafe  to  shout,  and he  stood  a  long while wondering  in 
line 4017=>what direction the path lay,  and in what direction he should go first to look for the 
line 4018=>dwarves.  "O!  why  did  we  not  remember  Beorn's  advice,  and  Gandalf's!"  he 
line 4019=>lamented.  "What  a mess we  are  in  now! We!  I  only wish  it was we:  it  is  horrible 
line 4020=>being all alone." 
line 4021=>In the end he made as good a guess as he could at the direction from which the 
line 4022=>cries for help had come in the night – and by luck (he was born with a good share 
line 4023=>of  it) be guessed more or  less  right, as you will  see. Having made up his mind he 
line 4024=>crept  along  as  cleverly  as  he  could.  Hobbits  are  clever  at quietness,  especially  in 
line 4025=>woods,  as  1.  have  already  told  you;  also  Bilbo  had  slipped  on  his  ring  before  he 
line 4026=>started. That is why the spiders neither saw nor heard him coming. 
line 4027=>He had picked his way stealthily 'for some distance, when he noticed a place of 
line 4028=>dense  black  shadow  ahead  of  him  black  even  for  that  forest,  like  a  patch  of 
line 4029=>midnight  that had never been cleared away. As he drew nearer, he saw  that  it was 
line 4030=>made  by  spider-webs one behind  and over  and  tangled with  another. Suddenly he 
line 4031=>saw,  too,  that  there  were  spiders  huge  and  horrible  sitting  in  the  branches  above 
line 4032=>him,  and  ring  or  no  ring  he  trembled  with  fear  lest  they  should  discover  him. 
line 4033=>Standing behind a tree he watched a group of them for some time, and then in the 
line 4034=>silence  and  stillness  of  the  wood  he  realised  that  these  loathsome  creatures  were 
line 4035=>speaking one to another. Their voices were a sort of thin creaking and hissing, but 
line 4036=>he could make out many of  the words  that  they said. They were  talking about  the 
line 4037=>dwarves! 
line 4038=>"It was  a  sharp  struggle, but worth  it,"  said one.  "What nasty  thick  skins  they 
line 4039=>have to be sure, but I'll wager there is good juice inside." 
line 4040=>
line 4041=>####-"Aye, they'll make fine eating, when they've hung a bit," said another.  
line 4042=>"Don't  hang  'em  too  long,"  said  a  third.  "They're  not  as  fat  as  they might  be. 
line 4043=>Been feeding none too well of late, I should guess." 
line 4044=>"Kill'em, I say," hissed a fourth; "kill 'em now and hang 'em dead for a while." 
line 4045=>"They're dead now, I'll warrant," said the first. 
line 4046=>"That they are not. I saw one a-struggling just now. Just coming round again, I 
line 4047=>should say, after a bee-autiful sleep. I'll show you." 
line 4048=>With that one of the fat spiders ran along a rope, till it came to a dozen bundles 
line 4049=>hanging  in  a  row  from  a  high  branch.  Bilbo  was  horrified,  now  that  he  noticed 
line 4050=>them for the first time dangling in the shadows, to see a dwarvish foot sticking out 
line 4051=>of  the bottoms of some of  the bundles, or here and  there  the  tip of a nose, or a bit 
line 4052=>of beard or of a hood. 
line 4053=>To the fattest of these bundles the spider went--"It is poor old Bombur, I'll bet," 
line 4054=>thought Bilbo  –  and  nipped  hard  at  the  nose  that  stuck  out. There was  a muffled 
line 4055=>yelp  inside,  and  a  toe  shot  up  and  kicked  the  spider  straight  and  hard. There was 
line 4056=>life  in  Bombur  still.  There  was  a  noise  like  the  kicking  of  a  flabby  football,  and 
line 4057=>the  enraged spider  fell off  the branch, only catching  itself with  its own  thread  just 
line 4058=>in time. 
line 4059=>The  others  laughed.  "You  were  quite  right,"  they  said,  "the  meat's  alive  and 
line 4060=>kicking!"                        " 
line 4061=>"I'll  soon  put  an  end  to  that,"  hissed  the  angry  spider  climbing  back  onto  the 
line 4062=>branch. 
line 4063=>Bilbo  saw  that  the moment  had  come  when  he must  do  something.  He  could 
line 4064=>not  get  up  at  the  brutes  and  he  had  nothing  to  shoot  with;  but  looking  about  he 
line 4065=>saw  that  in  this place  there were many  stones  lying  in what appeared  to be  a now 
line 4066=>dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and it did not take 
line 4067=>him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily.  
line 4068=>As  a  boy  he  used  to  practise  throwing  stones  at  things,  until  rabbits  and 
line 4069=>squirrels,  and even birds, got out of his way as quick as  lightning  if  they saw him 
line 4070=>stoop;  and  even  grownup  he  had  still  spent  a  deal  of  his  time  at  quoits,  dart-
line 4071=>throwing,  shooting  at  the  wand,  bowls,  ninepins  and  other  quiet  games  of  the 
line 4072=>aiming  and  throwing  sort-indeed  he  could  do  lots  of  things,  besides  blowing 
line 4073=>smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I haven't had time to tell you about. 
line 4074=>There  is  no  time  now.  While  he  was  picking  up  stones,  the  spider  had  reached 
line 4075=>Bombur,  and  soon  he  would  have  been  dead.  At  that  moment  Bilbo  threw.  The 
line 4076=>stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop 
line 4077=>to the ground, with all its legs curled up. 
line 4078=>
line 4079=>####-The  next  stone  went  whizzing  through  a  big  web,  snapping  its  cords,  and 
line 4080=>taking off the spider sitting in the middle of it, whack, dead. After that there was a 
line 4081=>deal  of  commotion  in  the  spider-colony,  and  they  forgot  the  dwarves  for  a  bit,  I 
line 4082=>can  tell  you.  They  could  not  see Bilbo,  but  they  could make  a  good  guess  at  the 
line 4083=>direction  from  which  the  stones  were  coming.  As  quick  as  lightning  they  came 
line 4084=>running  and  swinging  towards  the  hobbit,  flinging  out  their  long  threads  in  all 
line 4085=>directions,  till  the  air  seemed  full  of waving  snares. Bilbo,  however,  soon  slipped 
line 4086=>away to a different place. The idea came to him to lead the furious spiders further 
line 4087=>and further away from the dwarves, if he could; to make them curious, excited and 
line 4088=>angry  all  at  once. When  about  fifty  had  gone  off  to  the  place where  he  had  stood 
line 4089=>before, he threw some more stones at these, and at others that had stopped behind; 
line 4090=>then dancing among  the  trees he began  to  sing a  song  to  infuriate  them and bring 
line 4091=>them all after him, and also to let the dwarves hear his voice. 
line 4092=>This is what he sang: 
line 4093=> 
line 4094=>
line 4095=>Old fat spider spinning in a tree! 
line 4096=>Old fat spider can't see me! 
line 4097=>Attercop! Attercop! 
line 4098=>Won't you stop, 
line 4099=>Stop your spinning and look for me! 
line 4100=> 
line 4101=>Old Tomnoddy, all big body,  
line 4102=>Old Tomnoddy can't spy me! 
line 4103=>Attercop! Attercop! 
line 4104=>Down you drop! 
line 4105=>You'll never catch me up your tree! 
line 4106=>
line 4107=> 
line 4108=>Not very good perhaps, but then you must remember that he had to make it up 
line 4109=>himself, on  the  spur of  a very  awkward moment.  It did what he wanted  any way. 
line 4110=>As he  sang he  threw  some more  stones  and  stamped. Practically  all  the  spiders  in 
line 4111=>the  place  came  after  him:  some  dropped  to  the  ground,  others  raced  along  the 
line 4112=>branches, swung  from  tree  to  tree, or cast new  ropes across  the dark spaces. They 
line 4113=>made  for his noise  far quicker  than he had expected. They were  frightfully angry. 
line 4114=>Quite  apart  from  the  stones  no  spider  has  ever  liked  being  called  Attercop,  and 
line 4115=>Tomnoddy of course is insulting to anybody.  
line 4116=>Off  Bilbo  scuttled  to  a  fresh  place,  but  several  of  the  spiders  had  run  now  to 
line 4117=>different points in the glade where they lived, and were busy spinning webs across 
line 4118=>all  the  spaces  between  the  tree-stems.  Very  soon  the  hobbit would be  caught  in  a 
line 4119=>
line 4120=>####-thick fence of them all round him-that at least was the spiders' idea. Standing now 
line 4121=>in  the  middle  of  the  hunting  and  spinning  insects  Bilbo  plucked  up  his  courage 
line 4122=>and began a new song: 
line 4123=> 
line 4124=>
line 4125=>####-Lazy Lob and crazy Cob 
line 4126=>are weaving webs to wind me. 
line 4127=>I am far more sweet than other meat, 
line 4128=>but still they cannot find me! 
line 4129=> 
line 4130=>Here am I, naughty little fly; 
line 4131=>you are fat and lazy.  
line 4132=>You cannot trap me, though you try, 
line 4133=>in your cobwebs crazy.  
line 4134=>
line 4135=> 
line 4136=>With  that  he  turned  and  found  that  the  last  space  between  two  tall  trees  had 
line 4137=>been closed with a web-but luckily not a proper web, only great strands of double-
line 4138=>thick  spider-rope  run  hastily  backwards  and  forwards  from  trunk  to  trunk.  Out 
line 4139=>came his little' sword. He slashed the threads to pieces and went off singing. 
line 4140=>The spiders saw the sword, though I don't suppose they knew what it was, and 
line 4141=>at once the whole lot of them came hurrying after the hobbit along the ground and 
line 4142=>the branches, hairy legs waving, nippers and spinners snapping, eyes popping, full 
line 4143=>of froth and rage. They followed him into the forest until Bilbo had gone as far as 
line 4144=>he dared. 
line 4145=>Then quieter than a mouse he stole back. He had precious little time, he knew, 
line 4146=>before  the  spiders were disgusted and came back  to  their  trees where  the dwarves 
line 4147=>were hung. In the meanwhile he had to rescue them. The worst part of the job was 
line 4148=>getting up on to the long branch where the bundles were dangling. I don't suppose 
line 4149=>he would  have managed  it,  if  a  spider  had  not  luckily  left  a  rope  hanging  down; 
line 4150=>with  its  help,  though  it  stuck  to  his  hand  and  hurt  him,  he  scrambled  up-only  to 
line 4151=>meet  an old  slow wicked  fat-bodied spider who had remained behind to guard the 
line 4152=>prisoners, and had been busy pinching them to see which was the juiciest to eat. It 
line 4153=>had  thought of starting  the feast while  the others were away, but Mr. Baggins was 
line 4154=>in  a  hurry,  and  before  the  spider  knew  what  was  happening  it  felt  his  sting  and 
line 4155=>rolled off  the branch dead. Bilbo's next  job was  to  loose  a dwarf. What was he  to 
line 4156=>do?  If  he  cut  the  string  which  hung  him  up,  the  wretched  dwarf  would  tumble 
line 4157=>thump to the ground a good way below. Wriggling along the branch (which made 
line 4158=>all the poor dwarves dance and dangle like ripe fruit) he reached the first bundle. 
line 4159=>"Fili  or  Kili,"  he  thought  by  the  tip  of  a  blue  hood  sticking  out  at  the  top. 
line 4160=>"Most  likely Fili," he  thought by  the  tip of a  long nose poking out of  the winding 
line 4161=>threads. He managed by  leaning over  to cut most of  the strong sticky  threads  that 
line 4162=>bound  him  round,  and  then,  sure  enough, with  a  kick  and  a  struggle most  of  Fili 
line 4163=>emerged.  I  am  afraid  Bilbo  actually  laughed  at  the  sight  of  him  jerking  his  stiff 
line 4164=>
line 4165=>####-arms and  legs as he danced on  the  spider-string under his armpits, just like one of 
line 4166=>those funny toys bobbing on a wire. 
line 4167=>Somehow  or  other  Fili  was  got  on  to  the  branch,  and  then  he  did  his  best  to 
line 4168=>help  the hobbit,  although he was  feeling very  sick  and  ill  from  spider-poison, and 
line 4169=>from  hanging  most  of  the  night  and  the  next  day  wound  round  and  round  with 
line 4170=>only his nose to breathe through. It took him ages to get the beastly stuff out of his 
line 4171=>eyes and eyebrows, and as for his beard, he had to cut most of it off. Well, between 
line 4172=>them  they started  to haul up  first one dwarf and  then another and slash  them  free. 
line 4173=>None  of  them were  better  off  than  Fili,  and  some  of  them were worse.  Some  had 
line 4174=>hardly  been  able  to breathe  at  all  (long noses  are  sometimes useful you  see),  and 
line 4175=>some had been more poisoned. 
line 4176=>In  this  way  they  rescued  Kili,  Bifur,  Bofur,  Don  and  Nori.  Poor  old  Bombur 
line 4177=>was  so  exhausted-he was  the  fattest  and  had  been  constantly  pinched  and  poked-
line 4178=>that  he  just  rolled off  the branch  and  fell plop on  to  the ground,  fortunately on  to 
line 4179=>leaves,  and  lay  there.  But  there were  still  five  dwarves  hanging  at  the  end  of  the 
line 4180=>branch  when  the  spiders  began  to  come  back,  more  full  of  rage  than  ever.  Bilbo 
line 4181=>immediately  went  to  the  end  of  the  branch  nearest  the  tree-trunk  and  kept  back 
line 4182=>those that crawled up. He had taken off his ring when he rescued Fili and forgotten 
line 4183=>to put it on again, so now they all began to splutter and hiss: 
line 4184=>"Now  we  see  you,  you  nasty  little  creature!  We  will  eat  you  and  leave  your 
line 4185=>bones and skin hanging on a tree. Ugh! he's got a sting has he? Well, we'll get him 
line 4186=>all the same, and then we'll hang him head downwards for a day or two." 
line 4187=>While  this  was  going  on,  the  other  dwarves  were  working  at  the  rest  of  the 
line 4188=>captives,  and  cutting  at  the  threads  with  their  knives.  Soon  all  would  be  free, 
line 4189=>though  it  was  not  clear  what  would  happen  after  that.  The  spiders  had  caught 
line 4190=>them  pretty  easily  the  night  before,  but  that  had  been  unawares  and  in  the  dark. 
line 4191=>This time there looked like being a horrible battle. 
line 4192=>Suddenly  Bilbo  noticed  that  some  of  the  spiders  had  gathered  round  old 
line 4193=>Bombur on the floor, and had tied him up again and were dragging him away. He 
line 4194=>gave  a  shout  and  slashed  at  the  spiders  in  front  of  him.  They  quickly  gave way, 
line 4195=>and  he  scrambled  and  fell  down  the  tree  right  into  the  middle  of  those  on  the 
line 4196=>ground. His  little sword was something new  in  the way of stings for  them. How  it 
line 4197=>darted  to  and  fro!  It  shone with  delight  as  he  stabbed  at  them. Half  a  dozen were 
line 4198=>killed before the rest drew off and left Bombur to Bilbo. 
line 4199=>"Come  down! Come  down!"  he  shouted  to  the  dwarves  on  the  branch.  "Don't 
line 4200=>stay up  there and be netted!" For he saw spiders swarming up all  the neighboring 
line 4201=>trees, and crawling along the boughs above the heads of the dwarves. 
line 4202=>
line 4203=>####-Down the dwarves scrambled or jumped or dropped, eleven all in a heap, most 
line 4204=>of  them  very  shaky  and  little  use  on  their  legs. There  they were  at  last,  twelve  of 
line 4205=>them counting poor old Bombur, who was being propped up on either  side by his 
line 4206=>cousin Bifur, and his brother Bofur; and Bilbo was dancing about and waving his 
line 4207=>Sting;  and  hundreds  of  angry  spiders were  goggling  at  them  all  round  and  about 
line 4208=>and above. It looked pretty hopeless. 
line 4209=>Then  the  battle  began. Some  of  the  dwarves  had  knives,  and some had sticks, 
line 4210=>and  all  of  them  could  get  at  stones;  and  Bilbo  had  his  elvish  dagger.  Again  and 
line 4211=>again  the spiders were beaten off, and many of  them were killed. But  it could not 
line 4212=>go  on  for  long. Bilbo was  nearly  tired  out;  only  four  of  the  dwarves were  able to 
line 4213=>stand firmly, and soon they would all be overpowered like weary flies. Already the 
line 4214=>spiders were beginning to weave their webs all round them again from tree to tree. 
line 4215=>In the end Bilbo could think of no plan except to let the dwarves into the secret of 
line 4216=>his ring. He was rather sorry about it, but it could not be helped. 
line 4217=>"I  am  going  to  disappear,"  he  said.  "I  shall  draw  the  spiders  off,  if  I  can;  and 
line 4218=>you must keep  together  and make  in  the opposite direction. To  the  left  there,  that 
line 4219=>is more or less the way towards the place where we last saw the elf-fires." 
line 4220=>It was difficult to get them to understand, what with their dizzy heads, and the 
line 4221=>shouts, and the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones; but at last Bilbo felt 
line 4222=>he  could  delay  no  longer-the  spiders  were  drawing  their  circle  ever  closer.  He 
line 4223=>suddenly  slipped  on  his  ring,  and  to  the  great  astonishment  of  the  dwarves  he 
line 4224=>vanished. 
line 4225=>Soon  there  came  the  sound  of  "Lazy  Lob"  and  "Attercop"  from  among  the 
line 4226=>trees  away  on  the  right.  That  upset  the  spiders  greatly. They  stopped  advancing, 
line 4227=>and  some,  went  off  in  the  direction  of  the  voice.  "Attercop" made  them  so  angry 
line 4228=>that  they  lost  their wits. Then Balin, who had grasped Bilbo's plan better  than  the 
line 4229=>rest, led an attack. The dwarves huddled together in a knot, and sending a shower 
line 4230=>of  stones  they  drove  at  the  spiders  on  the  left,  and  burst  through  the  ring.  Away 
line 4231=>behind them now the shouting and singing suddenly stopped. 
line 4232=>Hoping  desperately  that Bilbo  had  not  been  caught  the  dwarves went  on. Not 
line 4233=>fast enough, though. They were sick and weary, and they could not go much better 
line 4234=>than a hobble and a wobble, though many of the spiders were close behind. Every 
line 4235=>now  and  then  they  had  to  turn  and  fight  the  creatures  that were  overtaking  them 
line 4236=>and  already  some  spiders  were  in  the  trees  above  them  and  throwing  down  their 
line 4237=>long clinging threads. 
line 4238=>Things  were  looking  pretty  bad  again,  when  suddenly  Bilbo  appeared  and 
line 4239=>charged into the astonished spiders unexpectedly from the side. 
line 4240=>
line 4241=>####-"Go  on!  Go  on!"  he  shouted.  "I  will  do  the  stinging!"  And  he did. He darted 
line 4242=>backwards  and  forwards,  slashing  at  spider-threads,  hacking  at  their  legs,  and 
line 4243=>stabbing  at  their  fat  bodies  if  they  came  too  near.  The  spiders  swelled  with  rage, 
line 4244=>and  spluttered  and  frothed,  and  hissed  out  horrible  curses;  but  they  had  become 
line 4245=>mortally afraid of Sting, and dared not come very near, now that it had come back. 
line 4246=>So curse as  they would,  their prey moved slowly but steadily away. It was a most 
line 4247=>terrible business, and seemed to take hours. But at last, just when Bilbo felt that he 
line 4248=>could  not  lift  his  hand  for  a  single  stroke  more,  the  spiders  suddenly  gave  it  up, 
line 4249=>and followed them no more, but went back disappointed to their dark colony.  
line 4250=>The  dwarves  then  noticed  that  they  had  come  to  the  edge  of  a  ring where  elf-
line 4251=>fires  had  been.  Whether  it  was  one  of  those  they  had  seen  the  night  before,  they 
line 4252=>could  not  tell. But  it  seemed  that  some  good magic  lingered  in  such  spots, which 
line 4253=>the spiders did not like. At any rate here the light was greener, and the boughs less 
line 4254=>thick and threatening, and they had a chance to rest and draw breath. 
line 4255=>There they lay for some time, puffing and panting. put very soon they began to 
line 4256=>ask questions. They had to have the whole vanishing business carefully explained, 
line 4257=>and  the  finding  of  the  ring  interested  them  so  much  that  for  a  while  they  forgot 
line 4258=>their own troubles. Balin in particular insisted on having the Gollum story, riddles 
line 4259=>and  all,  told  all  over  again, with  the  ring  in  its  proper  place. But  after  a  time  the 
line 4260=>light  began  to  fail,  and  then  other  questions  were  asked.  Where  were  they,  and 
line 4261=>where was their path, and where was there any food, and what were they going to 
line 4262=>do  next?  These  questions  they  asked  over  and  over  again,  and  it  was  from  little 
line 4263=>Bilbo  that  they seemed  to expect  to get  the answers. From which you can see  that 
line 4264=>they had changed their opinion of Mr. Baggins very much, and had begun to have 
line 4265=>a  great  respect  for  him  (as  Gandalf  had  said  they  would).  Indeed  they  really 
line 4266=>expected  him  to  think  of  some  wonderful  plan  for  helping  them,  and  were  not 
line 4267=>merely  grumbling.  They  knew  only  too  well  that  they  would  soon  all  have  been 
line 4268=>dead, if it had not been for the hobbit; and they thanked him many times. Some of 
line 4269=>them even got up and bowed right to the ground before him, though they fell over 
line 4270=>with  the  effort,  and  could  not  get  on  their  legs  again  for  some  time. Knowing  the 
line 4271=>truth about  the vanishing did not  lessen  their opinion of Bilbo at all;  for  they saw 
line 4272=>that  he  had  some  wits,  as  well  as  luck  and  a  magic  ring-and  all  three  are  very 
line 4273=>useful possessions. In fact they praised him so much that Bilbo began to feel there 
line 4274=>really  was  something  of  a  bold  adventurer  about  himself  after  all,  though  he  I 
line 4275=>would have felt a lot bolder still, if there had been anything to eat. 
line 4276=>But there was nothing, nothing at all; and none of them Were fit to go and look 
line 4277=>for  anything,  or  to  search  for  the  lost  path.  The  lost  path!  No  other  idea  would 
line 4278=>
line 4279=>####-come into Bilbo's tired head. He just sat staring in front of him at the endless trees; 
line 4280=>and  after  a while  they  all  fell  silent  again. All  except Balin. Long  after  the others 
line 4281=>had  stopped  talking  and  shut  their  eyes,  he  kept  on  muttering  and  chuckling  to 
line 4282=>himself. 
line 4283=>"Gollum! Well I'm blest! So that's how he sneaked past me is it? Now I know! 
line 4284=>Just  crept  quietly  along  did  you,  Mr.  Baggins?  Buttons  all  over  the  doorstep? 
line 4285=>Good  old  Bilbo-Bilbo-Bilbo-bo-bo-bo–"  And  then  he  fell  asleep,  and  there  was 
line 4286=>complete silence for a long time. 
line 4287=>All  of  a  sudden Dwalin  opened  an  eye,  and  looked  round  at  them.  "Where  is 
line 4288=>Thorin?"  he  asked.  It  was  a  terrible  shock.  Of  course  there  were  only  thirteen of 
line 4289=>them,  twelve dwarves and  the hobbit. Where  indeed was Thorin? They wondered 
line 4290=>what  evil  fate  had  befallen  him,  magic  or  dark  monsters;  and  shuddered  as  they 
line 4291=>lay  lost  in  the  forest. There  they dropped off one by one  into uncomfortable  sleep 
line 4292=>full  of  horrible  dreams,  as  evening wore  to  black  night;  and  there we must  leave 
line 4293=>them for the present, too sick and weary to set guards or take turns watching. 
line 4294=>Thorin  had  been  caught  much  faster  than  they  had.  You  remember  Bilbo 
line 4295=>falling  like  a  log  into  sleep,  as  he  stepped  into  a  circle  of  light?  The  next  time  it 
line 4296=>had  been  Thorin  who  stepped  forward,  and  as  the  lights  went  out  he  fell  like  a 
line 4297=>stone  enchanted.  All  the  noise  of  the  dwarves  lost  in  the  night,  their  cries  as  the 
line 4298=>spiders caught them and bound them, and all the sounds of the battle next day, had 
line 4299=>passed over him unheard. Then the Wood-elves had come to him, and bound him, 
line 4300=>and carried him away. The feasting people were Wood-elves, of course. These are 
line 4301=>not wicked folk. If they have a fault it is distrust of strangers. Though their magic 
line 4302=>was strong, even in those days they were wary. They differed from the High Elves 
line 4303=>of  the West,  and were more  dangerous  and  less wise.  For most  of  them  (together 
line 4304=>with  their  scattered  relations  in  the hills  and mountains) were  descended from the 
line 4305=>ancient  tribes  that never went  to Faerie  in  the West. There  the Light-elves and the 
line 4306=>Deep-elves  and  the  Sea-elves  went  and  lived  for  ages,  and  grew  fairer  and  wiser 
line 4307=>and more learned, and invented their magic and their cunning craft, in the making 
line 4308=>of  beautiful  and marvellous  things,  before  some  came  back  into  the Wide World. 
line 4309=>In  the Wide World  the Wood-elves  lingered  in  the  twilight of  our Sun  and Moon 
line 4310=>but  loved  best  the  stars;  and  they  wandered  in  the  great  forests  that  grew  tall  in 
line 4311=>lands  that  are  now  lost.  They  dwelt  most  often  by  the  edges  of  the  woods,  from 
line 4312=>which they could escape at times to hunt, or to ride and run over the open lands by 
line 4313=>moonlight or starlight; and after the coming of Men they took ever more and more 
line 4314=>to  the  gloaming  and  the  dusk. Still  elves  they were  and  remain,  and  that  is Good 
line 4315=>People. 
line 4316=>
line 4317=>####-In  a  great  cave  some  miles  within  the  edge  of  Mirkwood  on  its  eastern  side 
line 4318=>there  lived  at  this  time  their  greatest  king. Before  his  huge  doors  of  stone  a  river 
line 4319=>ran  out  of  the  heights  of  the  forest  and  flowed on  and out  into  the marshes  at  the 
line 4320=>feet of the high wooded lands. This great cave, from which countless smaller ones 
line 4321=>opened  out  on  every  side,  wound  far  underground  and  had  many  passages  and 
line 4322=>wide  halls;  but  it was  lighter  and more wholesome  than  any  goblin-dwelling, and 
line 4323=>neither so deep nor so dangerous. In fact the subjects of the king mostly lived and 
line 4324=>hunted  in  the  open  woods,  and  had  houses  or  huts  on  the  ground  and  in  the 
line 4325=>branches. The  beeches were  their  favourite  trees. The  king's  cave  was his palace, 
line 4326=>and  the  strong  place  of  his  treasure,  and  the  fortress  of  his  people  against  their 
line 4327=>enemies. 
line 4328=>It was  also  the  dungeon  of  his  prisoners.  So  to  the  cave  they  dragged Thorin-
line 4329=>not  too  gently,  for  they  did  not  love  dwarves,  and  thought  he  was  an  enemy.  In 
line 4330=>ancient days  they had had wars with some of  the dwarves, whom  they accused of 
line 4331=>stealing  their  treasure.  It  is  only  fair  to  say  that  the  dwarves  gave  a  different 
line 4332=>account, and said that they only took what was their due, for the elf-king had bar- 
line 4333=>gained with  them  to  shape  his  raw  gold  and  silver,  and  had  afterwards  refused  to 
line 4334=>give  them  their  pay.  If  the  elf-king had  a weakness  it was  for  treasure,  especially 
line 4335=>for  silver  and  white  gems;  and  though  his  hoard  was  rich,  he  was  ever  eager  for 
line 4336=>more, since he  had not yet  as great  a  treasure  as other  elf-lords of old. His people 
line 4337=>neither mined nor worked metals or jewels, nor did they bother much with trade or 
line 4338=>with  tilling  the  earth.  All  this  was  well  known  to  every  dwarf,  though  Thorin's 
line 4339=>family had had nothing  to do with the old quarrel I have spoken of. Consequently 
line 4340=>Thorin was angry at their treatment of him, when they took their spell off him and 
line 4341=>he came  to his senses; and also he was determined  that no word of gold or  jewels 
line 4342=>should be dragged out of him. 
line 4343=>The  king  looked  sternly  on  Thorin,  when  he  was  brought  before  him,  and 
line 4344=>asked him many questions. But Thorin would only say that he was starving. 
line 4345=>"Why  did  you  and  your  folk  three  times  try  to  attack  my  people  at  their 
line 4346=>merrymaking?" asked the king. 
line 4347=>"We  did  not  attack  them,"  answered  Thorin;  "we  came  to  beg,  because  we 
line 4348=>were starving." 
line 4349=>"Where are your friends now, and what are they doing?" 
line 4350=>"I don't know, but I expect starving in the forest." 
line 4351=>"What were you doing in the forest?" 
line 4352=>"Looking for food and drink, because we were starving." 
line 4353=>"But what brought you into the forest at all?" asked the king angrily.  
line 4354=>
line 4355=>####-At that Thorin shut his mouth and would not say another word. 
line 4356=>"Very well!"  said  the  king.  "Take  him  away  and  keep  him  safe,  until  he  feels 
line 4357=>inclined to tell the truth, even if he waits a hundred years.'" 
line 4358=>Then the elves put thongs on him, and shut him in one of the inmost caves with 
line 4359=>strong wooden doors, and left him. They gave him food and drink, plenty of both, 
line 4360=>if  not  very  fine;  for  Wood-elves  were  not  goblins,  and  were  reasonably  well-
line 4361=>behaved even  to  their worst enemies, when  they captured  them. The giant  spiders 
line 4362=>were the only living things that they had no mercy upon. 
line 4363=>There  in  the  king's  dungeon  poor  Thorin  lay;  and  after  he  had  got  over  his 
line 4364=>thankfulness  for bread  and meat and water, he began to wonder what had become 
line 4365=>of  his  unfortunate  friends.  It  was  not  very  long  before  he  discovered;  but  that 
line 4366=>belongs  to  the  next  chapter  and  the  beginning  of  another  adventure  in  which  the 
line 4367=>hobbit again showed his usefulness. 
line 4368=> 
line 4369=>
line 4370=>####-<h4>Chapter 9 </h4> <br> <br>
line 4371=>
line 4372=>Barrels Out of Bond 
line 4373=>
line 4374=> 
line 4375=>The day  after  the battle with  the  spiders Bilbo  and  the dwarves made one  last 
line 4376=>despairing effort  to find a way out before  they died of hunger and  thirst. They got 
line 4377=>up  and  staggered  on  in  the  direction  which  eight  out  of  the  thirteen  of  them 
line 4378=>guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out if they were 
line 4379=>right.  Such  day  as  there  ever  was  in  the  forest  was  fading  once  more  into  the 
line 4380=>blackness of night, when  suddenly out  sprang  the  light of many  torches  all  round 
line 4381=>them,  like  hundreds  of  red  stars.  Out  leaped  Wood-elves  with  their  bows  and 
line 4382=>spears and called the dwarves to halt. 
line 4383=>There  was  no  thought  of  a  fight.  Even  if  the  dwarves  had  not  been  in  such  a 
line 4384=>state  that  they  were  actually  glad  to  be  captured,  their  small  knives,  the  only 
line 4385=>weapons  they had, would have been of no use against  the arrows of  the elves  that 
line 4386=>could  hit  a  bird's  eye  in  the  dark. So  they  simply  stopped  dead  and  sat  down  and 
line 4387=>waited-all except Bilbo, who popped on his ring and slipped quickly to one side. 
line 4388=>That  is why, when  the  elves bound  the dwarves  in  a  long  line, one behind  the 
line 4389=>other,  and  counted  them,  they  never  found  or  counted  the  hobbit.  Nor  did  they 
line 4390=>hear  or  feel  him  trotting  along  well  behind  their  torch-light  as  they  led  off  their 
line 4391=>prisoners  into  the  forest.  Each  dwarf  was  blindfold,  but  that  did  not  make  much 
line 4392=>difference,  for  even Bilbo with  the  use  of  his  eyes  could  not  see where  they were 
line 4393=>going,  and  neither  he  nor  the  others  knew  where  they  had  started  from  anyway. 
line 4394=>Bilbo  had  all  he  could  do  to  keep  up with  the  torches,  for  the  elves were making 
line 4395=>the dwarves go  as  fast  as  ever  they  could,  sick  and weary  as  they were. The king 
line 4396=>had ordered them to make haste. Suddenly the torches stopped, and the hobbit had 
line 4397=>just  time  to  catch  them  up  before  they  began  to  cross  the  bridge.  This  was  the 
line 4398=>bridge  that  led  across  the  river  to  the  king's  doors.  The  water  flowed  dark  and 
line 4399=>swift and strong beneath; and at the far end were gates before the mouth of a huge 
line 4400=>cave  that  ran  into  the  side  of  a  steep  slope  covered  with  trees.  There  the  great 
line 4401=>beeches came right down to the bank, till their feet were in the stream. Across this 
line 4402=>bridge the elves thrust their prisoners, but Bilbo hesitated in the rear. He did not at 
line 4403=>all  like  the  look  of  the  cavern-mouth  and  he  only made  up  his mind  not  to desert 
line 4404=>his friends just in time to scuttle over at the heels of the fast elves, before the great 
line 4405=>gates of the king closed behind them with a clang. 
line 4406=>Inside  the  passages  were  lit  with  red  torch-light,  and  the  elf-guards  sang  as 
line 4407=>they marched along  the  twisting, crossing, and echoing paths. These were not like 
line 4408=>
line 4409=>####-those  of  the  goblin-cities:  they  were  smaller,  less  deep  underground,  and  filled 
line 4410=>with  a  cleaner  air.  In  a  great  hall with  pillars  hewn  out  of  the  living  stone  sat  the 
line 4411=>Elvenking on a chair of carven wood. On his head was a crown of berries and red 
line 4412=>leaves,  for  the  autumn  was  come  again.  In  the  spring  he  wore  a  crown  of 
line 4413=>woodland flowers. In his hand he held a carven staff of oak. 
line 4414=>The prisoners were brought before him; and though he looked grimly at them, 
line 4415=>he  told  his  men  to  unbind  them,  for  they  were  ragged  and  weary.  "Besides  they 
line 4416=>need no ropes in here," said he. "There is no escape from my magic doors for those 
line 4417=>who are once brought inside." 
line 4418=>Long and searchingly he questioned the dwarves about their doings, and where 
line 4419=>they were going to, and where they were coming from; but he got little more news 
line 4420=>out  of  them  than  out  of  Thorin.  They  were  surly  and  angry  and  did  not  even 
line 4421=>pretend to be polite. 
line 4422=>"What  have  we  done,  O  king?"  said  Balin,  who  was  the  eldest  left.  "Is  it  a 
line 4423=>crime  to  be  lost  in  the  forest,  to  be  hungry  and  thirsty,  to  be  trapped  by  spiders? 
line 4424=>Are  the  spiders your  tame beasts or your pets,  if killing  them makes you  angry?" 
line 4425=>Such a question of course made the king angrier than ever, and he answered: "It is 
line 4426=>a crime  to wander  in my  realm without  leave. Do you  forget  that you were  in my 
line 4427=>kingdom,  using  the  road  that  my  people  made?  Did  you  not  three  times  pursue 
line 4428=>and  trouble  my  people  in  the  forest  and  '  rouse  the  spiders  with  your  riot  and 
line 4429=>clamour?  After  all  the  disturbance  you  have  made  I  have  a  right  to  know  what 
line 4430=>brings you here, and if you will not tell me now, I will keep you all in prison until 
line 4431=>you have learned sense and manners!" 
line 4432=>Then he ordered  the dwarves  each  to be put  in  a  separate  cell  and  to be given 
line 4433=>food and drink, but not  to be allowed  to pass  the doors of  their  little prisons, until 
line 4434=>one at  least of  them was willing  to  tell him all he wanted  to know. But be did not 
line 4435=>tell  them  that  Thorin  was  also  a  prisoner  with  him.  It  was  Bilbo  who  found  that 
line 4436=>out. 
line 4437=> 
line 4438=>Poor  Mr.  Baggins  –  it  was  a  weary  long  time  that  he  lived  in  that  place  all 
line 4439=>alone,  and  always  in  hiding,  never  daring  to  take  off  his  ring,  hardly  daring  to 
line 4440=>sleep,  even  tucked  away  in  the  darkest  and  remotest  comers  he  could  find.  For 
line 4441=>something  to  do  he  took  to wandering  about  the  Elven-king's palace. Magic shut 
line 4442=>the  gates,  but  be  could  sometimes  get  out,  if  he  was  quick.  Companies  of  the 
line 4443=>Wood-elves,  sometimes with  the  king  at  their  head, would  from  time  to  time  ride 
line 4444=>out  to hunt, or  to other business  in  the woods and in the lands to the East. Then if 
line 4445=>Bilbo  was  very  nimble,  he  could  slip  out  just  behind  them;  though  it  was  a 
line 4446=>
line 4447=>####-dangerous  thing  to do. More  than once he was nearly caught  in  the doors, as  they 
line 4448=>clashed  together  when  the  last  elf  passed;  yet  he  did  not  dare  to  march  among 
line 4449=>them  because  of  his  shadow  (altogether  thin  and wobbly  as  it was  in  torch-light), 
line 4450=>or  for  fear  of  being  bumped  into  and  discovered. And when  he  did  go  out, which 
line 4451=>was  not  very  often,  he  did  no  good.  He  did  not  wish  to  desert  the  dwarves, and 
line 4452=>indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He could not keep 
line 4453=>up  with  the  hunting  elves  all  the  time  they  were  out,  so  he  never  discovered  the 
line 4454=>ways  out  of  the wood,  and was  left  to wander miserably  in  the  forest,  terrified  of 
line 4455=>losing  himself,  until  a  chance  came  of  returning. He was  hungry  too  outside,  for 
line 4456=>he was  no  hunter;  but  inside  the  caves  he  could  pick  up  a  living  of  some  sort  by 
line 4457=>stealing  food  from  store  or  table  when  no  one  was  at  hand.  "I  am  like  a  burglar 
line 4458=>that  can't  get  away,  but must  go  on miserably  burgling  the  same  house  day  after 
line 4459=>day,"  he  thought.  "This  is  the  dreariest  and  dullest  part  of  all  this  wretched, 
line 4460=>tiresome,  uncomfortable  adventure!  I  wish  I  was  back  in  my  hobbit-hole  by my 
line 4461=>own warm fireside with the lamp shining!" He often wished, too, that he could get 
line 4462=>a message for help sent to the wizard, but that of course was quite impossible; and 
line 4463=>he soon  realized  that  if anything was  to be done,  it would have  to be done by Mr. 
line 4464=>Baggins, alone and unaided. 
line 4465=>Eventually,  after  a week  or  two  of  this  sneaking  sort  of  life,  by watching  and 
line 4466=>following  the  guards  and  taking  what  chances  he  could,  he  managed  to  find  out 
line 4467=>where each dwarf was kept. He found all their twelve cells in different parts of the 
line 4468=>palace,  and  after  a  time  he  got  to  know  his  way  about  very  well.  What  was  his 
line 4469=>surprise one day to overhear some of the guards talking and to learn that there was 
line 4470=>another dwarf in prison too, in a specially deep dark place. He guessed at once, of 
line 4471=>course,  that  that was  Thorin;  and  after  a while he  found  that his guess was  right. 
line 4472=>At  last  after  many  difficulties  he  managed  to  find  the  place  when  no  one  was 
line 4473=>about, and to have a word with the chief of the dwarves. Thorin was too wretched 
line 4474=>to  be  angry  any  longer  at  his  misfortunes,  and  was  even  beginning  to  think  of 
line 4475=>telling the king all about his treasure and his quest (which shows how low-spirited 
line 4476=>he had become), when he heard Bilbo's little voice at his keyhole. He could hardly 
line 4477=>believe  his  ears.  Soon  however  he  made  up  his  mind  that  he  could  not  be 
line 4478=>mistaken, and he came  to  the door and had a  long whispered  talk with  the hobbit 
line 4479=>on the other side. 
line 4480=>So  it was  that Bilbo was  able  to  take  secretly Thorin's message  to  each of  the 
line 4481=>other  imprisoned  dwarves,  telling  them  that  Thorin  their  chief was  also  in prison 
line 4482=>close  at  hand,  and  that  no  one was  to  reveal  their  errand  to  the  long,  not  yet,  not 
line 4483=>before  Thorin  gave  the  word.  For  Thorin  had  taken  heart  again  hearing  how  the 
line 4484=>
line 4485=>####-hobbit  had  rescued  his  companions  from  the  spiders,  and  was  determined  once 
line 4486=>more  not  to  ransom  himself  with  promises  to  the  king  of  a  share  in  the  treasure, 
line 4487=>until  all  hope  of  escaping  in  any  other  way  had  disappeared;  until  in  fact  the 
line 4488=>remarkable Mr. Invisible Baggins (of whom he began to have a very high opinion 
line 4489=>indeed) had altogether failed to think of something clever.  
line 4490=>The  other  dwarves  quite  agreed when  they  got  the message. They  all  thought 
line 4491=>their  own  shares  in  the  treasure  (which  they  quite  regarded  as  theirs,  in  spite  of 
line 4492=>their plight  and  the  still unconquered dragon) would  suffer  seriously if the Wood-
line 4493=>elves  claimed  part  of  it,  and  they  all  trusted  Bilbo.  Just  what  Gandalf  had  said 
line 4494=>would  happen,  you  see.  Perhaps  that  war  part  of  his  reason  for  going  off  and 
line 4495=>leaving them. 
line 4496=>Bilbo,  however,  did  not  feel  nearly  so  hopeful  as  they  did.  He  did  not  like 
line 4497=>being depended on by everyone, and he wished he had the wizard at hand. But that 
line 4498=>was no use: probably all the dark distance of Mirkwood lay between them. He sat 
line 4499=>and  thought  and  thought,  until  his  head  nearly  burst,  but  no  bright  idea  would 
line 4500=>come. One  invisible  ring was  a  very  fine  thing,  but  it was  not much  good  among 
line 4501=>fourteen. But of course, as you have guessed, he did  rescue his  friends  in  the end, 
line 4502=>and  this  is  how  it  happened.  One  day,  nosing  and  wandering  about.  Bilbo 
line 4503=>discovered  a  very  interesting  thing:  the  great  gates  were  not  the  only  entrance  to 
line 4504=>the  caves.  A  stream  flowed  under  part  of  the  lowest  regions  of  the  palace,  and 
line 4505=>joined the Forest River some way further to the east, beyond the steep slope out of 
line 4506=>which  the  main  mouth  opened.  Where  this  underground watercourse  came  forth 
line 4507=>from the hillside there was a water-gate. There the rocky roof came down close to 
line 4508=>the surface of the stream, and from it a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed 
line 4509=>of  the  river  to  prevent  anyone  coming  in  or  out  that way. But  the  portcullis was 
line 4510=>often open,  for a good deal of  traffic went out and  in by  the water-gate. If anyone 
line 4511=>had come in that way, he would have found himself in a dark rough tunnel leading 
line 4512=>deep into the heart of the hill; but at one point where it  passed under the caves the 
line 4513=>roof  had  been  cut  away  and  covered  with  great  oaken  trapdoors.  These  opened 
line 4514=>upwards  into  the  king's  cellars.  There  stood  barrels,  and  barrels,  and  barrels;  for 
line 4515=>the Wood-elves, and especially their king, were very fond of wine, though no vines 
line 4516=>grew in those parts. The wine, and other goods, were brought from far away, from 
line 4517=>their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands. 
line 4518=>Hiding  behind  one  of  the  largest  barrels  Bilbo  discovered  the  trapdoors  and 
line 4519=>their  use,  and  lurking  there,  listening  to  the  talk of  the king's  servants, he  learned 
line 4520=>how the wine and other goods came up the rivers, or over land, to the Long Lake. 
line 4521=>It  seemed  a  town of Men  still  throve  there, built out on bridges  far  into  the water 
line 4522=>
line 4523=>####-as  a  protection  against  enemies  of  all  sorts,  and  especially  against  the  dragon  of 
line 4524=>the  Mountain.  From  Lake-town  the  barrels  were  brought  up  the  Forest  River. 
line 4525=>Often they were just tied together like big rafts and poled or rowed up the stream; 
line 4526=>sometimes they were loaded on to flat boats. 
line 4527=>When  the  barrels  were  empty  the  elves  cast  them  through  the  trapdoors, 
line 4528=>opened  the  water-gate,  and  out  the  barrels  floated  on  the  stream,  bobbing  along, 
line 4529=>until they were carried by the current to a place far down the river where the bank 
line 4530=>jutted  out,  near  to  the  very  eastern  edge  of Mirkwood. There  they were  collected 
line 4531=>and  tied  together  and  floated  back  to  Lake-town,  which  stood  close  to  the  point 
line 4532=>where the Forest River flowed into the Long Lake. 
line 4533=> 
line 4534=>For  some  time Bilbo  sat and  thought about  this water-gate, and wondered if it 
line 4535=>could  be  used  for  the  escape  of  his  friends,  and  at  last  he  had  the  desperate 
line 4536=>beginnings of a plan. 
line 4537=>The  evening meal had been  taken  to  the prisoners. The guards were  tramping 
line 4538=>away  down  the  passages  taking  the  torch-light  with  them  and  leaving  everything 
line 4539=>in  darkness.  Then  Bilbo  heard  the  king's  butler  bidding  the  chief  of  the  guards 
line 4540=>good-night. 
line 4541=>"Now come with me," he said, "and taste the new wine that has just come in. I 
line 4542=>shall be hard at work tonight clearing the cellars of the empty wood, so let us have 
line 4543=>a drink first to help the labour." 
line 4544=>"Very good," laughed the chief of the guards. "I'll taste with you, and see if it is 
line 4545=>fit for the king's table. There is a feast tonight and it would not do to send up poor 
line 4546=>stuff!" 
line 4547=> 
line 4548=>When  he  heard  this  Bilbo  was  all  in  a  flutter,  for  he  saw  that  luck  was  with 
line 4549=>him  and  he  had  a  chance  at  once  to  try  his  desperate  plan.  He  followed  the  two 
line 4550=>elves, until  they entered a small cellar and sat down at a  table on which  two  large 
line 4551=>flagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an unusual 
line 4552=>kind was with Bilbo  then.  It must be potent wine  to make a wood-elf drowsy; but 
line 4553=>this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, 
line 4554=>not  meant  for  his  soldiers  or  his  servants,  but  for  the  king's  feasts  only,  and  for 
line 4555=>smaller bowls, not for the butler's great flagons. 
line 4556=>Very soon the chief guard nodded his head, then he laid it on the table and fell 
line 4557=>fast asleep. The butler went on talking and laughing to himself for a while without 
line 4558=>seeming to notice, but soon his head too nodded to the table, and he fell asleep and 
line 4559=>snored  beside  his  friend.  Then  in  crept  the  hobbit.  Very  soon  the chief guard had 
line 4560=>
line 4561=>####-no  keys,  but Bilbo was  trotting  as  fast  as  he  could  along  the  passage  towards  the 
line 4562=>cells. The  great  bunch  seemed  very  heavy  to  his  arms,  and  his  heart was  often  in 
line 4563=>his  mouth,  in  spite  of  his  ring,  for  he  could  not  prevent  the  keys  from  making 
line 4564=>every now and then a loud clink and clank, which put him all in a tremble. 
line 4565=>First  he  unlocked  Balin's  door,  and  locked  it  again  carefully  as  soon  as  the 
line 4566=>dwarf was  outside. Balin was most  surprised,  as  you  can  imagine;  but  glad  as  he 
line 4567=>was  to  get  out  of  his  wearisome  little  stone  room,  he  wanted  to  stop  and  ask 
line 4568=>questions, and know what Bilbo was going to do, and all about it. 
line 4569=>"No  time  now!"  said  the  hobbit.  "You  must  follow  me!  We  must  all  keep 
line 4570=>together  and not  risk getting  separated. All of us must  escape or none,  and  this  is 
line 4571=>our  last  chance.  If  this  is  found out, goodness knows where  the king will put you 
line 4572=>next, with chains on your hands and feet  too, I expect. Don't argue,  there's a good 
line 4573=>fellow!" 
line 4574=>Then  off  he went  from  door  to  door,  until  his  following  had  grown  to  twelve-
line 4575=>none  of  them  any  too  nimble,  what  with  the  dark,  and  what  with  their  long 
line 4576=>imprisonment. Bilbo's heart thumped every time one of them bumped into another, 
line 4577=>or  grunted  or  whispered  in  the  dark.  "Drat  this  dwarvish  racket!"  he  said  to 
line 4578=>himself. But all went well, and they met no guards. As a matter of fact there was a 
line 4579=>great  autumn  feast  in  the woods  that night,  and  in  the halls  above. Nearly  all  the 
line 4580=>king's  folks  were  merrymaking.  At  last  after  much  blundering  they  came  to 
line 4581=>Thorin's  dungeon,  far  down  in  a  deep  place  and  fortunately  not  far  from  the 
line 4582=>cellars. 
line 4583=>"Upon my word!"  said Thorin, when Bilbo whispered to him to come out and 
line 4584=>join his  friends,  "Gandalf  spoke  true,  as usual. A pretty  fine burglar you make,  it 
line 4585=>seems,  when  the  time  comes.  I  am  sure  we  are  all  for  ever  at  your  service, 
line 4586=>whatever happens after this. But what comes next?" 
line 4587=>Bilbo saw that the time had come to explain his idea, as far as he could; but he 
line 4588=>did  not  feel  at  all  sure  bow  the  dwarves  would  take  it.  His  fears  were  quite 
line 4589=>justified, for they did not like it a bit, and started grumbling loudly in spite of their 
line 4590=>danger.  
line 4591=>"We  shall  be  bruised  and  battered  to  pieces,  and  drowned  too,  for  certain!" 
line 4592=>they muttered. "We thought you had got some sensible notion, when you managed 
line 4593=>to get hold of the keys. This is a mad idea!" 
line 4594=>"Very well!" said Bilbo very downcast, and also rather annoyed. "Come  along 
line 4595=>back  to  your  nice  cells,  and  I  will  lock  you  all  in  again,  and  you  can  sit  there 
line 4596=>comfortably  and  think  of  a  better  plan-but  I don't suppose  I shall ever get hold of 
line 4597=>the keys again, even if I feel inclined to try." 
line 4598=>
line 4599=>####-"That  was  too  much  for  them,  and  they  calmed  down.  In  the  end,  of  course, 
line 4600=>they had to do just what Bilbo suggested, because it was obviously impossible for 
line 4601=>them  to  try  and  find  their  way  into  the  upper  halls,  or  to  fight  their  way  out  of 
line 4602=>gates  that  closed  by  magic;  and  it  was  no  good  grumbling  in  the  passages  until 
line 4603=>they were caught again. So following the hobbit, down into the lowest cellars they 
line 4604=>crept.  They  passed  a  door  through which  the  chief  guard  and  the  butler  could  be 
line 4605=>seen  still  happily  snoring  with  smiles  upon  their  faces.  The  wine  of Dorwinion 
line 4606=>brings  deep  and  pleasant  dreams.  There  would  be  a  different  expression  on  the 
line 4607=>face of  the  chief guard next day,  even  though Bilbo, before  they went on,  stole  in 
line 4608=>and kindheartedly put the keys back on his belt. 
line 4609=>"That  will  save  him  some  of  the  trouble  he  is  in  for,"  said  Mr.  Baggins  to 
line 4610=>himself.  "He wasn't  a  bad  fellow,  and  quite  decent  to  the  prisoners.  It will  puzzle 
line 4611=>them all too. They will think we had a very strong magic to pass through all those 
line 4612=>locked doors and disappear. Disappear! We have got to get busy very quick, if that 
line 4613=>is to happen!" 
line 4614=> 
line 4615=>Balin was  told  off  to watch  the  guard  and  the  butler  and  give warning  if  they 
line 4616=>stirred. The rest went  into  the adjoining cellar with  the  trapdoors. There was  little 
line 4617=>time  to  lose.  Before  long,  as  Bilbo  knew,  some  elves were  under  orders  to  come 
line 4618=>down and help  the butler get  the empty barrels  through  the doors  into  the  stream. 
line 4619=>These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be 
line 4620=>pushed off. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they 
line 4621=>could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily 
line 4622=>be  secured  again.  But  among  them  were  several  others  which  had  been  used  for 
line 4623=>bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king's palace. 
line 4624=>They  soon  found  thirteen with  room enough  for a dwarf  in each.  In  fact  some 
line 4625=>were  too  roomy,  and  as  they  climbed  in  the  dwarves  thought  anxiously  of  the 
line 4626=>shaking and  the bumping  they would get  inside,  though Bilbo did his best  to  find 
line 4627=>straw  and  other  stuff  to  pack  them  in  as  cosily  as  could  be  managed  in  a  short 
line 4628=>time. At  last  twelve  dwarves were  stowed. Thorin  had  given  a  lot  of  trouble,  and 
line 4629=>turned  and  twisted  in  his  tub  and  grumbled  like  a  large  dog  in  a  small  kennel; 
line 4630=>while Balin, who came last, made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was 
line 4631=>stifling, even before his lid was on. Bilbo had done what he could to close holes in 
line 4632=>the  sides  of  the  barrels,  and  to  fix  on  all  the  lids  as  safely  as  could  be  managed, 
line 4633=>and  now  he  was  left  alone  again,  running  round  putting  the  finishing  touches-to 
line 4634=>the packing, and hoping against hope that his plan would come off. 
line 4635=>
line 4636=>####-It  had  not  been  a-bit too soon. Only a minute or two after Balin's lid had been 
line 4637=>fitted  on  there  came  the  sound  of  voices  and  the  flicker  of  lights.  A  number  of 
line 4638=>elves  came  laughing  and  talking  into  the  cellars  and  singing  snatches  of  song. 
line 4639=>They had  left a merry feast  in one of  the halls and were bent on returning as soon 
line 4640=>as  they  could.  "Where's  old  Galion,  the  butler?"  said  one.  "I  haven't  seen  him  at 
line 4641=>the tables tonight. He ought to be here now to show us what is to be done." 
line 4642=>"I shall be angry  if  the old slowcoach  is  late," said another. "I have no wish  to 
line 4643=>waste time down here while the song is up!" 
line 4644=>"Ha, ha!" came a cry. "Here's  the old villain with his head on a jug! He's been 
line 4645=>having a little feast all to himself and his friend the captain." 
line 4646=>"Shake him! Wake him!" shouted the others impatiently. Gallon was not at all 
line 4647=>pleased at being shaken or wakened, and still  less at being  laughed at.  "You're all 
line 4648=>late," he grumbled. "Here am I waiting and waiting down here, while you fellows 
line 4649=>drink  and  make  merry  and  forget  your  tasks.  Small  wonder  if  I  fall  asleep  from 
line 4650=>weariness!" 
line 4651=>"Small  wonder,"  said  they,  "when  the  explanation  stands  close  at  hand  in  a 
line 4652=>jug! Come  give  us  a  taste  of  your  sleeping-draught before we  fall  to! No need  to 
line 4653=>wake the turnkey yonder. He has had his share by the looks of it." 
line 4654=>Then  they  drank  once  round  and  became  mighty  merry  all  of  a  sudden.  But 
line 4655=>they did not quite  lose  their wits. "Save us, Galion!" cried some, "you began your 
line 4656=>feasting  early  and  muddled  your  wits!  You  have  stacked  some  full  casks  here 
line 4657=>instead of the empty ones, if there is anything in weight." 
line 4658=>"Get on with the work!" growled the butler. "There is nothing in the feeling of 
line 4659=>weight  in  an  idle  toss-pot's  arms. These  are  the ones  to go  and no others. Do  as  I 
line 4660=>say!" 
line 4661=>"Very  well,  very  well,"  they  answered  rolling  the  barrels  to  the  opening.  "On 
line 4662=>your  head  be  it,  if  the  king's  full  buttertubs  and  his  best  wine  is  pushed  into  the 
line 4663=>river for the Lake-men to feast on for nothing!" 
line 4664=> 
line 4665=>
line 4666=>Roll-roll-roll-roll, 
line 4667=>roll-roll-rolling down the hole I  
line 4668=>Heave ho! Splash plump ! 
line 4669=>Down they go, down they bump! 
line 4670=>
line 4671=> 
line 4672=>So  they  sang as  first one barrel and  then another  rumbled  to  the dark opening 
line 4673=>and  was  pushed  over  into  the  cold  water  some  feet  below.  Some  were  barrels 
line 4674=>really empty, some were  tubs neatly packed with a dwarf each; but down  they all 
line 4675=>went,  one  after  another, with many  a  clash  and  a  bump,  thudding  on  top  of  ones 
line 4676=>
line 4677=>####-below,  smacking  into  the water,  jostling against  the walls of  the  tunnel, knocking 
line 4678=>into one another, and bobbing away down the current. 
line 4679=>It was just at this moment that Bilbo suddenly discovered the weak point in his 
line 4680=>plan. Most  likely you  saw  it  some  time  ago  and have been  laughing  at him; but I 
line 4681=>don't suppose you would have done half as well yourselves in his place. Of course 
line 4682=>he was not  in a barrel himself, nor was  there anyone  to pack him  in, even  if  there 
line 4683=>had  been  a  chance!  It  looked  as  if  he  would  certainly  lose  his  friends  this  time 
line 4684=>(nearly  all  of  them  had  already  disappeared  through  the  dark  trap-door), and get 
line 4685=>utterly left behind and have to stay lurking as a permanent burglar in the elf-caves 
line 4686=>for ever. For even if he could have escaped through the upper gates at once, he had 
line 4687=>precious small chance of ever finding the dwarves again. He did not know the way 
line 4688=>by  land  to  the place where  the barrels were collected. He wondered what on earth 
line 4689=>would happen to them without him; for he had not had time to tell the dwarves all 
line 4690=>that  he  had  learned,  or what he had meant  to do, once  they were out of  the wood. 
line 4691=>While  all  these  thoughts  were  passing  through  his  mind,  the  elves  being  very 
line 4692=>merry  began  to  sing  a  song  round  the  river-door. Some had already gone  to haul 
line 4693=>on  the  ropes  which  pulled  up  the  portcullis  at  the  water-gate  so  as  to  let  out  the 
line 4694=>barrels as soon as they were all afloat below.  
line 4695=> 
line 4696=>
line 4697=>Down the swift dark stream you go 
line 4698=>Back to lands you once did know! 
line 4699=>Leave the halls and caverns deep, 
line 4700=>Leave the northern mountains steep, 
line 4701=>Where the forest wide and dim 
line 4702=>Stoops in shadow grey and grim! 
line 4703=>Float beyond the world of trees 
line 4704=>Out into the whispering breeze, 
line 4705=>Past the rushes, past the reeds, 
line 4706=>Past the marsh's waving weeds, 
line 4707=>Through the mist that riseth white 
line 4708=>Up from mere and pool at night! 
line 4709=>Follow, follow stars that leap 
line 4710=>Up the heavens cold and steep; 
line 4711=>Turn when dawn comes over land, 
line 4712=>Over rapid, over sand, 
line 4713=>South away! and South away! 
line 4714=>Seek the sunlight and the day,  
line 4715=>Back to pasture, back to mead, 
line 4716=>Where the kine and oxen feed! 
line 4717=>
line 4718=>####-Back to gardens on the hills 
line 4719=>Where the berry swells and fills 
line 4720=>Under sunlight, under day! 
line 4721=>South away! and South away! 
line 4722=>Down the swift dark stream you go 
line 4723=>Back to lands you once did know! 
line 4724=>
line 4725=> 
line 4726=>Now  the  very  last  barrel  was  being  rolled  to  the  doors!  In  despair  and  not 
line 4727=>knowing what  else  to  do,  poor  little Bilbo  caught hold of  it  and was pushed over 
line 4728=>the edge with it. Down into the water he fell, splash! into the cold dark water with 
line 4729=>the  barrel  on  top  of  him. He  came  up  again  spluttering  and  clinging  to  the wood 
line 4730=>like a  rat, but  for all his efforts he could not scramble on top. Every time he tried, 
line 4731=>the  barrel  rolled  round  and  ducked  him  under  again.  It  was  really  empty,  and 
line 4732=>floated light as a cork. Though his ears were full of water, he could hear the elves 
line 4733=>still  singing  in  the  cellar  above.  Then  suddenly  the  trapdoors  fell  to with a boom 
line 4734=>and  their  voices  faded  away. He was  in  the  dark  tunnel,  floating  in  icy water,  all 
line 4735=>alone-for you cannot count friends that are all packed up in barrels. 
line 4736=>Very  soon a grey patch came up  in  the darkness ahead. He heard  the creak of 
line 4737=>the water-gate being hauled up, and he found that he was in the midst of a bobbing 
line 4738=>and  bumping mass  of  casks  and  tubs  all  pressing  together  to  pass  under  the  arch 
line 4739=>and  get  out  into  the  open  stream.  He  had  as  much  as  he  could  do  to  prevent 
line 4740=>himself  from  being  hustled  and  battered  to  bits;  but  at  last  the  jostling  crowd 
line 4741=>began to break up and swing off, one by one, under the stone arch and away. Then 
line 4742=>he saw  that  it would have been no good even  if he had managed  to get astride his 
line 4743=>barrel,  for  there was  no  room  to  spare, not  even  for  a hobbit, between  its  top  and 
line 4744=>the suddenly stooping roof where the gate was. 
line 4745=> 
line 4746=>Out  they  went  under  the  overhanging  branches  of  the  trees  on  either  bank. 
line 4747=>Bilbo  wondered  what  the  dwarves  were  feeling  and  whether  a  lot  of  water  was 
line 4748=>getting  into  their  tubs.  Some  of  those  that  bobbed  along  by  him  in  the  gloom 
line 4749=>seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside. 
line 4750=>"I do hope  I put  the  lids on  tight enough!" he  thought, but before  long he was 
line 4751=>worrying  too much  about  himself  to remember  the dwarves. He managed  to keep 
line 4752=>his head  above  the water, but he was  shivering with  the  cold,  and he wondered  if 
line 4753=>he would die of  it before  the  luck  turned, and how much  longer he would be able 
line 4754=>to hang on, and whether he should risk the chance of  letting go and trying to swim 
line 4755=>to the bank. 
line 4756=>
line 4757=>####-The  luck  turned  all  right  before  long:  the  eddying  current  carried  several 
line 4758=>barrels  close  ashore  at  one  point  and  there  for  a  while  they  stuck  against  some 
line 4759=>hidden  root.  Then  Bilbo  took  the  opportunity  of  scrambling  up  the  side  of  his 
line 4760=>barrel while it was held steady against another. Up he crawled like a drowned rat, 
line 4761=>and lay on the top spread out to keep the balance as best he could. The breeze was 
line 4762=>cold  but  better  than  the water,  and  he  hoped  he would  not  suddenly  roll off again 
line 4763=>when  they  started  off  once  more.  Before  long  the  barrels  broke  free  again  and 
line 4764=>turned  and  twisted  off  down  the  stream,  and  out  into  the  main  current  Then  he 
line 4765=>found it quite as difficult to stick on as he had feared; but he managed it somehow, 
line 4766=>though  it was miserably uncomfortable. Luckily he was very  light, and  the barrel 
line 4767=>was  a  good  big  one  and  being  rather  leaky  had  now  shipped  a  small  amount  of 
line 4768=>water. All  the  same  it was  like  trying  to  ride, without  bridle  or  stirrups,  a  round-
line 4769=>bellied  pony  that  was  always  thinking  of  rolling  on  the  grass.  In  this  way  at  last 
line 4770=>Mr. Baggins came to a place where the trees on either hand grew thinner. He could 
line 4771=>see the paler sky between them. The dark river opened suddenly wide, and there it 
line 4772=>was  joined  to  the  main  water of  the Forest River  flowing down  in haste  from  the 
line 4773=>king's  great  doors.  There was  a  dim  sheet  of water  no  longer  overshadowed,  and 
line 4774=>on  its  sliding  surface  there were  dancing  and  broken  reflections  of  clouds  and  of 
line 4775=>stars. Then  the hurrying water of  the Forest River swept all the company of casks 
line 4776=>and tubs away to the north bank, in which it had eaten out a wide bay. This had a 
line 4777=>shingly  shore  under  hanging  banks  and  was  walled  at  the  eastern  end  by  a  little 
line 4778=>jutting  cape  of  hard  rock.  On  the  shallow  shore  most  of  the barrels  ran  aground, 
line 4779=>though a few went on to bump against the stony pier.  
line 4780=>There  were  people  on  the  look-out  on  the  banks.  They  quickly  poled  and 
line 4781=>pushed all the barrels together into the shallows, and when they had counted them 
line 4782=>they  roped  them  together and left them till the morning. Poor dwarves! Bilbo was 
line 4783=>not  so  badly  off  now.  He  slipped  from  his  barrel  and  waded  ashore,  and  then 
line 4784=>sneaked  along  to  some huts  that he  could  see near  the water's  edge. He no  longer 
line 4785=>thought  twice  about  picking  up  a  supper  uninvited  if  he  got  the  chance,  he  had 
line 4786=>been  obliged  to  do  it  for  so  long,  and  he  knew  only  too  well  what  it  was  to  be 
line 4787=>really  hungry,  not merely  politely  interested  in  the  dainties  of  a well-filled larder. 
line 4788=>Also he had caught a glimpse of a fire  through  the  trees, and that appealed to him 
line 4789=>with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.  
line 4790=> 
line 4791=>There is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night, for now we are 
line 4792=>drawing  near  the  end  of  the  eastward  journey  and  coming  to  the  last  and  greatest 
line 4793=>adventure,  so  we  must  hurry  on.  Of  course  helped  by  his  magic  ring  he  got  on 
line 4794=>
line 4795=>####-very well  at  first,  but  he was  given  away  in  the  end  by  his wet  footsteps  and  the 
line 4796=>trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he began to snivel, 
line 4797=>and  wherever  he  tried  to  hide  he  was  found  out  by  the  terrific  explosions  of  his 
line 4798=>suppressed  sneezes.  Very  soon  there  was  a  fine  commotion  in  the  village  by  the 
line 4799=>riverside; but Bilbo escaped  into  the woods carrying a  loaf and a  leather bottle of 
line 4800=>wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of the night he had to pass wet 
line 4801=>as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually 
line 4802=>dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was getting late and the air 
line 4803=>was chilly.  
line 4804=>He woke again with a specially loud sneeze. It was already grey morning, and 
line 4805=>there was a merry racket down by the river. They were making up a raft of barrels, 
line 4806=>and  the  raft-elves  would  soon  be  steering  it  off  down  the  stream  to  Lake-town. 
line 4807=>Bilbo  sneezed  again.  He  was  no  longer  dripping  but  he  felt  cold  all  over.  He 
line 4808=>scrambled down as  fast as his  stiff  legs would  take him and managed  just  in  time 
line 4809=>to get on to the mass of casks without being noticed in the general bustle. Luckily 
line 4810=>there was  no  sun  at  the  time  to  cast  an  awkward  shadow,  and  for  a mercy he did 
line 4811=>not sneeze again for a good while. 
line 4812=>There  was  a  mighty  pushing  of  poles.  The  elves  that  were  standing  in  the 
line 4813=>shallow  .water  heaved  and  shoved.  The  barrels  now  all  lashed  together  creaked 
line 4814=>and fretted.  . 
line 4815=>"This is a heavy load!" some grumbled. "They float too deep-some of these are 
line 4816=>never  empty.  If  they  had  come  ashore  in  the  daylight, we might  have  had  a  look 
line 4817=>inside," they said. 
line 4818=>"No time now!" cried the raftman. "Shove off!" 
line 4819=>And off they went at last, slowly at first, until they had passed the point of rock 
line 4820=>where other elves stood  to fend  them off with poles, and  then quicker and quicker 
line 4821=>as  they  caught  the  main  stream  and  went  sailing  away  down,  down  towards  the 
line 4822=>Lake. 
line 4823=>They  had  escaped  the  dungeons  of  the  king  and  were  through  the wood,  but 
line 4824=>whether alive or dead still remains to be seen. 
line 4825=> 
line 4826=>
line 4827=>####-<h4>Chapter 10</h4> <br> 
line 4828=>
line 4829=>A Warm Welcome 
line 4830=>
line 4831=> 
line 4832=>The day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the river 
line 4833=>rounded  a  steep  shoulder  of  land  that  came  down  upon  their  left. Under  its  rocky 
line 4834=>feet  like  an  inland  cliff  the  deepest  stream  had  flowed  lapping  and  bubbling. 
line 4835=>Suddenly  the  cliff  fell  away. The  shores  sank. The  trees  ended. Then Bilbo  saw  a 
line 4836=>sight: The  lands opened wide  about him,  filled with  the waters of  the  river which 
line 4837=>broke  up  and  wandered  in  a  hundred  winding  courses,  or  halted  in  marshes  and 
line 4838=>pools  dotted  with  isles  on  every  side:  but  still  a  strong  water  flowed  on  steadily 
line 4839=>through  the midst. And  far  away,  its  dark  head  in  a  torn  cloud,  there  loomed  the 
line 4840=>Mountain!  Its  nearest  neighbours  to  the  North-East  and  the  tumbled  land  that 
line 4841=>joined it to them could not be seen. All alone it rose and looked across the marshes 
line 4842=>to  the  forest.  The  Lonely  Mountain!  Bilbo  had  come  far  and  through  many 
line 4843=>adventures to see it, and now he did not like the look of it in the least. 
line 4844=>As  he  listened  to  the  talk  of  the  raftmen  and  pieced  together  the  scraps  of 
line 4845=>information  they  let  fall, he  soon  realized  that he was very  fortunate  ever  to have 
line 4846=>seen  it  at  all,  even  from  this  distance.  Dreary  as  had  been  his  imprisonment and 
line 4847=>unpleasant  as  was  his  position  (to  say  nothing  of  the  poor  dwarves  underneath 
line 4848=>him)  still,  he  had  been  more  lucky  than  he  had  guessed.  The  talk  was  all  of  the 
line 4849=>trade  that  came  and  went  on  the  waterways  and  the  growth  of  the  traffic  on  the 
line 4850=>river, as  the  roads out of  the East  towards Mirkwood vanished or  fell  into disuse; 
line 4851=>and of the bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood-elves about the upkeep of the 
line 4852=>Forest River and the care of the banks. 
line 4853=>Those  lands  had  changed  much  since  the  days  when  dwarves  dwelt  in  the 
line 4854=>Mountain,  days  which  most  people  now  remembered  only  as  a  very  shadowy 
line 4855=>tradition.  They  had  changed  even  in  recent  years,  and  since  the  last  news  that 
line 4856=>Gandalf  had  had  of  them.  Great  floods  and  rains  had  swollen  the  waters  that 
line 4857=>flowed  east;  and  there had been  an  earthquake or  two  (which  some were  inclined 
line 4858=>to attribute to the dragon-alluding to him chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod 
line 4859=>in  the  direction  of  the  Mountain).  The  marshes  and  bogs  had  spread  wider  and 
line 4860=>wider  on  either  side.  Paths  had  vanished,  and many  a  rider  and wanderer  too,  if 
line 4861=>they  had  tried  to  find  the  lost  ways  across.  The  elf-road  through  the wood which 
line 4862=>the dwarves had followed on the advice of Beorn now came to a doubtful and little 
line 4863=>used  end  at  the  eastern  edge  of  the  forest;  only  the  river offered any  longer a safe 
line 4864=>
line 4865=>####-way  from  the  skirts  of  Mirkwood  in  the  North  to  the  mountain-shadowed plains 
line 4866=>beyond, and the river was guarded by the Wood-elves' king. 
line 4867=>So  you  see Bilbo  had  come  in  the  end  by  the  only  road  that was  any  good.  It 
line 4868=>might have  been  some  comfort  to Mr. Baggins  shivering on  the barrels,  if he had 
line 4869=>known  that  news  of  this  had  reached  Gandalf  far  away  and  given  him  great 
line 4870=>anxiety, and  that he was  in  fact  finishing his other business  (which does not come 
line 4871=>into this tale) and getting ready to come in search of Thorin's company. But Bilbo 
line 4872=>did not know it. 
line 4873=>All he knew was that the river seemed to go on and on and on for ever, and he 
line 4874=>was  hungry,  and  had  a  nasty  cold  in  the  nose,  and  did  not  like  the  way  the 
line 4875=>Mountain seemed to frown at him and threaten him as it drew ever nearer. After a 
line 4876=>while, however,  the  river  took a more southerly course and  the Mountain  receded 
line 4877=>again,  and  at  last,  late  in  the  day  the  shores  grew  rocky,  the  river  gathered  all  its 
line 4878=>wandering  waters  together  into  a  deep  and  rapid  flood,  and  they  swept  along  at 
line 4879=>great speed. 
line 4880=>The  sun had  set when  turning with another  sweep  towards  the East  the  forest-
line 4881=>river  rushed  into  the  Long  Lake.  There  it  had  a  wide  mouth  with  stony  clifflike 
line 4882=>gates at either side whose feet were piled with shingles. The Long Lake! Bilbo had 
line 4883=>never  imagined  that  any  water  that  was  not  the  sea  could  look  so  big.  It  was  so 
line 4884=>wide  that  the  opposite  shores  looked  small  and  far,  but  it  was  so  long  that  its 
line 4885=>northerly end, which pointed towards the Mountain, could not be  seen at all. Only 
line 4886=>from the map did Bilbo know that away up there, where the stars of the Wain were 
line 4887=>already  twinkling,  the  Running  River  came  down  into  the  lake  from  Dale  and 
line 4888=>with  the  Forest  River  filled  with  deep  waters  what  must  once  have  been  a  great 
line 4889=>deep  rocky  valley. At  the  southern  end  the  doubled waters  poured  out  again  over 
line 4890=>high waterfalls  and  ran  away  hurriedly  to  unknown  lands.  In  the  still  evening  air 
line 4891=>the noise of the falls could be heard like a distant roar.  
line 4892=>Not  far  from  the mouth  of  the Forest River was the strange town he heard the 
line 4893=>elves speak of in the king's cellars. It was not built on the shore, though there were 
line 4894=>a  few  huts  and  buildings  there,  but  right  out  on  the  surface  of  the  lake,  protected 
line 4895=>from  the swirl of  the entering river by a promontory of rock which formed a calm 
line 4896=>bay. A great  . bridge made of wood ran out to where on huge piles made of forest 
line 4897=>trees  was  built  a  busy  wooden  town,  not  a  town  of  elves  but  of  Men,  who  still 
line 4898=>dared  to  dwell  here  under  the  shadow  of  the  distant  dragon-mountain. They  still 
line 4899=>throve  on  the  trade  that  came  up  the  great  river  from  the  South  and  was  carted 
line 4900=>past  the  falls  to  their  town;  but  in  the  great  days  of  old,  when  Dale  in  the  North 
line 4901=>was rich and prosperous, they had been wealthy and powerful, and there had been 
line 4902=>
line 4903=>####-fleets  of  boats  on  the  waters,  and  some  were  filled  with  gold  and  some  with 
line 4904=>warriors  in  armour,  and  there  had  been  wars  and  deeds  which  were  now  only  a 
line 4905=>legend.  The  rotting  piles  of  a  greater  town  could  still  be  seen  along  the  shores 
line 4906=>when the waters sank in a drought. 
line 4907=>But men  remembered  little of  all  that,  though  some  still  sang old  songs of  the 
line 4908=>dwarf-kings  of  the Mountain,  Thror  and  Thrain  of  the  race  of  Durin,  and  of  the 
line 4909=>coming of the Dragon, and the fall of the lords of Dale. Some sang too that Thror 
line 4910=>and Thrain would  come  back  one  day  and  gold would  flow  in  rivers  through  the 
line 4911=>mountain-gates, and all that land would be filled with new song and new laughter. 
line 4912=>But this pleasant legend did not much affect their daily business. 
line 4913=> 
line 4914=>As  soon  as  the  raft  of  barrels  came  in  sight boats  rowed out  from  the piles of 
line 4915=>the  town,  and  voices  hailed  the  raft-steerers. Then  ropes were  cast  and oars were 
line 4916=>pulled,  and  soon  the  raft  was  drawn  out  of  the  current  of  the  Forest  River  and 
line 4917=>towed  away  round  the  high  shoulder  of  rock  into  the  little  bay  of  Lake-town. 
line 4918=>There  it  was  moored  not  far  from  the  shoreward  head  of  the  great  bridge.  Soon 
line 4919=>men would come up  from  the South and  take  some of  the casks away, and others 
line 4920=>they would fill with goods they had brought to be taken back up the stream to the 
line 4921=>Wood-elves' home. In the meanwhile the barrels were left afloat while the elves of 
line 4922=>the raft and the boatmen went to feast in Lake-town. 
line 4923=>They would have been surprised, if they could have seen what happened down 
line 4924=>by  the  shore,  after  they  had  gone  and  the  shades  of  night  had  fallen. First  of  all  a 
line 4925=>barrel was  cut  loose  by Bilbo  and  pushed  to  the  shore  and  opened. Groans  came 
line 4926=>from  inside,  and  out  crept  a most  unhappy  dwarf. Wet  straw was  in  his  draggled 
line 4927=>beard;  he  was  so  sore  and  stiff,  so  bruised  and  buffeted  he  could  hardly  stand  or 
line 4928=>stumble through the shallow water to lie groaning on the shore. He had a famished 
line 4929=>and a savage look like a dog that has been chained and forgotten in a kennel for a 
line 4930=>week.  It was Thorin,  but  you  could  only  have  told  it  by his golden chain, and by 
line 4931=>the  colour  of  his  now  dirty  and  tattered  sky-blue  hood  with  its  tarnished  silver 
line 4932=>tassel. It was some time before he would be even polite to the hobbit. 
line 4933=>"Well,  are  you  alive  or  are  you  dead?"  asked  Bilbo  quite  crossly.  Perhaps  he 
line 4934=>had  forgotten  that he had had  at  least one good meal more  than  the dwarves,  and 
line 4935=>also  the use of his  arms  and  legs, not  to  speak of  a greater  allowance of  air.  "Are 
line 4936=>you still in prison, or are you free? If you want food, and if you want to go on with 
line 4937=>this silly adventure- it's yours after all and not mine-you had better slap your arms 
line 4938=>and rub your legs and try and help me get the others out while there is a chance!" 
line 4939=>
line 4940=>####-Thorin  of  course  saw  the  sense  of  this,  so  after  a  few  more  groans  he  got  up 
line 4941=>and  helped  the  hobbit as well as he could.  In  the darkness  floundering  in  the cold 
line 4942=>water  they had a difficult and very nasty  job  finding which were  the  right barrels. 
line 4943=>Knocking  outside  and  calling  only  discovered  about  six  dwarves  that  could 
line 4944=>answer.  They  were  unpacked  and  helped  ashore where  they  sat  or  lay muttering 
line 4945=>and  moaning;  they  were  so  soaked  and  bruised  and  cramped  that  they  could 
line 4946=>hardly yet realize their release or be properly thankful for it. 
line 4947=>Dwalin  and  Balin  were  two  of  the most  unhappy,  and  it  was  no  good  asking 
line 4948=>them  to  help.  Bifur  and  Bofur  were  less  knocked  about  and  drier,  but  they  lay 
line 4949=>down  and  would  do  nothing.  Fili  and  Kili,  however,  who  were  young  (for 
line 4950=>dwarves) and had also been packed more neatly with plenty of  straw  into  smaller 
line 4951=>casks, came out more or less smiling, with only a bruise or two and a stiffness that 
line 4952=>soon wore off. 
line 4953=>"I hope I never smell the smell of apples again!" said Fili. "My tub was full of 
line 4954=>it.  To  smell  apples  everlastingly  when  you  can  scarcely  move  and  are  cold  and 
line 4955=>sick  with  hunger  is  maddening.  I  could  eat  anything  in  the  wide  world  now,  for 
line 4956=>hours on end-but not an apple!" 
line 4957=>With  the willing help of Fili  and Kili, Thorin  and Bilbo  at  last discovered  the 
line 4958=>remainder  of  the  company  and  got  them  out.  Poor  fat  Bombur  was  asleep  or 
line 4959=>senseless; Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin and Gloin were waterlogged and seemed only half 
line 4960=>alive; they all had to be carried one by one and laid helpless on the shore. 
line 4961=>"Well! Here we are!" said Thorin. "And I suppose we ought to thank our stars 
line 4962=>and Mr. Baggins. I am sure he has a right to expect it, though I wish he could have 
line 4963=>arranged  a  more  comfortable  journey.  Still-all  very  much  at  your  service  once 
line 4964=>more, Mr. Baggins. No doubt we shall feel properly grateful, when we are fed and 
line 4965=>recovered. In the meanwhile what next?" 
line 4966=>"I suggest Lake-town," said Bilbo, "What else is there?" Nothing else could, of 
line 4967=>course, be suggested; so leaving the others Thorin and Fili and Kili and the hobbit 
line 4968=>went  along  the  shore  to  the  great  bridge. There were  guards  at  the  head  of  it,  but 
line 4969=>they were  not  keeping very careful watch,  for  it was  so  long  since  there had been 
line 4970=>any  real  need. Except  for  occasional  squabbles  about  river-tolls they were friends 
line 4971=>with the Wood-elves. Other folk were far away; and some of the younger people in 
line 4972=>the town openly doubted the existence of any dragon in the mountain, and laughed 
line 4973=>at  the greybeards and gammers who  said  that  they had  seen him  flying  in  the  sky 
line 4974=>in  their  young  days.  That  being  so  it  is  not  surprising  that  the  guards  were 
line 4975=>drinking  and  laughing  by  a  fire  in  their  hut,  and  did  not  hear  the  noise  of  the 
line 4976=>
line 4977=>####-unpacking  of  the  dwarves  or  the  footsteps  of  the  four  scouts.  Their  astonishment 
line 4978=>was enormous when Thorin Oakenshield stepped in through the door.  
line 4979=>"Who  are  you  and what  do  you want?"  they  shouted  leaping  to  their  feet  and 
line 4980=>gipping for weapons. 
line 4981=>"Thorin son of Thrain son of Thror King under the Mountain!" said the dwarf 
line 4982=>in  a  loud  voice,  and  he  looked  it,  in  spite  of  his  torn  clothes  and  draggled  hood. 
line 4983=>The  gold  gleamed  on  his  neck  and  waist:  his  eyes  were  dark  and  deep.  "I  have 
line 4984=>come back. I wish to see the Master of your town!" 
line 4985=>Then  there  was  tremendous  excitement.  Some  of  the  more  foolish  ran  out  of 
line 4986=>the  hut  as  if  they  expected  the  Mountain  to  go  golden  in  the  night  and  all  the 
line 4987=>waters  of  the  lake  to  turn  yellow  right  away.  The  captain  of  the  guard  came 
line 4988=>forward. 
line 4989=>"And who are these?" he asked, pointing to Fili and: Kili and Bilbo. 
line 4990=>"The sons of my father's daughter," answered Thorin, "Fili and Kili of the race 
line 4991=>of Durin, and Mr. Baggins who has travelled with us out of the West." 
line 4992=>"If you come in peace lay down your arms!" said the captain. 
line 4993=>"We  have  none,"  said  Thorin,  and  it  was  true  enough:  their  knives  had  been 
line 4994=>taken from them by the wood-elves, and the great sword Orcrist too. Bilbo had his 
line 4995=>short sword, hidden as usual, but he said nothing about that. "We have no need of 
line 4996=>weapons,  who  return  at  last  to  our  own  as  spoken  of  old.  Nor  could  we  fight 
line 4997=>against so many. Take us to your master!" 
line 4998=>"He is at feast," said the captain. 
line 4999=>"Then all the more reason for taking us to him," burst in Fili, who was getting 
line 5000=>impatient at these solemnities. "We are worn and famished after our long road and 
line 5001=>we have sick comrades. Now make haste and  let us have no more words, or your 
line 5002=>master may have something to say to you." 
line 5003=>"Follow me  then,"  said  the  captain,  and with  six men  about  them he  led  them 
line 5004=>over  the bridge  through  the gates and  into  the market-place of the town. This was 
line 5005=>a  wide  circle  of  quiet  water  surrounded  by  the  tall  piles  on  which  were  built  the 
line 5006=>greater  houses,  and  by  long  wooden  quays  with  many  steps  and  ladders  going 
line 5007=>down  to  the  surface  of  the  lake. From  one  great  hall  shone many  lights  and  there 
line 5008=>came  the  sound  of many  voices.  They  passed  its  doors  and  stood  blinking  in  the 
line 5009=>light looking at long tables filled with folk. 
line 5010=>"I  am Thorin  son  of Thrain  son of Thror King under the Mountain! I return!" 
line 5011=>cried Thorin in a loud voice from the door, before the captain could say anything. 
line 5012=>All  leaped  to  their  feet.  The Master  of  the  town  sprang  from  his  great  chair.  But 
line 5013=>
line 5014=>####-none  rose  in greater surprise  than  the  raft-men of the elves who were sitting at the 
line 5015=>lower end of the hall. Pressing forward before the Master's table they cried: 
line 5016=>"These  are  prisoners  of  our  king  that  have  escaped,  wandering  vagabond 
line 5017=>dwarves that could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through the 
line 5018=>woods and molesting our people!" 
line 5019=>"Is  this  true?"  asked  the  Master.  As  a  matter  of  fact  he  thought  it  far  more 
line 5020=>likely than the return of the King under the Mountain, if any such person had ever 
line 5021=>existed. 
line 5022=>"It  is  true  that we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elven-king and imprisoned 
line 5023=>without  cause  as  we  journeyed  back  to  our  own  land,"  answered  Thorin.  "But 
line 5024=>lock  nor  bar  may  hinder  the  homecoming  spoken  of  old.  Nor  is  this  town  in  the 
line 5025=>Wood-elves' realm. I speak to the Master of the town of the Men of the lake, not to 
line 5026=>the raft-men of the king." 
line 5027=>Then  the  Master  hesitated  and  looked  from  one  to  the  other.  The  Elvenking 
line 5028=>was  very  powerful  in  those  parts  and  the Master wished  for  no  enmity with  him, 
line 5029=>nor did he  think much of old songs, giving his mind  to  .trade and tolls, to cargoes 
line 5030=>and  gold,  to  which  habit  he  owed  his  position.  Others  were  of  different  mind, 
line 5031=>however,  and  quickly  the  matter  was  settled  without  him.  The  news  had  spread 
line 5032=>from  the  doors  of  the  hall  like  fire  through  all  the  town.  People  were  shouting 
line 5033=>inside  the  hall  and  outside  it. The  quays were  thronged with  hurrying  feet.  Some 
line 5034=>began  to  sing  snatches  of  old  songs  concerning  the  return  of  the  King  under  the 
line 5035=>Mountain;  that  it was Thror's grandson not Thror himself  that had come back did 
line 5036=>not bother them at all. Others took up the song and it rolled loud and high over the 
line 5037=>lake. 
line 5038=> 
line 5039=>
line 5040=>The King beneath the mountains, 
line 5041=>The King of carven stone, 
line 5042=>The lord of silver fountains 
line 5043=>Shall come into his own! 
line 5044=> 
line 5045=>His crown shall be upholden, 
line 5046=>His harp shall be restrung, 
line 5047=>His halls shall echo golden 
line 5048=>To songs of yore re-sung. 
line 5049=> 
line 5050=>The woods shall wave on mountains 
line 5051=>And grass beneath the sun; 
line 5052=>His wealth shall flow in fountains 
line 5053=>And the rivers golden run. 
line 5054=>
line 5055=>####- 
line 5056=>The streams shall run in gladness, 
line 5057=>The lakes shall shine and burn, 
line 5058=>And sorrow fail and sadness 
line 5059=>At the Mountain -king's return! 
line 5060=> 
line 5061=>So they sang, or very like that, only there was a great deal more of it, and there 
line 5062=>was much  shouting as well as  the music of harps and of  fiddles mixed up with  it. 
line 5063=>Indeed  such  excitement  had  not  been  known  in  the  town  in  the  memory  of  the 
line 5064=>oldest  grandfather. The Wood-elves  themselves began  to wonder greatly and even 
line 5065=>to  be  afraid.  They  did  not  know  of  course  how  Thorin  had  escaped,  and  they 
line 5066=>began to think their king might have made a serious mistake. As for the Master he 
line 5067=>saw  there was nothing else for  it but  to obey  the general clamour, for  the moment 
line 5068=>at any rate, and to pretend to believe that Thorin was what he said. So he gave up 
line 5069=>to  him  his  own  great  chair  and  set  Fili  and  Kili  beside  him  in  places  of  honour.  
line 5070=>Even  Bilbo  was  given  a  seat  at  the  high  table,  and  no  explanation  of  where  he 
line 5071=>came  in-no  songs  had  alluded  to  him  even  in  the  obscurest way-was asked  for  in 
line 5072=>the general bustle. 
line 5073=>Soon afterwards  the other dwarves were brought  into  the  town amid scenes of 
line 5074=>astonishing enthusiasm. They were all doctored and fed and housed and pampered 
line 5075=>in  the  most  delightful  and  satisfactory  fashion.  A  large  house  was  given  up  to 
line 5076=>Thorin  and  his  company;  boats  and  rowers were  put  at  their  service;  and  crowds 
line 5077=>sat outside and sang  songs all day, or cheered if any dwarf showed so much as his 
line 5078=>nose. 
line 5079=>Some of the songs were old ones; but some of them were quite new and spoke 
line 5080=>confidently  of  the  sudden  death  of  the  dragon  and  of  cargoes  of  rich  presents 
line 5081=>coming  down  the  river  to  Lake-town.  These were  inspired  largely  by  the Master 
line 5082=>and  they  did  not  particularly  please  the  dwarves,  but  in  the  meantime  they  were 
line 5083=>well  contented  and  they  quickly  grew  fat  and  strong  again.  Indeed within  a week 
line 5084=>they  were  quite  recovered,  fitted  out  in  fine  cloth  of  their  proper  colours,  with 
line 5085=>beards combed and trimmed, and proud steps. Thorin looked and walked as if his 
line 5086=>kingdom was already regained and Smaug chopped up into little pieces. 
line 5087=>Then,  as he had  said,  the dwarves' good  feeling  towards  the  little hobbit grew 
line 5088=>stronger  every  day.  There  were  no  more  groans  or  grumbles.  They  drank  his 
line 5089=>health, and they patted him on the back, and they made a great fuss of him; which 
line 5090=>was just as well, for he was not feeling particularly cheerful. He had not forgotten 
line 5091=>the  look  of  the  Mountain,  nor  the  thought  of  the  dragon,  and  he  had  besides  a 
line 5092=>
line 5093=>####-shocking  cold.  For  three  days  he  sneezed  and  coughed,  and  he  could  not  go  out, 
line 5094=>and even after that his speeches at banquets were limited to "Thag you very buch." 
line 5095=> 
line 5096=>In the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with their 
line 5097=>cargoes,  and  there  was  great  excitement  in  the  king's  palace.  I  have  never  heard 
line 5098=>what  happened  to  the  chief  of  the  guards  and  the  butler.  Nothing  of  course  was 
line 5099=>ever said about keys or barrels while  the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and Bilbo 
line 5100=>was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was 
line 5101=>known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In any case the 
line 5102=>king knew now the dwarves' errand, or thought he did, and he said to himself: 
line 5103=>"Very well! We'll see! No treasure will come back through Mirkwood without 
line 5104=>my having something to say in the matter. But I expect they will all come to a bad 
line 5105=>end, and serve them right!" He at any rate did not believe in dwarves fighting and 
line 5106=>killing  dragons  like  Smaug,  and  he  strongly  suspected  attempted  burglary  or 
line 5107=>something  like  it  which  shows  he  was  a  wise  elf  and  wiser  than  the  men  of  the 
line 5108=>town, though not quite right, as we shall see in the end. He sent out his spies about 
line 5109=>the  shores  of  the  lake  and  as  far northward  towards  the Mountains  as  they would 
line 5110=>go, and waited. 
line 5111=>At  the  end  of  a  fortnight  Thorin  began  to  think  of  departure.  While  the 
line 5112=>enthusiasm  still  lasted  in  the  town was  the  time  to get help.  It would not do  to  let 
line 5113=>everything  cool  down  with  delay.  So  he  spoke  to  the  Master  and  his  councillors 
line 5114=>and said that soon he and his company must go on towards the Mountain. 
line 5115=>Then for  the first  time  the Master was surprised and a  little frightened; and he 
line 5116=>wondered  if  Thorin  was  after  all  really  a  descendant  of  the  old  kings.  He  had 
line 5117=>never  thought  that  the  dwarves  would  actually  dare  to  approach  Smaug,  but 
line 5118=>believed  they were  frauds who would sooner or  later be discovered and be  turned 
line 5119=>out. He was wrong. Thorin, of  course, was  really  the grandson of  the King under 
line 5120=>the  Mountain,  and  there  is  no  knowing  what  a  dwarf  will  not  dare  and  do  for 
line 5121=>revenge or the recovery of his own. But the Master was not sorry at all to let them 
line 5122=>go.  They  were  expensive  to  keep,  and  their  arrival  had  turned  things  into  a  long 
line 5123=>holiday in which business was at a standstill. 
line 5124=>"Let them go and bother Smaug, and see how he welcomes them!" he thought. 
line 5125=>"Certainly,  O  Thorin  Thrain's  son  Thror's  son!"  was  what  he  said.  "You  must 
line 5126=>claim your own. The hour  is at hand, spoken of old. What help we can offer shall 
line 5127=>be yours, and we trust to your gratitude when your kingdom is regained." 
line 5128=>So  one  day,  although  autumn  was  now  getting  far  on,  and  winds  were  cold, 
line 5129=>and  leaves  were  falling  fast,  three  large  boats  left  Lake-town,  laden with  rowers, 
line 5130=>
line 5131=>####-dwarves,  Mr.  Baggins,  and  many  provisions.  Horses  and  ponies  had  been  sent 
line 5132=>round  by  circuitous  paths  to  meet  them  at  their  appointed  landing-place.  The 
line 5133=>Master  and  his  councillors  bade  them  farewell  from  the  great  steps  of  the  town-
line 5134=>hall  that  went  down  to  the  lake.  People  sang  on  the  quays  and  out  of  windows. 
line 5135=>The  white  oars  dipped  and  splashed,  and  off  they  went  north  up  the  lake  on  the 
line 5136=>last stage of their long journey. The only person thoroughly unhappy was Bilbo. 
line 5137=> 
line 5138=>
line 5139=>####-<h4>Chapter 11</h4> <br> 
line 5140=>
line 5141=>On the Doorstep 
line 5142=>
line 5143=> 
line 5144=>In  two  days  going  they  rowed  right up  the Long Lake and passed out  into  the 
line 5145=>River  Running,  and  now  they  could  all  see  the  Lonely  Mountain  towering  grim 
line 5146=>and  tall  before  them.  The  stream was  strong  and  their  going  slow. At  the;  end  of 
line 5147=>the third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or western bank and 
line 5148=>disembarked.  Here  they  were  joined  by  the  horses  with  other  provisions  and 
line 5149=>necessaries and the ponies for their own use that had been sent to meet them. They 
line 5150=>packed what  they  could  on  the  ponies  and  the  rest was made  into  a  store under  a 
line 5151=>tent,  but  none  of  the men  of  the  town would  stay with  them  even  for  the  night  so 
line 5152=>near the shadow of the Mountain. 
line 5153=>"Not  at  any  rate  until  the  songs  have  come  true!"  said  they.  It  was  easier  to 
line 5154=>believe in the Dragon and less easy to believe in Thorin in these wild parts. Indeed 
line 5155=>their stores had no need of any guard, for all  the  land was desolate and empty. So 
line 5156=>their escort  left  them, making off  swiftly down  the  river and  the  shoreward paths, 
line 5157=>although the night was already drawing on. 
line 5158=>They spent a cold and  lonely night and  their spirits  fell. The next day  they set 
line 5159=>out  again. Balin  and Bilbo  rode  behind,  each  leading  another  pony  heavily  laden 
line 5160=>beside  him;  the  others  were  some  way  ahead  picking  out  a  slow  road,  for  there 
line 5161=>were no paths. They made north-west, slanting away from the River Running, and 
line 5162=>drawing ever nearer and nearer to a great spur of the Mountain that was flung out 
line 5163=>southwards towards them. 
line 5164=>It was a weary journey, and a quiet and stealthy one. There was no laughter or 
line 5165=>song or sound of harps, and the pride and hopes which had stirred in their hearts at 
line 5166=>the  singing  of  old  songs  by  the  lake  died  away  to  a  plodding  gloom.  They  knew 
line 5167=>that they were drawing near to the end of their journey, and that it might be a very 
line 5168=>horrible end. The land about them grew bleak and barren, though once, as Thorin 
line 5169=>told  them,  it had been green and fair. There was  little grass, and before  long  there 
line 5170=>was neither bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones 
line 5171=>long  vanished.  They  were  come  to  the  Desolation  of  the  Dragon,  and  they  were 
line 5172=>come at the waning of the year.  
line 5173=> 
line 5174=>They  reached  the  skirts  of  the  Mountain  all  the  same  without  meeting  any 
line 5175=>danger or any sign of the Dragon other than the wilderness he had made about his 
line 5176=>lair.  The Mountain  lay  dark  and  silent  before  them  and  ever  higher  above  them. 
line 5177=>
line 5178=>####-They made  their  first  camp  on  the western  side  of  the  great  southern  spur, which 
line 5179=>ended  in  a  height  called Ravenhill. On  this  there  had  been  an  old watch-post; but 
line 5180=>they dared not climb it yet, it was too exposed. 
line 5181=>Before  setting  out  to  search  the western  spurs  of  the Mountain  for  the  hidden 
line 5182=>door, on which all their hopes rested, Thorin sent out a scouting expedition to spy 
line 5183=>out  the  land  to  the  South  where  the  Front  Gate  stood.  For  this  purpose  he  chose 
line 5184=>Balin  and Fili  and Kili,  and with  them went Bilbo. They marched under  the grey 
line 5185=>and silent cliffs to the feet of Ravenhill. There the river, after winding a wide loop 
line 5186=>over the valley of Dale, turned from the Mountain on its road to the Lake, flowing 
line 5187=>swift and noisily. Its bank was bare and rocky, tall and steep above the stream; and 
line 5188=>gazing  out  from  it  over  the  narrow  water,  foaming  and  splashing  among  many 
line 5189=>boulders,  they  could  see  in  the wide valley  shadowed by  the Mountain's  arms  the 
line 5190=>grey ruins of ancient houses, towers, and walls. 
line 5191=>"There  lies  all  that  is  left  of  Dale,"  said  Balin.  "The  mountain's  sides  were 
line 5192=>green with woods  and  all  the  sheltered  valley  rich  and  pleasant  in  the  days when 
line 5193=>the  bells  rang  in  that  town." He  looked  both  sad  and  grim  as  he  said  this: he had 
line 5194=>been one of Thorin's companions on the day the Dragon came. 
line 5195=>They did not dare to follow the river much further to. wards the Gate; but they 
line 5196=>went on beyond the end of the southern spur, until lying hidden behind a rock they 
line 5197=>could  look  out  and  see  the  dark  cavernous  opening  in  a  great  cliff-wall between 
line 5198=>the  arms  of  the Mountain. Out  of  it  the waters  of  the Running River  sprang;  and 
line 5199=>out  of  it  too  there  came  a  steam  and  a  dark  smoke. Nothing moved  in  the waste, 
line 5200=>save  the  vapour  and  the  water,  and  every  now  and  again  a  black  and  ominous 
line 5201=>crow. The only sound was  the sound of  the stony water, and every now and again 
line 5202=>the harsh croak of a bird. Balin shuddered. 
line 5203=>"Let us return!" he said. "We can do no good here!– And I don't like these dark 
line 5204=>birds, they look like spies of evil." 
line 5205=>"The dragon is still alive and in the halls under the Mountain then-or I imagine 
line 5206=>so from the smoke," said the hobbit. 
line 5207=>"That  does  not  prove  it,"  said Balin,  "though  I  don't  doubt  you  are  right. But 
line 5208=>he might be gone  away  some  time, or  he might be lying out on the mountain-side 
line 5209=>keeping watch, and still I expect smokes and steams would come out of the gates: 
line 5210=>all the halls within must be filled with his foul reek." 
line 5211=> 
line 5212=>With  such  gloomy  thoughts,  followed  ever  by  croaking  crows  above  them, 
line 5213=>they made  their weary way  back  to  the  camp. Only  in  June  they  had  been  guests 
line 5214=>in  the fair house of Elrond, and  though autumn was now crawling  towards winter 
line 5215=>
line 5216=>####-that  pleasant  time  now  seemed  years  ago.  They were  alone  in  the  perilous waste 
line 5217=>without  hope  of  further  help. They were  at  the  end  of  their  journey,  but  as  far  as 
line 5218=>ever, it seemed, from the end of their quest. None of them had much spirit left. 
line 5219=>Now  strange  to  say  Mr.  Baggins  had  more  than  the  others.  He  would  often 
line 5220=>borrow Thorin's map  and  gaze  at  it,  pondering over  the  runes and  the message of 
line 5221=>the  moon-letters  Elrond  had  read.  It  was  he  that  made  the  dwarves  begin  the 
line 5222=>dangerous  search  on  the  western  slopes  for  the  secret  door.  They  moved  their 
line 5223=>camp  then  to  a  long  valley,  narrower  than  the  great  dale  in  the  South where  the 
line 5224=>Gates  of  the  river  stood,  and  walled  with  lower  spurs  of  the  Mountain.  Two  of 
line 5225=>these  here  thrust  forward west  from  the main mass  in  long  steep-sided ridges  that 
line 5226=>fell ever downwards towards the plain. On this western side there were fewer signs 
line 5227=>of  the  dragon's  marauding  feet,  and  there  was  some  grass  for  their  ponies.  From 
line 5228=>this western  camp,  shadowed  all day by  cliff  and wall until  the  sun began  to  sink 
line 5229=>towards  the  forest,  day  by  day  they  toiled  in  parties  searching  for  paths  up  the 
line 5230=>mountain-side. If the map was true, somewhere high above the cliff at the valley's 
line 5231=>head must stand the secret door. Day by day they came back to their camp without 
line 5232=>success. 
line 5233=>But at  last unexpectedly  they  found what  they were seeking. Fili and Kili and 
line 5234=>the  hobbit went  back one day down  the valley and scrambled among  the  tumbled 
line 5235=>rocks  at  its  southern  corner.  About  midday,  creeping  behind  a  great  stone  that 
line 5236=>stood  alone  like  a  pillar,  Bilbo  came  on  what  looked  like  rough  steps  going 
line 5237=>upwards.  Following  these  excitedly  he  and  the dwarves  found  traces of  a narrow 
line 5238=>track,  often  lost,  often  rediscovered,  that  wandered  on  to  the  top  of  the  southern 
line 5239=>ridge and brought them at last to a still narrower ledge, which turned north across 
line 5240=>the  face of  the Mountain. Looking down  they  saw  that they were at the top of the 
line 5241=>cliff  at  the  valley's  head  and  were  gazing  down  on  to  their  own  camp  below. 
line 5242=>Silently, clinging to the rocky wall on their right, they went in single file along the 
line 5243=>ledge,  till  the  wall  opened  and  they  turned  into  a  little  steep-walled  bay,  grassy-
line 5244=>floored,  still  and quiet.  Its  entrance which  they had  found  could not be  seen  from 
line 5245=>below because of  the overhang of  the  cliff, nor  from  further off because  it was  so 
line 5246=>small that it looked like a dark crack and no more. It was not a cave and was open 
line 5247=>to  the  sky  above;  but  at  its  inner  end  a  flat  wall  rose  up  that  in  the  lower  I  part, 
line 5248=>close  to  the  ground,  was  as  smooth  and  upright  as  mason's  work,  but  without  a 
line 5249=>joint or crevice to be seen. 
line 5250=>"No sign was  there of post or  lintel or  threshold, nor any sign of bar or bolt or 
line 5251=>key-hole; yet they did not doubt that they had found the door at last. 
line 5252=>
line 5253=>####-They  beat  on  it,  they  thrust  and  pushed  at  it,  they  implored  it  to  move,  they 
line 5254=>spoke  fragments of broken  spells of opening, and nothing  stirred. At  last  tired out 
line 5255=>they.  rested  on  the  grass  at  its  feet,  and  then  at  evening  began,  their  long  climb 
line 5256=>down. 
line 5257=> 
line 5258=>There was excitement  in  the camp  that night.  In  the morning  they prepared  to 
line 5259=>move  once  more.  Only  Bofur  and  Bombur  were  left  behind  to  guard  the  ponies 
line 5260=>and  such  stores  as  they  had  brought  with  them  from  the  river.  The  others  went 
line 5261=>down  the  valley  and  up  the  newly  found  path,  and  so  to  the  narrow  ledge. Along 
line 5262=>this  they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was  it, with a 
line 5263=>fall  of  a  hundred  and  fifty  feet  beside  them  on  to  sharp  rocks  below;  but  each  of 
line 5264=>them  took a good coil of  rope wound  tight about his waist, and  so at  last without 
line 5265=>mishap they reached the little grassy bay.  
line 5266=>There  they  made  their  third  camp,  hauling  up  what  they  needed  from  below 
line 5267=>with  their ropes. Down  the same way  they were able occasionally  to  lower one of 
line 5268=>the more  active  dwarves,  such  as Kili,  to  exchange  such  news  as  there was,  or  to 
line 5269=>take  a  share  in  the  guard  below,  while  Bofur  was  hauled  up  to  the  higher  camp. 
line 5270=>Bombur would not come up either the rope or the path. 
line 5271=>"I am too fat for such fly-walks," he said. "I should turn dizzy and tread on my 
line 5272=>beard, and then you would be thirteen again. And the knotted ropes are too slender 
line 5273=>for my weight." Luckily for him that was not true, as you will see. 
line 5274=>In  the  meanwhile  some  of  them  explored  the  ledge  beyond  the  opening  and 
line 5275=>found a path  that  led higher and higher on  to  the mountain; but  they did not dare 
line 5276=>to venture very  far  that way, nor was  there much use  in  it. Out up  there  a  silence 
line 5277=>reigned,  broken  by  no  bird  or  sound  except  that  of  the  wind  in  the  crannies  of 
line 5278=>stone. They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every rock. 
line 5279=>The  others  who  were  busy  with  the  secret  of  the  door  had  no  more  success. 
line 5280=>They  were  too  eager  to  trouble  about  the  runes  or  the  moon-letters,  but  tried 
line 5281=>without  resting  to  discover where  exactly  in  the  smooth  face  of  the  rock  the  door 
line 5282=>was hidden. They had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Lake-town, and 
line 5283=>at  first  they  tried  to  use  these.  But  when  they  struck  the  stone  the  handles 
line 5284=>splintered and jarred their arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like lead. 
line 5285=>Mining work,  they  saw  clearly was  no  good  against  the magic  that  had  shut  this 
line 5286=>door; and they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise. 
line 5287=>Bilbo  found  sitting  on  the  doorstep  lonesome  and  wearisome-there was  not  a 
line 5288=>doorstep, of course, really, but they used to call the little grassy space between the 
line 5289=>wall  and  the  opening  the  "doorstep"  in  fun,  remembering Bilbo's words  long  ago 
line 5290=>
line 5291=>####-at  the  unexpected  party  in  his  hobbit-hole,  when  he  said  they  could  sit  on  the 
line 5292=>doorstep  till  they  thought  of  something.  And  sit  and  think  they  did,  or  wandered 
line 5293=>aimlessly about, and glummer and glummer they became. 
line 5294=>Their  spirits  had  risen  a  little  at  the  discovery  of  the path, but now  they  sank 
line 5295=>into their boots; and yet they would not give it up and go away. The hobbit was no 
line 5296=>longer much brighter than the dwarves. He would do nothing but sit with his back 
line 5297=>to  the  rock-face  and  stare  away west  through  the opening, over  the cliff, over  the 
line 5298=>wide  lands  to  the black wall of Mirkwood,  and  to  the distances beyond,  in which 
line 5299=>he  sometimes  thought  he  could  catch  glimpses  of  the Misty Mountains  small  and 
line 5300=>far. If the dwarves asked him what he was doing he answered: 
line 5301=>"You  said  sitting  on  the  doorstep  and  thinking  would  be  my  job,  not  to 
line 5302=>mention  getting  inside,  so  I  am  sitting  and  thinking." But  I  am  afraid  he was  not 
line 5303=>thinking  much  of  the  job,  but  of  what  lay  beyond  the  blue  distance,  the  quiet 
line 5304=>Western Land  and  the Hill  and  his  hobbit-hole under  it. A  large grey  stone  lay  in 
line 5305=>the centre of the grass and he stared moodily at it or watched the great snails. They 
line 5306=>seemed  to  love  the  little  shut-in  bay  with  its  walls  of  cool  rock,  and  there  were 
line 5307=>many of them of huge size crawling slowly and stickily along its sides. 
line 5308=>"Tomorrow begins the last week of Autumn," said Thorin one day.  
line 5309=>"And winter comes after autumn," said Bifur.  
line 5310=>"And  next  year  after  that,"  said  Dwalin,  "and  our  beards  will  grow  till  they 
line 5311=>hang  down  the  cliff  to  the  valley  before  anything  happens  here.  What  is  our 
line 5312=>burglar doing for us? 
line 5313=>Since  he  has  got  an  invisible  ring,  and  ought  to  be  a  specially  excellent 
line 5314=>performer  now,  I  am  beginning  to  think  he might  go  through  the  Front Gate  and 
line 5315=>spy things out a bit!" 
line 5316=>Bilbo  heard  this-the  dwarves  were  on  the  rocks  just  :  above  the  enclosure 
line 5317=>where  he  was  sitting-and  "Good Gracious!"  he  thought,  "so  that  is what  they  are 
line 5318=>beginning  to  think,  is  it?  It  is  always  poor  me  that  has  to  get  them  out  :  of  their 
line 5319=>difficulties, at least since the wizard left. Whatever am I going to do? I might have 
line 5320=>known  that  something  dreadful  would  happen  to  me  in  the  end.  I  don't  think  I 
line 5321=>could bear to see the unhappy valley of Dale again, and as for that steaming gate! 
line 5322=>! !" 
line 5323=>That  night  he  was  very  miserable  and  hardly  slept.  Next  day  the  dwarves  all 
line 5324=>went  wandering  off  in  various  directions;  some  were  exercising  the  ponies  down 
line 5325=>below,  some  were  roving  about  the  mountain-side. All day Bilbo  sat gloomily  in 
line 5326=>the  grassy  bay  gazing  at  the  stone,  or  out  west  through  the  narrow  opening. He 
line 5327=>
line 5328=>####-had  a  queer  feeling  that  he  was  waiting  for  something.  "Perhaps  the  wizard  will 
line 5329=>suddenly come back today," he thought. 
line 5330=>If  he  lifted  his  head  he  could  see  a  glimpse  of  the  distant  forest.  As  the  sun 
line 5331=>turned west there was a gleam of yellow upon its far roof, as if the light caught the 
line 5332=>last pale  leaves. Soon he  saw  the orange ball of  the  sun  sinking  towards  the  level 
line 5333=>of his eyes. He went  to  the opening and  there pale and faint was a  thin new moon 
line 5334=>above  the  rim  of Earth. At  that  very moment  he  heard  a  sharp crack behind him. 
line 5335=>There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush, nearly coal black, its 
line 5336=>pale  yellow  breast  freckled  dark  spots.  Crack!  It  had  caught  a  snail  and  was 
line 5337=>knocking it on the stone. Crack! Crack! 
line 5338=>Suddenly  Bilbo  understood.  Forgetting  all  danger  he  stood  on  the  ledge  and 
line 5339=>hailed  the  dwarves,  shouting  and  paying. Those  that were  nearest  came  tumbling 
line 5340=>over the rocks and as fast as they could along the ledge to him, wondering what on 
line 5341=>earth  was  the  matter;  the  others  shouted  to  be  hauled  up  the  ropes  (except 
line 5342=>Bombur, of course: he was asleep). 
line 5343=>Quickly  Bilbo  explained.  They  all  fell  silent:  the  hobbit  standing  by  the  grey 
line 5344=>stone,  and  the  dwarves with wagging  beards watching  impatiently.  The  sun  sank 
line 5345=>lower  and  lower,  and  their  hopes  fell.  It  sank  into  a  belt  of  reddened  cloud  and 
line 5346=>disappeared.  The  dwarves  groaned,  but  still  Bilbo  stood  almost  without  moving. 
line 5347=>The  little  moon  was  dipping  to  the  horizon.  Evening  was  coming  on.  Then 
line 5348=>suddenly  when  their  hope  was  lowest  a  red  ray  of  the  sun  escaped  like  a  finger 
line 5349=>through  a  rent  in  the  cloud.  A  gleam  of  light  came  straight  through  the  opening 
line 5350=>into  the  bay  and  fell  on  the  smooth  rock-face.  The  old  thrush,  who  had  been 
line 5351=>watching from a high perch with beady eyes and head cocked on one side, gave a 
line 5352=>sudden  trill. There was a  loud attack. A  flake of  rock split  from  the wall and  fell. 
line 5353=>A  hole  appeared  suddenly  about  three  feet  from  the  ground.  Quickly,  trembling 
line 5354=>lest the chance should fade, the dwarves rushed to the rock and pushed-in vain. 
line 5355=>"The key! The key!" cried Bilbo. "Where is Thorin?" 
line 5356=>Thorin hurried up. 
line 5357=>"The key!" shouted Bilbo. "The key that went with the map! Try it now while 
line 5358=>there is still time!" 
line 5359=>Then Thorin stepped up and drew the key on its chain from round his neck. He 
line 5360=>put  it  to  the  hole.  It  fitted  and it turned! Snap! The gleam went out, the sun sank, 
line 5361=>the moon was gone, and evening sprang into the sky.  
line 5362=>Now  they  all  pushed  together,  and  slowly  a  part  of  the  rock-wall  gave  way. 
line 5363=>Long straight cracks appeared and widened. A door five feet high and three broad 
line 5364=>was  out-  lined,  and  slowly  without  a  sound  swung  inwards.  It  seemed  as  if 
line 5365=>
line 5366=>####-darkness  flowed  out  like  a  vapour  from  the  hole  in  the  mountain-side,  and  deep 
line 5367=>darkness  in  which  nothing  could  be  seen  lay  before  their  eyes  mouth  leading  in 
line 5368=>and down. 
line 5369=> 
line 5370=>
line 5371=>####-<h4>Chapter 12</h4> <br> 
line 5372=>
line 5373=>Inside Information 
line 5374=>
line 5375=> 
line 5376=>For  a  long  time  the  dwarves  stood  in  the  dark  before  the  door  and  debated, 
line 5377=>until at last Thorin spoke: 
line 5378=>"Now  is  the  time  for  our  esteemed  Mr.  Baggins,  who  has  proved  himself  a 
line 5379=>good  companion  on  our  long  road,  and  a  hobbit  full  of  courage and  resource  far 
line 5380=>exceeding  his  size,  and  if  I may  say  so  possessed  of  good  luck  far  exceeding  the 
line 5381=>usual  allowance-now  is  the  time  for  him  to  perform  the  service  for which  he was 
line 5382=>included in our Company; now is the time for him to earn his Reward." 
line 5383=>You are  familiar with Thorin's style on  important occasions, so  I will not give 
line 5384=>you  any  more  of  it,  though  he  went  on  a  good  deal  longer  than  this.  It  certainly 
line 5385=>was an important occasion, but Bilbo felt impatient. By now he was quite familiar 
line 5386=>with Thorin too, and he knew what be was driving at. 
line 5387=>"If you mean you think it is my job to go into the secret passage first, O Thorin 
line 5388=>Thrain's son Oakenshield, may your beard grow ever longer," he said crossly, "say 
line 5389=>so  at  once  and  have  done!  I  might  refuse.  I  have  got  you  out  of  two  messes 
line 5390=>already,  which  were  hardly  in  the  original  bargain,  so  that  I  am,  I  think,  already 
line 5391=>owed  some  reward.  But  ‘third  time  pays  for  all'  as  my  father  used  to  say,  and 
line 5392=>somehow  I don't  think  I  shall  refuse. Perhaps  I have begun  to  trust my  luck more 
line 5393=>than I used to in the old days" – he meant last spring before he left his own house, 
line 5394=>but  it  seemed  centuries  ago  –  "but  anyway  I  think  I  will  go  and  have  a  peep  at 
line 5395=>once and get it over. Now who is coming with me?" 
line 5396=>He  did  not  expect  a  chorus  of  volunteers, so he was not disappointed. Fili and 
line 5397=>Kili  looked uncomfortable and stood on One  leg, but  the others made no pretence 
line 5398=>of offering  –  except  old Balin.  the  look-out man, who was  rather  fond  the hobbit. 
line 5399=>He  said  he would  come  inside  at  least  and  perhaps  a bit of  the way  too,  really  to 
line 5400=>call for help if necessary.  
line 5401=>The most  that  can  be  said  for  the  dwarves  is  this:  they  intended  to  pay  Bilbo 
line 5402=>really  handsomely  for  his  services;  they  had  brought  him  to  do  a  nasty  job  for 
line 5403=>them,  and  they  did  not  mind  the  poor  little  fellow  doing  it  if  he  would;  but  they 
line 5404=>would  all  have  done  their  best  to  get  him  out  of  trouble,  if  he  got  into  it,  as  they 
line 5405=>did in the case of the trolls at the beginning of their adventures before they had any 
line 5406=>particular  reasons  for  being  grateful  to  him.  There  it  is:  dwarves  are  not  heroes, 
line 5407=>but  calculating  folk with  a great  idea of  the value of money;  some  are  tricky  and 
line 5408=>
line 5409=>####-treacherous  and  pretty  bad  lots;  some  are  not,  but  are  decent  enough  people  like 
line 5410=>Thorin and Company, if you don't expect too much. 
line 5411=> 
line 5412=>The  stars  were  coming  out  behind  him  in  a  pale  sky  barred  with  black  when 
line 5413=>the hobbit crept through the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far 
line 5414=>easier going  than he  expected. This was no goblin  entrance, or  rough wood-elves' 
line 5415=>cave.  It  was  a  passage  made  by  dwarves,  at  the  height  of  their  wealth  and  skill: 
line 5416=>straight  as  a  ruler,  smooth-floored  and  smooth-sided,  going  with  a  gentle  never-
line 5417=>varying slope direct-to some distant end in the blackness below.  
line 5418=>After a while Balin bade Bilbo "Good  luck!" and  stopped where he could still 
line 5419=>see the faint outline of the door, and by a trick of, the echoes of the tunnel hear the 
line 5420=>rustle  of  the whispering  voices  of  the  others  just  outside. Then  the  hobbit  slipped 
line 5421=>on  his  ring,  and warned  by  the  echoes  to  take more  than hobbit's care to make no 
line 5422=>sound,  he  crept  noiselessly  down,  down,  down  into  the  dark.  He  was  trembling 
line 5423=>with  fear,  but  his  little  face  was  set  and  grim.  Already  he  was  a  very  different 
line 5424=>hobbit from the one that had run out without a pocket-handkerchief from Bag-End 
line 5425=>long  ago. He had not had  a pocket-handkerchief for ages. He loosened his dagger 
line 5426=>in its sheath, tightened his belt, and went on. 
line 5427=> 
line 5428=>"Now  you  are  in  for  it  at  last, Bilbo Baggins,"  he  said  to  himself.  "You went 
line 5429=>and put your foot right in it that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it 
line 5430=>out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was and am!" said the least Tookish part 
line 5431=>of  him.  "I  have  absolutely  no  use  for  dragon-guarded treasures, and the whole lot 
line 5432=>could  stay  here  for  ever,  if  only  I  could wake up and  find  this beastly  tunnel was 
line 5433=>my own front-hall at home!" 
line 5434=>He did not wake up of course, but went still on and on, till all sign of the door 
line 5435=>behind  had  faded  away.  He  was  altogether  alone.  Soon  he  thought  it  was 
line 5436=>beginning to feel warm. "Is that a kind of a glow I seem to see coming right ahead 
line 5437=>down  there?"  he  thought.  It was. As  he went  forward  it  grew  and  grew,  till  there 
line 5438=>was no doubt about it. It was a red light steadily getting redder and redder. Also it 
line 5439=>was  now  undoubtedly  hot  in  the  tunnel. Wisps of vapour  floated up and past him 
line 5440=>and he began to sweat. A sound, too, began to throb in his ears, a sort of bubbling 
line 5441=>like  the  noise  of  a  large  pot  galloping  on  the  fire,  mixed  with  a  rumble  as  of  a 
line 5442=>gigantic  tom-cat  purring.  This  grew  to  the  unmistakable  gurgling  noise  of  some 
line 5443=>vast animal snoring in its sleep down there in the red glow in front of him. 
line 5444=>  It  was  at  this  point  that  Bilbo  stopped.  Going  on  from  there  was  the  bravest 
line 5445=>thing he ever did. The tremendous things that happened afterward were as nothing 
line 5446=>
line 5447=>####-compared  to  it.  He  fought  the  real  battle  in  the  tunnel  alone,  before  he  ever  saw 
line 5448=>the vast danger that lay in wait. At any rate after a short halt go on he did; and you 
line 5449=>can picture him coming to the end of the tunnel, an opening of much the same size 
line 5450=>and shape as the door above. Through it peeps the hobbit's little head. Before him 
line 5451=>lies the great bottommost cellar or dungeon-hall of the ancient dwarves right at the 
line 5452=>Mountain's  root.  It  is  almost  dark  so  that  its  vastaess  can  only  be  dimly  guessed, 
line 5453=>but  rising  from  the near side of  the  rocky  floor  there  is a great glow. The glow of 
line 5454=>Smaug! 
line 5455=> 
line 5456=>There  he  lay,  a  vast  red-golden dragon, fast asleep;  thrumming came from his 
line 5457=>jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his  fires were  low  in slumber. Beneath 
line 5458=>him,  under  all  his  limbs  and  his  huge  coiled  tail,  and  about  him  on  all  sides 
line 5459=>stretching  away  across  the  unseen  floors,  lay  countless  piles  of  precious  things, 
line 5460=>gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy 
line 5461=>light. 
line 5462=>Smaug  lay, with wings  folded  like  an  immeasurable bat,  turned partly on one 
line 5463=>side,  so  that  the  hobbit  could  see  his  underparts  and  his  long  pale  belly  crusted 
line 5464=>with  gems  and  fragments  of  gold  from  his  long  lying  on  his  costly  bed.  Behind 
line 5465=>him  where  the  walls  were  nearest  could  dimly  be  seen  coats  of  mail,  helms  and 
line 5466=>axes,  swords  and  spears  hanging;  and  there  in  rows  stood  great  jars  and  vessels 
line 5467=>filled with a wealth that could not be guessed. To say that Bilbo's breath was taken 
line 5468=>away  is  no  description  at  all.  There  are  no words  left  to express his  staggerment, 
line 5469=>since Men changed the language that they learned of elves in the days when all the 
line 5470=>world was wonderful.  Bilbo  had  heard  tell  and  sing  of  dragon-hoards before, but 
line 5471=>the splendour, the lust, the glory of such treasure had never yet come home to him. 
line 5472=>His heart was filled and pierced with enchantment and with the desire of dwarves; 
line 5473=>and  he  gazed  motionless,  almost  forgetting  the  frightful  guardian,  at  the  gold 
line 5474=>beyond price and count. 
line 5475=> 
line 5476=>He  gazed  for  what  seemed  an  age,  before  drawn  almost  against  his  will,  he 
line 5477=>stole  from  the  shadow  of  the  doorway,  across  the  floor  to  the  nearest  edge  of  the 
line 5478=>mounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in his 
line 5479=>sleep.  He  grasped  a  great  two-handled  cup,  as  heavy  as  he  could  carry,  and  cast 
line 5480=>one  fearful  eye  upwards. Smaug  stirred  a wing,  opened  a  claw,  the  rumble  of  his 
line 5481=>snoring changed its note. 
line 5482=>Then  Bilbo  fled.  But  the  dragon  did  not  wake-not  yet  but  shifted  into  other 
line 5483=>dreams  of  greed  and  violence,  lying  there  in  his  stolen  hall while  the  little hobbit 
line 5484=>
line 5485=>####-toiled back up  the  long  tunnel. His heart was beating and a more  fevered shaking 
line 5486=>was in his legs than when he was going down, but still he clutched the cup, and his 
line 5487=>chief  thought was:  "I've  done  it! This will  show  them.  'More  like  a grocer  than  a 
line 5488=>burglar' indeed! Well, we'll hear no more of that." 
line 5489=>Nor did he. Balin was overjoyed to see the hobbit again, and as delighted as he 
line 5490=>was  surprised.  He  picked  Bilbo  up  and  carried  him  out  into  the  open  air.  It  was 
line 5491=>midnight  and  clouds  had  covered  the  stars,  but  Bilbo  lay  with  his  eyes  shut, 
line 5492=>gasping  and  taking pleasure  in  the  feel of  the  fresh  air  again,  and hardly noticing 
line 5493=>the  excitement  of  the  dwarves,  or  how  they  praised  him  and  patted  him  on  the 
line 5494=>back  and  put  themselves  and  all  their  families  for  generations  to  come  at  his 
line 5495=>service. 
line 5496=> 
line 5497=>The  dwarves  were  still  passing  the  cup  from  hand  to  hand  and  talking 
line 5498=>delightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke 
line 5499=>in  the mountain underneath as  if  it was an old volcano  that had made up its mind 
line 5500=>to  start  eruptions  once  again.  The  door  behind  them  was  pulled  nearly  to,  and 
line 5501=>blocked  from  closing  with  a  stone,  but  up  the  long  tunnel  came  the  dreadful 
line 5502=>echoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the 
line 5503=>ground beneath them tremble. 
line 5504=>Then  the  dwarves  forgot  their  joy  and  their  confident  boasts  of  a  moment 
line 5505=>before  and  cowered  down  in  fright.  Smaug was  still  to  be  reckoned with.  It  does 
line 5506=>not  do  to  leave  a  live  dragon  out  of  your  calculations,  if  you  live  near  him. 
line 5507=>Dragons may  not  have much  real  use  for  all  their wealth,  but  they  know  it  to  an 
line 5508=>ounce as a rule, especially after long possession; and Smaug was no exception. He 
line 5509=>had  passed  from  an  uneasy  dream  (in which  a warrior,  altogether  insignificant  in 
line 5510=>size  but  provided  with  a  bitter  sword  and  great  courage,  figured  most 
line 5511=>unpleasantly)  to  a  doze,  and  from  a  doze  to wide waking.  There was  a  breath  of 
line 5512=>strange  air  in  his  cave.  Could  there  be  a  draught  from  that  little  hole?  He  had 
line 5513=>never  felt  quite  happy  about  it,  though  was  so  small,  and  now  he  glared  at  it  in 
line 5514=>suspicion an wondered why he had never blocked it up. Of late he had half fancied 
line 5515=>he had caught the dim echoes of a knocking sound from far above that came down 
line 5516=>through  it  to  his  lair.  He  stirred  and  stretched  forth  his  neck  to  sniff.  Then  he 
line 5517=>missed the cup!                                       
line 5518=>Thieves!  Fire! Murder!  Such  a  thing  had  not  happened  since  first  he  came  to 
line 5519=>the Mountain! His rage passes description – the sort of rage that is only seen when 
line 5520=>rich  folk  that  have  more  than  they  can  enjoy  suddenly  lose  something  that  they 
line 5521=>have  long  had  but  have  never  before  used  or  wanted.  His  fire  belched  forth,  the 
line 5522=>
line 5523=>####-hall  smoked,  he  shook  the mountain-roots. He  thrust his head  in vain  at  the  little 
line 5524=>hole,  and  then  coiling  his  length  together,  roaring  like  thunder  underground,  he 
line 5525=>sped  from  his  deep  lair  through  its  great  door,  out  into  the  huge  passages  of  the 
line 5526=>mountain-palace and up towards the Front Gate. 
line 5527=>To  hunt  the  whole  mountain  till  he  had  caught  the  thief  and  had  torn  and 
line 5528=>trampled  him  was  his  one  thought.  He  issued  from  the  Gate,  the  waters  rose  in 
line 5529=>fierce  whistling  steam,  and  up  he  soared  blazing  into  the  air  and  settled  on  the 
line 5530=>mountain-top  in  a  spout of green  and  scarlet  flame. The dwarves heard  the  awful 
line 5531=>rumour  of  his  flight,  and  they  crouched  against  the  walls  of  the  grassy  terrace 
line 5532=>cringing  under  boulders,  hoping  somehow  to  escape  the  frightful  eyes  of  the 
line 5533=>hunting dragon. 
line 5534=>There they would have all been killed, if it had not been for Bilbo once again. 
line 5535=>"Quick! Quick!" he gasped. "The door! The tunnel! It's no good here." 
line 5536=>Roused  by  these  words  they  were  just  about  to  creep  inside  the  tunnel  when 
line 5537=>Bifur gave a cry: "My cousins! Bombur and Bofur – we have forgotten them, they 
line 5538=>are down in the valley!" 
line 5539=>"They will be slain, and all our ponies too, and all out stores lost," moaned the 
line 5540=>others. "We can do nothing." 
line 5541=>"Nonsense!"  said  Thorin,  recovering  his  dignity.  "We  cannot  leave  them.  Get 
line 5542=>inside Mr. Baggins and Balin, and you two Fili and Kili-the dragon shan't have all 
line 5543=>of us. Now you others, where are the ropes? Be quick!" 
line 5544=>Those  were  perhaps  the  worst  moments  they  had  been  through  yet.  The 
line 5545=>horrible sounds of Smaug's anger were echoing  in  the stony hollows  far above; at 
line 5546=>any  moment  he  might  come  blazing  down  or  fly  whirling  round  and  find  them 
line 5547=>there,  near  the  perilous  cliff's  edge  hauling  madly  on  the  ropes.  Up  came  Bofur, 
line 5548=>and  still  all  was  safe.  Up  came  Bombur,  puffing  and  blowing  while  the  ropes 
line 5549=>creaked, and still all was safe. Up came some tools and bundles of stores, and then 
line 5550=>danger was upon them. A whirring noise was heard. A red light touched the points 
line 5551=>of  standing  rocks.  The  dragon  came.  They  had  barely  time  to  fly  back  to  the 
line 5552=>tunnel, pulling and dragging in their bundles, when Smaug came hurtling from the 
line 5553=>North, licking the mountain-sides with flame, beating his great wings with a noise 
line 5554=>like a roaring wind. His hot breath shrivelled  the grass before  the door, and drove 
line 5555=>in  through  the  crack  they  had  left  and  scorched  them  as  they  lay  hid.  Flickering 
line 5556=>fires  leaped  up  and  black  rock-shadows  danced.  Then  darkness  fell  as  he  passed 
line 5557=>again. 
line 5558=>The ponies screamed with terror, burst their ropes and galloped wildly off. The 
line 5559=>dragon swooped and turned to pursue them, and was gone. 
line 5560=>
line 5561=>####-"That'll be the end of our poor beasts!" said Thorin. 
line 5562=>"Nothing  can  escape  Smaug  once  he  sees  it.  Here  we  are  and  here  we  shall 
line 5563=>have to stay, unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back to the river 
line 5564=>with Smaug on the watch!" 
line 5565=>It  was  not  a  pleasant  thought!  They  crept  further  down  the  tunnel,  and  there 
line 5566=>they  lay  and  shivered  though  it  was  warm  and  stuffy,  until  dawn  came  pale 
line 5567=>through  the  crack  of  the  door. Every  now  and  again  through  the  night  they  could 
line 5568=>hear the roar of the flying dragon grow and then pass and fade, as he hunted round 
line 5569=>and round the mountain-sides. 
line 5570=>He  guessed  from  the  ponies,  and  from  the  traces  of  the  camps  he  had 
line 5571=>discovered,  that men had  come up  from  the  river  and  the  lake  and had  scaled  the 
line 5572=>mountain-side  from  the  valley  where  the  ponies  had  been  standing;  but  the  door 
line 5573=>withstood his searching eye, and the little high-walled bay had kept out his fiercest 
line 5574=>flames.  Long  he  had  hunted  in  vain  till  the  dawn  chilled  his  wrath  and  he  went 
line 5575=>back to his golden couch to sleep – and to gather new strength. 
line 5576=>He would not  forget or  forgive  the  theft, not  if a  thousand years turned him to 
line 5577=>smouldering  stone,  but  he  could  afford  to  wait.  Slow  and  silent  he  crept  back  to 
line 5578=>his lair and half closed his eyes. 
line 5579=>When  morning  came  the  terror  of  the  dwarves  grew  less.  They  realized  that 
line 5580=>dangers  of  this  kind  were  inevitable  in  dealing  with  such  a  guardian,  and  that  it 
line 5581=>was  no  good  giving  up  their  quest  yet.  Nor  could  they  get  away  just  now,  as 
line 5582=>Thorin  had  pointed  out. Their  ponies were  lost  or  killed,  and  they would  have  to 
line 5583=>wait  some  time  before  Smaug  relaxed  his  watch  sufficiently  for  them  to dare  the 
line 5584=>long way on  foot. Luckily  they had  saved  enough of  their  stores  to  last  them  still 
line 5585=>for some time. 
line 5586=>They debated  long on what was  to be done, but  they could  think of no way of 
line 5587=>getting  rid  of  Smaug  –  which  had  always  been  a  weak  point  in  their  plans,  as 
line 5588=>Bilbo  felt  inclined  to  point  out.  Then  as  is  the  nature  of  folk  that  are  thoroughly 
line 5589=>perplexed,  they began  to grumble at  the hobbit, blaming him  for what had at  first 
line 5590=>so pleased them: for bringing away a cup and stirring up Smaug's wrath so soon. 
line 5591=>"What else do you suppose a burglar is to do?" asked Bilbo angrily. "I was not 
line 5592=>engaged  to  kill  dragons,  that  is  warrior's  work,  but  to  steal  treasure.  I  made  the 
line 5593=>best  beginning  I  could.  Did  you  expect  me  to  trot  back  with  the  whole  hoard  of 
line 5594=>Thror  on  my  back?  If  there  is  any  grumbling  to  be  done,  I  think  I  might  have  a 
line 5595=>say. You ought to have brought five hundred burglars not one. I am sure it reflects 
line 5596=>great  credit  on  your  grandfather,  but  you  cannot  pretend  that  you  ever  made  the 
line 5597=>
line 5598=>####-vast  extent  of  his  wealth  clear  to me.  I  should want  hundreds  of  years  to  bring  it 
line 5599=>all up, if I was fifty times as big, and Smaug as tame as a rabbit." 
line 5600=>After that of course the dwarves begged his pardon. 
line 5601=>"What  then  do  you  propose  we  should  do,  Mr.  Baggins?"  asked  Thorin 
line 5602=>politely.  
line 5603=>"I  have  no  idea  at  the  moment  –  if  you  mean  about  removing  the  treasure. 
line 5604=>That  obviously  depends  entirely  on  some  new  turn  of  luck  and  the  getting  rid  of 
line 5605=>Smaug. 
line 5606=>Getting  rid  of  dragons  is  not  at  all  in  my  line,  but  I  will  do  my  best  to  think 
line 5607=>about it. Personally I have no hopes at all, and wish I was safe back at home." 
line 5608=>"Never mind that for the moment! What are we to do now,  to-day?" 
line 5609=>"Well,  if  you  really want my  advice,  I  should  say we  can  do  nothing  but  stay 
line 5610=>where  we  are.  By  day  we  can  no  doubt  creep  out  safely  enough  to  take  the  air. 
line 5611=>Perhaps before long one or two could be chosen to go back to the store by the river 
line 5612=>and replenish our supplies. But in the meanwhile everyone ought to be well inside 
line 5613=>the tunnel by night. 
line 5614=>"Now  I  will  make  you  an  offer.  I  have  got my  ring  and will  creep  down  this 
line 5615=>very  noon-then  if  ever  Smaug  ought  to  be  napping-and  see  what  he  is  up  to. 
line 5616=>Perhaps something will turn up. 'Every worm has his weak spot,' as my father used 
line 5617=>to say, though I am sure it was not from personal experience." 
line 5618=>Naturally  the  dwarves  accepted  the  offer  eagerly.  Already  they  had  come  to 
line 5619=>respect little Bilbo. Now he had become the real leader in their adventure. He had 
line 5620=>begun  to  have  ideas  and  plans  of  his  own. When  midday  came  he  got  ready  for 
line 5621=>another  journey  down  into  the Mountain. He  did  not  like  it  of  course,  but  it was 
line 5622=>not  so  bad  now  he  knew, more  or  less, what was  in  front  of  him. Had  he  known 
line 5623=>more about dragons and  their wily ways, he might have  teen more  frightened and 
line 5624=>less hopeful of catching this one napping. 
line 5625=>The sun was shining when he started, but it was as dark as night in the tunnel. 
line 5626=>The light from the door, almost closed, soon faded as he went down. So silent was 
line 5627=>his going  that smoke on a gentle wind could hardly have surpasses  it, and he was 
line 5628=>inclined  to  feel  a  bit  proud  of  himself  as  he  drew  near  the  lower  door. There was 
line 5629=>only the very fainter glow to be seen. 
line 5630=>"Old Smaug  is weary and asleep," he  thought.  "He can't,  see me and he won't 
line 5631=>hear  me.  Cheer  up  Bilbo!"  He  had  forgotten  or  had  never  heard  about  dragons' 
line 5632=>sense of smell. 
line 5633=>It is also an awkward fact that they keep half an eye open watching while they 
line 5634=>sleep,  if  they are  suspicious. Smaug certainly  looked  fast asleep, almost dead and 
line 5635=>
line 5636=>####-dark, with scarcely a snore more than a whiff of unseen steam, when Bilbo peeped 
line 5637=>once more from the entrance. He was just about to step out on to the floor when he 
line 5638=>caught  a  sudden  thin  and  piercing  ray  of  red  from  under  the  drooping  lid.  of 
line 5639=>Smaug's  left  eye.  He  was  only  pretending  to  sleep!  He  was  watching  the  tunnel 
line 5640=>entrance!  Hurriedly  Bilbo  stepped  back  and  blessed  the  luck  of  his  ring.  Then 
line 5641=>Smaug spoke. 
line 5642=> 
line 5643=>"Well,  thief!  I  smell  you  and  I  feel  your  air.  I  hear  your  breath. Come  along! 
line 5644=>Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!" 
line 5645=>But Bilbo was  not  quite  so  unlearned  in  dragon-lore as all  that, and  if Smaug 
line 5646=>hoped to get him to come nearer so easily he was disappointed. 
line 5647=>"No  thank  you,  O  Smaug  the.  Tremendous!"  he  replied.  "I  did  not  come  for 
line 5648=>presents. I only wished  to have a  look at you and see  if you were  truly as great as 
line 5649=>tales say. I did not believe them." 
line 5650=>"Do  you  now?"  said  the  dragon  somewhat  flattered,  even  though  he  did  not 
line 5651=>believe a word of it.                   j 
line 5652=>"Truly  songs  and  tales  fall  utterly  short  of  the  reality,  O  Smaug  the  Chiefest 
line 5653=>and Greatest of Calamities," replied Bilbo.                                               I 
line 5654=>You  have  nice  manners  for  a  thief  and  a  liar,"  said  the  dragon.  "You  seem 
line 5655=>familiar with my  name,  but  I  don't  seem  to  remember  smelling  you  before. Who 
line 5656=>are you and where do you come from, may I ask?" 
line 5657=>"You  may  indeed!  I  come  from  under  the  hill,  and  under  hills  and  over  the 
line 5658=>hills my paths led. And through the air, I am he that walks unseen." 
line 5659=>"So I can well believe," said Smaug, "but that is hardly our usual name." 
line 5660=>"I am  the clue-finder, the web-cutter, the stinging fly. I as chosen for the lucky 
line 5661=>number." 
line 5662=>"Lovely  titles!"  sneered  the  dragon.  "But  lucky  numbers  don't  always  come 
line 5663=>off." 
line 5664=>"I  am  he  that  buries  his  friends  alive  and  drowns  them  and  draws  them  alive 
line 5665=>again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me." 
line 5666=>"These don't sound so creditable," scoffed Smaug. 
line 5667=>"I  am  the  friend  of  bears  and  the  guest  of  eagles.  I  am  Ringwinner  and 
line 5668=>Luckwearer;  and  I  am  Barrel-rider," went  on Bilbo  beginning  to  be  pleased with 
line 5669=>his riddling. 
line 5670=>"That's  better!"  said  Smaug.  "But  don't  let  your  imagination  run  away  with 
line 5671=>you!" 
line 5672=> 
line 5673=>
line 5674=>####-This  of  course  is  the way  to  talk  to  dragons,  if  you  don't want  to  reveal  your 
line 5675=>proper  name  (which  is  wise),  and  don't  want  to  infuriate  them  by  a  flat  refusal 
line 5676=>(which is also very wise). No dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk and 
line 5677=>of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here which Smaug did not 
line 5678=>understand  at  all  (though  I  expect  you  do,  since  you  know  all  about  Bilbo's 
line 5679=>adventures  to which  he was  referring), but he  thought he understood enough, and 
line 5680=>he chuckled in his wicked inside. 
line 5681=>"I  thought so  last night," he smiled  to himself. "Lake-men, some nasty scheme 
line 5682=>of those miserable tub-trading Lake-men, or I'm a lizard. I haven't been down that 
line 5683=>way for an age and an age; but I will soon alter that!" 
line 5684=>"Very  well,  O  Barrel-rider!"  he  said  aloud.  "Maybe  Barrel  was  your  pony's 
line 5685=>name;  and maybe  not,  though  it was  fat  enough. You may walk  unseen,  but  you 
line 5686=>did  not  walk  all  the  way.  Let  me  tell  you  I  ate  six  ponies  last  night  and  I  shall 
line 5687=>catch and eat all the others before long. In return for the excellent meal I will give 
line 5688=>you  one  piece  of  advice  for  your  good:  don't  have more  to  do with  dwarves  than 
line 5689=>you can help!" 
line 5690=>"Dwarves!" said Bilbo in pretended surprise. 
line 5691=>"Don't talk to me!" said Smaug. "I know the smell (and taste) of dwarf-no one 
line 5692=>better.  Don't  tell  me  that  I  can  eat  a  dwarf-ridden  pony  and  not  know  it!  You'll 
line 5693=>come  to  a  bad  end,  if  you  go with  such  friends. Thief Barrel-rider. I don't mind if 
line 5694=>you go back and tell them so from me." 
line 5695=>But he did not tell Bilbo that there was one smell he could not make out at all, 
line 5696=>hobbit-smell; it was quite outside his experience and puzzled him mightily.  
line 5697=>"I  suppose  you  got  a  fair  price  for  that  cup  last  night?"  he  went  on.  "Come 
line 5698=>now,  did  you? Nothing  at  all! Well,  that's  just  like  them. And  I  suppose  they  are 
line 5699=>skulking  outside,  and  your  job  is  to  do  all  the  dangerous work  and  get what  you 
line 5700=>can  when  I'm  not  looking-for  them?  And  you  will  get  a  fair  share?  Don't  you 
line 5701=>believe it! If you get off alive, you will be lucky." 
line 5702=> 
line 5703=>Bilbo  was  now  beginning  to  feel  really  uncomfortable.  Whenever  Smaug's 
line 5704=>roving  eye,  seeking  for  him  in  the  shadows,  flashed  across  him,  he  trembled,  and 
line 5705=>an unaccountable desire seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and tell 
line 5706=>all  the  truth  to  Smaug.  In  fact  he  was  in  grievous  danger  of  coming  under  the 
line 5707=>dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke again. 
line 5708=>"You  don't  know  everything, O  Smaug  the Mighty,"  said  he.  "Not  gold  alone 
line 5709=>brought us hither." 
line 5710=>
line 5711=>####-"Ha! Ha! You  admit  the  'us',"  laughed Smaug. "Why not say  'us fourteen' and 
line 5712=>be  done  with  it.  Mr.  Lucky  Number?  I  am  pleased  to  hear  that  you  had  other 
line 5713=>business  in  these  parts  besides  my  gold.  In  that  case  you  may,  perhaps,  not 
line 5714=>altogether waste your time. 
line 5715=>"I don't know if it has occurred to you that, even if you could steal the gold bit 
line 5716=>by bit-a matter of a hundred years or so – you could not get it very far? Not much 
line 5717=>use  on  the  mountain-side? Not much use  in  the  forest? Bless me! Had you never 
line 5718=>thought  of  the  catch?  A  fourteenth  share,  I  suppose,  Or  something  like  it,  those 
line 5719=>were  the  terms,  eh?  But  what  about  delivery? What  about  cartage? What  about 
line 5720=>armed guards and tolls?" And Smaug laughed aloud. He had a wicked and a wily 
line 5721=>heart,  and  he  knew  his  guesses  were  not  far  out,  though  he  suspected  that  the 
line 5722=>Lake-men were at the back of the plans, and that most of the plunder was meant to 
line 5723=>stop  there  in  the  town  by  the  shore  that  in  his  young  days  had  been  called 
line 5724=>Esgaroth. 
line 5725=>You will hardly believe  it, but poor Bilbo was  really very  taken aback. So far 
line 5726=>all  his.  thoughts  and  energies  had  been  concentrated  on  getting  to  the  Mountain 
line 5727=>and  finding  the  entrance. He  had  never  bothered  to wonder  how  the  treasure was 
line 5728=>to be removed, certainly never how any part of it that might fall to his share was to 
line 5729=>be brought back all the way to Bag-End Under-Hill. 
line 5730=>Now  a  nasty  suspicion  began  to  grow  in  his  mind-had  the  dwarves  forgotten 
line 5731=>this important point too, or were they laughing in their sleeves at him all the time? 
line 5732=>That  is  the effect  that dragon-talk has on the inexperienced. Bilbo of course ought 
line 5733=>to have been on his guard; but Smaug had rather an overwhelming personality.  
line 5734=>"I  tell you," he  said,  in  an  effort  to  remain  loyal  to his  friends  and  to keep his 
line 5735=>end up, "that gold was only an afterthought with  us. We came over hill and under 
line 5736=>hill,  by  wave  and  win,  for  Revenge.  Surely, O  Smaug  the  unassessably wealthy, 
line 5737=>you must realize that your success has made you some bitter enemies?" 
line 5738=>Then  Smaug  really  did  laugh-a  devastating  sound  which  shook  Bilbo  to  the 
line 5739=>floor, while  far  up  in  the  tunnel  the  dwarves  huddled  together  and  imagined  that 
line 5740=>the hobbit had come to a sudden and a nasty end. 
line 5741=>"Revenge!"  he  snorted,  and  the  light  of  his  eyes  lit  the  the  hall  from  floor  to 
line 5742=>ceiling like scarlet lightning. "Revenge! The King under the Mountain is dead and 
line 5743=>where are hi kin  that dare  seek  revenge? Girion Lord of Dale  is dead, and  I have 
line 5744=>eaten  his  people  like  a wolf  among  sheep,  and where  are  his  sons'  sons  that  dare 
line 5745=>approach me?  I  kill where  I wish  and  none  dare  resist.  I  laid  low  the warriors of 
line 5746=>old and their like is not in the world today. Then I was but young and tender. Now 
line 5747=>I  am  old  and  strong,  strong  strong.  Thief  in  the  Shadows!"  he  gloated.  "My 
line 5748=>
line 5749=>####-armour  is  like  tenfold shields, my  teeth are swords, my claws spears,  the shock of 
line 5750=>my tail a thunderbolt, my wings a hurricane, and my breath death!" 
line 5751=>"I  have  always  understood,"  said  Bilbo  in  a  frightened  squeak,  "that  dragons 
line 5752=>were softer underneath, especially in the region of the–er–chest; but doubtless one 
line 5753=>so fortified has thought of that." 
line 5754=>The dragon stopped short in his boasting. "Your information is antiquated," he 
line 5755=>snapped.  "I  am  armoured  above  and  below  with  iron  scales  and  hard  gems.  No 
line 5756=>blade can pierce me." 
line 5757=>"I might  have  guessed  it,"  said Bilbo.  "Truly  there  can;  nowhere  be found the 
line 5758=>equal of Lord Smaug the Impenetrable. What magnificence to possess a waistcoat 
line 5759=>of fine diamonds!" 
line 5760=>"Yes,  it  is  rare  and wonderful,  indeed,"  said  Smaug  absurdly  pleased. He  did 
line 5761=>not  know  that  the  hobbit  had  already  caught  a  glimpse  of  his  peculiar  under-
line 5762=>covering on his previous visit, and was itching for a closer view for reasons of his 
line 5763=>own. The dragon rolled over. "Look!" he said. "What do you say to that?" 
line 5764=>"Dazzlingly  marvellous!  Perfect!  Flawless!  Staggering!"  exclaimed  Bilbo 
line 5765=>aloud, but what he thought inside was: "Old fool! Why there is a large patch in the 
line 5766=>hollow of his left breast as bare as a snail out of its shell!" 
line 5767=>After  he  had  seen  that Mr. Baggins'  one  idea was  to  get  away.  "Well,  I  really 
line 5768=>must not detain Your Magnificence any longer," he  said, "or keep you from much 
line 5769=>needed  rest.  Ponies  take  some  catching,  I  believe,  after  a  long  start.  And  so  do 
line 5770=>burglars," he added as a parting shot, as he darted back and fled up the tunnel. 
line 5771=>It was an unfortunate remark, for  the dragon spouted  terrific flames after him, 
line 5772=>and  fast  though  he  sped  up  the  slope,  he  had  not  gone  nearly  far  enough  to  be 
line 5773=>comfortable  before  the  ghastly  head  of  Smaug  was  thrust  against  the  opening 
line 5774=>behind.  Luckily  the  whole  head  and  jaws  could  not  squeeze  in,  but  the  nostrils 
line 5775=>sent  forth  fire  and  vapour  to  pursue  him,  and  he  was  nearly  overcome,  and 
line 5776=>stumbled blindly on in great pain and fear. He had been feeling rather pleased with 
line 5777=>the  cleverness  of  his  conversation  with  Smaug,  but  his  mistake  at  the  end  shook 
line 5778=>him into better sense. 
line 5779=>"Never  laugh  at  live  dragons,  Bilbo  you  fool!"  he  said  to  himself,  and  it 
line 5780=>became  a  favourite  saying  of  his  later,  and  passed  into  a  proverb.  "You  aren't 
line 5781=>nearly through this adventure yet," he added, and that was pretty true as well. 
line 5782=> 
line 5783=>The afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled 
line 5784=>and  fell  in  a  faint  on  the  'door-step.'  The  dwarves  revived  him,  and  doctored  his 
line 5785=>scorches  as well  as  they  could; but  it was  a  long  time before  the hair on  the back 
line 5786=>
line 5787=>####-of  his  head  and  his  heels  grew  properly  again:  it had  all been  singed  and  frizzled 
line 5788=>right down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him up; 
line 5789=>and they were eager for his story, especially wanting to know why the dragon had 
line 5790=>made such an awful noise, and how Bilbo had escaped. 
line 5791=>But  the  hobbit  was  worried  and  uncomfortable,  and  they  had  difficulty  in 
line 5792=>getting anything out of him. On  thinking  things over he was now  regretting  some 
line 5793=>of the things he had said to the dragon, and was not eager to repeat them. The old 
line 5794=>thrush was sitting on a rock near by with his head cocked on one side, listening to 
line 5795=>all  that was  said.  It  shows what  an  ill  temper Bilbo was  in:  he  picked  up  a  stone 
line 5796=>and threw it at the thrush, which merely fluttered aside and came back. 
line 5797=>"Drat  the  bird!"  said  Bilbo  crossly.  "I  believe  he  is  listening,  and  I  don't  like 
line 5798=>the look of him." 
line 5799=>"Leave  him  alone!"  said Thorin.  "The  thrushes  are  good  and  friendly-this is a 
line 5800=>very  old  bird  indeed,  and  is  maybe  the  last  left  of  the  ancient  breed  that  used  to 
line 5801=>live about here, tame to the hands of my father and grandfather. They were a long-
line 5802=>lived and magical race, and this might even be one of those that were alive then, a 
line 5803=>couple of hundreds years or more ago. The Men of Dale used  to have  the  trick of 
line 5804=>understanding  their  language,  and  used  them  for messengers  to  fly  to  the Men of 
line 5805=>the Lake and elsewhere." 
line 5806=>"Well, he'll have news to take to Lake-town all right, if that is what he is after," 
line 5807=>said Bilbo; "though I don't suppose there are any people left there that trouble with 
line 5808=>thrush-language." 
line 5809=>"Why what has happened?" cried the dwarves. "Do get on with your tale!" 
line 5810=>So  Bilbo  told  them  all  he  could  remember,  and  he  confessed  that  he  had  a 
line 5811=>nasty  feeling  that  the  dragon  guessed  too  much  from  his  riddles  added  to  the 
line 5812=>camps  and  the  ponies.  "I  am  sure  he  knows  we  came  from  Lake-town  and  had 
line 5813=>help  from  there;  and  I  have  a  horrible  feeling  that  his  next  move  may  be  in  that 
line 5814=>direction.  I  wish  to  goodness  I  had  never  said  that  about  Barrel-rider;  it  would 
line 5815=>make even a blind rabbit in these parts think of the Lake-men." 
line 5816=>"Well,  well!  It  cannot  be  helped,  and  it  is  difficult  not  to  slip  in  talking  to  a 
line 5817=>dragon,  or  so  I  have  always  heard,"  said  Balin  anxious  to  comfort  him.  "I  think 
line 5818=>you  did  very well,  if  you  ask me-you found out one very useful thing at any rate, 
line 5819=>and got home alive, and  that  is more  than most can say who have had words with 
line 5820=>the likes of Smaug. It may be a mercy and a blessing yet to know of the bare patch 
line 5821=>in the old Worm's diamond waistcoat." 
line 5822=>That  turned  the  conversation,  and  they  all  began  discussing  dragon-slayings 
line 5823=>historical,  dubious,  and  mythical,  and  the  various  sorts  of  stabs  and  jabs  and 
line 5824=>
line 5825=>####-undercuts,  and  the  different  arts,  devices  and  stratagems  by which  they  had  been 
line 5826=>accomplished. The general opinion was that catching a dragon napping was not as 
line 5827=>easy as it sounded, and the attempt to stick one or prod one asleep was more likely 
line 5828=>to  end  in  disaster  than  a  bold  frontal  attack.  All  the  while  they  talked  the  thrush 
line 5829=>listened,  till  at  last when  the  stars  began  to  peep  forth,  it  silently  spread  its wings 
line 5830=>and  flew  away.  And  all  the  while  they  talked  and  the  shadows  lengthened  Bilbo 
line 5831=>became more and more unhappy and his foreboding 
line 5832=>At last he interrupted them. "I am sure we are very unsafe here," he said, "and 
line 5833=>I don't see the point of sitting here. The dragon has withered all the pleasant green, 
line 5834=>and  anyway  the  night  has  come  and  it  is  cold.  But  I  feel  it  in my  bones  that  this 
line 5835=>place will be attacked again. Smaug knows now how I came down to his hall, and 
line 5836=>you  can  trust  him  to  guess where  the  other  end  of  the  tunnel  is. He will break all 
line 5837=>this  side  of  the Mountain  to  bits,  if  necessary,  to  stop  up  our  entrance,  and  if  we 
line 5838=>are smashed with it the better he will like it." 
line 5839=>"You  are  very  gloomy,  Mr.  Baggins!"  said  Thorin.  "Why  has  not  Smaug 
line 5840=>blocked  the  lower  end,  then,  if  he  is  so  eager  to  keep  us  out?  He  has  not,  or  we 
line 5841=>should have heard him." 
line 5842=>"I  don't  know,  I  don't  know-because  at  first  he  wanted  to  try  and  lure  me  in 
line 5843=>again, I suppose, and now perhaps because he is waiting till after tonight's hunt, or 
line 5844=>because he does not want to damage his bedroom if he can help it – but I wish you 
line 5845=>would not argue. Smaug will be coming out at any minute now, and our only hope 
line 5846=>is to get well in the tunnel and shut the door." 
line 5847=>He  seemed  so much  in  earnest  that  the  dwarves  at  last  did  as  he said,  though 
line 5848=>they  delayed  shutting  the  door-it  seemed  a  desperate  plan,  for  no  one  knew 
line 5849=>whether  or  how  they  could  get  it  open  again  from  the  inside,  and  the  thought  of 
line 5850=>being  shut  in  a  place  from  which  the  only  way  out  led  through  the  dragon's  lair 
line 5851=>was  not  one  they  liked.  Also  everything  seemed  quite  quiet,  both  outside  and 
line 5852=>down the tunnel. So for a longish while they sat inside not far down from the half-
line 5853=>open  door  and  went  on  talking.  The  talk  turned  to  the  dragon's  wicked  words 
line 5854=>about the dwarves. Bilbo wished he had never heard them, or at least that he could 
line 5855=>feel quite certain that the dwarves now were absolutely honest when they declared 
line 5856=>that they had never thought at all about what would happen after the treasure had 
line 5857=>been won.  
line 5858=>"We  knew  it  would  be  a  desperate  venture,"  said  Thorin,  "and we  know  that 
line 5859=>still; and I still  think  that when we have won  it will be  time enough  to  think what 
line 5860=>to  do  about  it.  As  for  your  share,  Mr.  Baggins,  I  assure  you  we  are  more  than 
line 5861=>grateful and you shall choose you own fourteenth, as soon as we have anything to 
line 5862=>
line 5863=>####-divide, am sorry if you are worried about transport, and I admit the difficulties are 
line 5864=>great-the  lands  have  not  become  less  wild  with  the  passing  of  time,  rather  the 
line 5865=>reverse-but  we  will  do  whatever  we  can  for  you,  and  take  our  share  of  the  cost 
line 5866=>when the time comes. Believe me or not as you like!" 
line 5867=>From that the talk turned to the great hoard itself and to the things that Thorin 
line 5868=>and Balin remembered. They wondered if they were still lying there .unharmed in 
line 5869=>the  hall  below:  the  spears  that  were  made  for  the  armies  of  the  great  King 
line 5870=>Bladorthin  (long  since  dead),  each  had  a  thrice-forged head and  their  shafts were 
line 5871=>inlaid with  cunning gold, but  they were never delivered or paid  for;  shields made 
line 5872=>for warriors long dead; the great golden cup of Thror, two-handed, hammered and 
line 5873=>carven with birds and flowers whose eyes and petals were of jewels; coats of mail 
line 5874=>gilded and silvered and  impenetrable;  the necklace of Girion, Lord of Dale, made 
line 5875=>of five hundred emeralds green as grass, which he gave for the arming of his eldest 
line 5876=>son  in  a  coat  of  dwarf-linked rings the like of which had never been made before, 
line 5877=>for  it  was  wrought  of  pure  silver  to  the  power  and  strength  of  triple  steel.  But 
line 5878=>fairest  of  all  was  the  great  white  gem,  which  the  dwarves  had  found  beneath  the 
line 5879=>roots of the Mountain, the Heart of the Mountain, the Arkenstone of Thrain. 
line 5880=>"The  Arkenstone!  The  Arkenstone!"  murmured  Thorin  in  the  dark,  half 
line 5881=>dreaming with his chin upon his knees. "It was like a globe with a thousand facets; 
line 5882=>it shone like silver in the firelight, like water in the sun, like snow under the stars, 
line 5883=>like rain upon the Moon!" 
line 5884=>But  the enchanted desire of  the hoard had  fallen  from Bilbo. All  through  their 
line 5885=>talk  he  was  only  half  listening  to  them.  He  sat  nearest  to  the  door with  one  ear 
line 5886=>cocked  for  any  beginnings  of  a  sound  without,  his  other  was  alert  or  echoes 
line 5887=>beyond  the  murmurs  of  the  dwarves,  for  any  whisper  of  a  movement  from  far 
line 5888=>below.  
line 5889=>Darkness  grew  deeper  and  he  grew  ever  more  uneasy.  "Shut  the  door!"  he 
line 5890=>begged them. "I fear that dragon in my marrow. I like this silence far less than the 
line 5891=>uproar of last night. Shut the door before it is too late!" 
line 5892=>Something  in  his  voice  gave  the  dwarves  an  uncomfortable  feeling.  Slowly 
line 5893=>Thorin shook off his dreams and getting up he kicked away the stone that wedged 
line 5894=>the door. Then they thrust upon it, and it closed with a snap and a clang. No trace 
line 5895=>of a keyhole was there left on the inside. They were shut in the Mountain! 
line 5896=>And  not  a  moment  too  soon.  They  had  hardly  gone  any  distance  down  the 
line 5897=>tunnel  when  a  blow  smote  the  side  of  the  Mountain  like  the  crash  of  battering-
line 5898=>rams  made  of  forest  oaks  and  swung  by  giants.  The  rock  boomed,  the  walls 
line 5899=>cracked and stones fell from the roof on their heads. What would have happened if 
line 5900=>
line 5901=>####-the door had still been open I don't like to think. They fled further down the tunnel 
line 5902=>glad to be still alive, while behind them outside they heard the roar and rumble of 
line 5903=>Smaug's  fury.  He  was  breaking  rocks  to  pieces,  smashing  wall  and  cliff  with  the 
line 5904=>lashings  of  his  huge  tail,  till  their  little  lofty  camping ground,  the  scorched grass, 
line 5905=>the thrush's stone, the snail-covered walls, the narrow ledge, and all disappeared in 
line 5906=>a  jumble  of  smithereens,  and  an  avalanche  of  splintered  stones  fell  over  the  cliff 
line 5907=>into the valley below.  
line 5908=>Smaug  had  left  his  lair  in  silent  stealth,  quietly  soared  into  the  air,  and  then 
line 5909=>floated heavy and slow in the dark like a monstrous crow, down the wind towards 
line 5910=>the  west  of  the  Mountain,  in  the  hopes  of  catching  unawares  something  or 
line 5911=>somebody  there,  and  of  spying  the outlet  to  the passage which  the  thief had used. 
line 5912=>This  was  the  outburst  of  his  wrath  when  he  could  find  nobody  and  see  nothing, 
line 5913=>even where he guessed the outlet must actually be. 
line 5914=>After  he  had  let  off  his  rage  in  this  way  he  felt  better  and  he  thought  in  his 
line 5915=>heart that he would not be troubled again from that direction. In-the meanwhile he 
line 5916=>had further vengeance to take. "Barrel-rider!" he snorted. "Your fee came from the 
line 5917=>waterside  and  up  the water  you  came with  out  a  doubt.  I  don't  know  your  smell, 
line 5918=>but if you are not one of those men of the Lake, you had their help. They shall see 
line 5919=>me and remember who is the real King under the Mountain!" 
line 5920=>He rose in fire and went away south towards the Running River.  
line 5921=> 
line 5922=>
line 5923=>####-<h4>Chapter 13</h4> <br> 
line 5924=>
line 5925=>Not at Home 
line 5926=>
line 5927=> 
line 5928=>In  the  meanwhile,  the  dwarves  sat  in  darkness,  and  utter  silence  fell  about 
line 5929=>them.  Little  they  ate  and  little  they  spoke.  They  could  not  count  the  passing  of 
line 5930=>time; and  they  scarcely dared  to move,  for  the whisper of  their voices echoed and 
line 5931=>rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to silence going 
line 5932=>on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were 
line 5933=>becoming  choked  and  dazed  for  want  of  air,  they  could  bear  it  no  longer.  They 
line 5934=>would  almost  have  welcomed  sounds  from  below  of  the  dragon's  return.  In  the 
line 5935=>silence  they  feared  some  cunning  devilry  of  his,  but  they  could  not  sit  there  for 
line 5936=>ever. 
line 5937=>Thorin spoke: "Let us  try  the door!" he said. "I must feel  the wind on my face 
line 5938=>soon  or  die.  I  think  I  would  rather  be  smashed  by  Smaug  in  the  open  than 
line 5939=>suffocate in here!" 
line 5940=>So several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been. 
line 5941=>But  they  found  that  the  upper  end  of  the  tunnel  had  been  shattered  and  blocked 
line 5942=>with broken  rock. Neither key nor  the magic  it had once obeyed would ever  open 
line 5943=>that door again. 
line 5944=>"We are trapped!" they groaned. "This is the end. We shall die here." 
line 5945=>But  somehow,  just  when  the  dwarves  were  most  despairing,  Bilbo  felt  a 
line 5946=>strange  lightening  of  the  heart,  as  if  a  heavy  weight  had  gone  from  under  his 
line 5947=>waistcoat. 
line 5948=>"Come, come!" he  said.  "While  there's  life  there's hope!" as my  father used  to 
line 5949=>say,  and  'Third  time  pays  for  all.'  I  am  going  down  the  tunnel  once  again.  I  have 
line 5950=>been  that  way  twice,  when  I  knew  there  was  a  dragon  at  the  other  end,  so  I  will 
line 5951=>risk  a  third  visit  when  I  am  no  longer  sure.  Anyway  the  only  way  out  is  down. 
line 5952=>And I think time you had better all come with me." 
line 5953=>In desperation they agreed, and Thorin was the first go forward by Bilbo's side. 
line 5954=>"Now  do  be  careful!"  whispered  the  hobbit,  "and  quiet  as  you  can  be! There 
line 5955=>may be no Smaug at the bottom but then again there may be. Don't let us take any 
line 5956=>unnecessary risks!" 
line 5957=>Down,  down  they  went.  The  dwarves  could  not,  course,  compare  with  the 
line 5958=>hobbit  in  real  stealth,  and  the made  a  deal  of  puffing  and  shuffling which  echoes 
line 5959=>magnified alarmingly; but  though every now and again Bilbo  in  fear  stopped and 
line 5960=>listened,  not  a  sound  stirred  below  Near  the  bottom,  as  well  as  he  could  judge, 
line 5961=>
line 5962=>####-Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was 
line 5963=>complete,  and  they were  all  invisible,  ring  or  no  ring.  In  fact  so  black was  it  that 
line 5964=>the  hobbit  came  to  the  opening  unexpectedly,  put  his  hand  on  air,  stumbled  for 
line 5965=>ward, and rolled headlong into the hall! 
line 5966=>There he  lay face downwards on  the floor and did no dare  to get up, or hardly 
line 5967=>even  to  breathe.  But  nothing  moved.  There  was  not  a  gleam  of  light-unless,  as 
line 5968=>seemed to him, when at last he slowly raised his head, there was a pale white glint, 
line 5969=>above him and far off in the gloom. But certainly it was not a spark of dragon-fire, 
line 5970=>though the wormstench was heavy in the place, and the taste of vapour was on his 
line 5971=>tongue. 
line 5972=>At length Mr. Baggins could bear it no longer. "Come found you, Smaug, you 
line 5973=>worm!"  he  squeaked  aloud.  "Stop  playing  hide-and-seek!  Give  me  a  light,  and 
line 5974=>then eat me if you can catch me!" 
line 5975=>Faint echoes ran round the unseen hall, but there was no answer. Bilbo got up, 
line 5976=>and found that he did not know in what direction to turn. 
line 5977=>"Now  I  wonder  what  on  earth  Smaug  is  playing  at,"  he  said.  "He  is  not  at 
line 5978=>home  today  (or  tonight, or whatever it is), I do believe. If Oin and Gloin have not 
line 5979=>lost  their  time  tinder-boxes,  perhaps  we  can  make  a  little  light,  and  have  a  look 
line 5980=>round before the luck turns." 
line 5981=>"Light!" he cried. "Can anybody make a light?" 
line 5982=>The  dwarves,  of  course, were  very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the 
line 5983=>step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at 
line 5984=>the end the tunnel. 
line 5985=>"Sh!  sh!"  they  hissed,  when  they  heard  his  voice:  and  though  that  helped  the 
line 5986=>hobbit  to  find  out where  they  were, was  some  time  before  he  could  get  anything 
line 5987=>else out of  them. But  in  the end, when Bilbo actually began  to stamp  in  the  floor, 
line 5988=>and  screamed  out  light!'  at  the  top  of  his  thrill  voice,  Thorin  gave  way,  and  Oin 
line 5989=>and Gloin were sent back  to  their bundles  at the top of the tunnel. After a while a 
line 5990=>twinkling  gleam  showed  them  returning,  in  with  a  small  pine-torch  alight  in  his 
line 5991=>hand,  and  Gloin  with  a  bundle  of  others  under  his  arm.  Quickly  Bilbo  trotted  to 
line 5992=>the  door  and  took  the  torch;  but  he  could  not  persuade  the  dwarves  to  light  the 
line 5993=>others  or  to  come  and  join  him  yet.  As  Thorin  carefully  explained,  Mr.  Baggins 
line 5994=>was  still  officially  their  expert  burglar  and  investigator.  If  he  liked  to  risk  a  light, 
line 5995=>that was  his  affair.  They would wait  in  the  tunnel  for  his  report. So  they  sat near 
line 5996=>the door and watched. 
line 5997=>They  saw  the  little  dark  shape  of  the  hobbit  start  across  the  floor  holding  his 
line 5998=>tiny  light aloft. Every now and again, while he was still near enough,  they caught 
line 5999=>
line 6000=>####-a  glint  and  a  tinkle  as  he  stumbled  on  some  golden  thing. The  light grew  smaller 
line 6001=>as  he wandered  away  into  the  vast  hall;  then  it  began  to  rise  dancing  into  the  air. 
line 6002=>Bilbo was climbing  the great mound of  treasure. Soon he stood upon  the  top, and 
line 6003=>still  went  on.  Then  they  saw  him  halt  and  stoop  for  a  moment;  but  they  did  not 
line 6004=>know  the  reason.  It  was  the  Arkenstone,  the  Heart  of  the  Mountain.  So  Bilbo 
line 6005=>guessed  from  Thorin's  description;  but  indeed  there  could  not  be  two  such  gems, 
line 6006=>even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as he climbed, the same 
line 6007=>white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards Slowly it grew to a 
line 6008=>little  globe  of  pallid  light.  Now  as  came  near,  it  was  tinged  with  a  flickering 
line 6009=>sparkle  of man  colours  at  the  surface,  reflected  and  splintered  from  the wavering 
line 6010=>light  of  his  torch.  At  last  he  looked  down  upon  it  and  he  caught  his  breath.  The 
line 6011=>great  jewel  shone before he  feet of  its own  inner  light,  and yet,  cut  and  fashioned 
line 6012=>by  the  dwarves, who  had  dug  it  from  the  heart  of  the mountain  long  ago,  it  took 
line 6013=>all light that fell upon it and-changes it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance 
line 6014=>shot with glints of the rainbow.  
line 6015=>Suddenly  Bilbo's  arm  went  towards  it  drawn  by  it  enchantment.  His  small 
line 6016=>hand  would  not  close  about  it  for  it  was  a  large  and  heavy  gem;  but  he  lifted  it, 
line 6017=>shut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket. 
line 6018=>"Now  I  am  a  burglar  indeed!"  thought  he.  "But  I  suppose  I  must  tell  the 
line 6019=>dwarves  about  it-some  time. The  did  say  I  could  pick  and  choose my  own  share; 
line 6020=>and  I  think  I would  choose  this,  if  they  took  all  the  rest!" All  the same he had an 
line 6021=>uncomfortable  feeling  that  the picking and choosing had not  really been meant  to 
line 6022=>include  this marvellous gem, and  that  trouble would yet come of  it. Now he went 
line 6023=>on again. Down the other side of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of his 
line 6024=>torch  vanished  from  the  sight  of  the  watching  dwarves.  But  soon  they  saw  it  far 
line 6025=>away in the distance again. Bilbo was crossing the floor of the hall. 
line 6026=>He  went  on,  until  he  came  to  the  great  doors  at  the  further  side,  and  there  a 
line 6027=>draught  of  air  refreshed him, but  it almost puffed out his  light. He peeped  timidly 
line 6028=>through and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of wide 
line 6029=>stairs  going  up  into  the  gloom. And  still  there was  no  sight  nor  sound  of  Smaug. 
line 6030=>He was  just  going  to  turn  and  go back, when  a black  shape  swooped  at him  and 
line 6031=>brushed his face. He squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. His torch 
line 6032=>dropped head downwards and went out! 
line 6033=>"Only  a  bat,  I  suppose  and  hope!"  he  said  miserably.  But  now  what  am  I  to 
line 6034=>do? Which is East, South, North West?" 
line 6035=>
line 6036=>####-"Thorin! Balin! Oin! Gloin! Fill! Kili!"  he  cried  as  loud  he  could-it seemed a 
line 6037=>thin  little  noise  in  the wide  blackness.  "The  light's  gone  out!  Someone  come  and 
line 6038=>find and help me!" For the moment his courage had failed together.  
line 6039=>Faintly  the  dwarves  heard  his  small  cries,  though  the  only  word  they  could 
line 6040=>catch was 'help!' 
line 6041=>"Now what on earth or under it has happened?" said Thorin. "Certainly not the 
line 6042=>dragon, or he would not go on squeaking." 
line 6043=>They waited a moment or two, and still there were no dragon-noises, no sound 
line 6044=>at  all  in  fact  but  Bilbo's  distant  voice.  "Come,  one  of  you,  get  another  light  or 
line 6045=>two!" Thorin ordered. "It seems we have got to go and help our burglar." 
line 6046=>"It  is  about  our  turn  to  help,"  said  Balin,  "and  I  am  quite  willing  to  go. 
line 6047=>Anyway I expect it is safe for the moment." 
line 6048=>Gloin  lit  several  more  torches,  and  then  they  all  crept  out,  one  by  one,  and 
line 6049=>went  along  the  wall  as  hurriedly  as  they  could.  It  was  not  long  before  they  met 
line 6050=>Bilbo  himself  coming  back  towards  them.  His  wits  had  quickly returned soon as 
line 6051=>he saw the twinkle of their lights. 
line 6052=>"Only  a  bat  and  a  dropped  torch,  nothing  worse!"  he  said  in  answer  to  their 
line 6053=>questions.  Though  they  were  much  relieved,  they  were  inclined  to  be  grumpy  at 
line 6054=>being frightened for nothing; but what they would have said, if he had told them at 
line 6055=>that  moment  about  the  Arkenstone,  I  don't  know.  The  mere  fleeting  glimpses  of 
line 6056=>treasure  which  they  had  caught  as  they  went  along  had  rekindled  all  the  fire  of 
line 6057=>their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is 
line 6058=>wakened  by  gold  and  by  jewels,  he  grows  suddenly  bold,  and  he  may  become 
line 6059=>fierce. 
line 6060=>The  dwarves  indeed  no  longer  needed  any  urging.  All  were  now  eager  to 
line 6061=>explore  the  hall  while  they  had  the  chance,  and  willing  to  believe  that,  for  the 
line 6062=>present,  Smaug  was  away  from  home.  Each  now  gripped  a  lighted  torch;  and  as 
line 6063=>they  gazed,  first  on  one  side  and  then  on  another,  they  forgot  fear  and  even 
line 6064=>caution.  They  spoke  aloud,  and  cried  out  to  one  another,  as  they  lifted  old 
line 6065=>treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light caressing and 
line 6066=>fingering them. Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging 
line 6067=>there many  golden  harps  strung with  silver  they  took  them  and  struck  them;  and 
line 6068=>being  magical  (and  also  untouched  by  the  dragon,  who  had  small  interests  in 
line 6069=>music)  they  were  still  in  tune.  The  dark  hall  was  filled  with  a  melody  that  had 
line 6070=>long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical; they gathered gems 
line 6071=>and stuffed  their pockets, and  let what  they could  not carry far back through their 
line 6072=>fingers  with  a  sigh.  Thorin  was  not  least  among  these;  but  always  he  searched 
line 6073=>
line 6074=>####-from side to side for something which he could not find. It was the Arkenstone but 
line 6075=>he spoke of it yet to no one. 
line 6076=>Now  the  dwarves  took  down  mail  and  weapons  from  the  walls,  and  armed 
line 6077=>themselves. Royal indeed did Thorin look, clad in a coat of gold-plated rings, with 
line 6078=>a silver hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones. 
line 6079=>"Mr.  Baggins!"  he  cried.  "Here  is  the  first  payment  of  your  reward!  Cast  off 
line 6080=>your old coat and put on this!" 
line 6081=>With  that  he  put  on  Bilbo  a  small  coat  of mail,  wrought  for  some  young  elf-
line 6082=>prince long ago. It was of silver-steel which the elves call mithril, and with it went 
line 6083=>a belt of pearls and crystals. A  light helm of  figured  leather, strengthened beneath 
line 6084=>with hoops of steel, and studded about the bring with white gems, was set upon the 
line 6085=>hobbit's head. 
line 6086=>"I  feel magnificent," he  thought;  "but  I expect  I  look  rather absurd. How  they 
line 6087=>would laugh on the Hill at home Still I wish there was a looking-glass handy!" 
line 6088=>All  the  same Mr. Baggins  kept  his  head more  clear  of  the  bewitchment  of  the 
line 6089=>hoard  than  the dwarves did. Long before  the dwarves were  tired of examining  the 
line 6090=>treasures he became wary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder 
line 6091=>nervously what the end of it all would be 
line 6092=>"I would give a good many of  these precious goblets,    thought, "for a drink of 
line 6093=>something cheering out of one Beorn's wooden bowls!" 
line 6094=>"Thorin!"  he  cried  aloud.  "What  next? We  are  armed,  but what  good  has  any 
line 6095=>armour ever been before against Smaug the Dreadful? This treasure is not yet won 
line 6096=>back.  We  are  not  looking  for  gold  yet,  but  for  a  way  of  escape;  and  we  have 
line 6097=>tempted luck too long!" 
line 6098=>'"You speak the truth!" answered Thorin, recovering his wits. "Let us go! I will 
line 6099=>guide you. Not  in a  thousand years should  I  forget  the ways of  this palace." Then 
line 6100=>he  hailed  the  others,  and  they  gathered  together,  and  holding  their  torches  above 
line 6101=>their  heads  they  passed  through  the  gaping  doors,  not  without many  a  backward 
line 6102=>glance of longing. 
line 6103=>Their  glittering  mail  they  had  covered  again  with  their  old  cloaks  and  their 
line 6104=>bright helms with their tattered hoods, and one by one they walked behind Thorin, 
line 6105=>a  line  of  little  lights  in  the  darkness  that  halted  often,  listening  in  fear  once more 
line 6106=>for any  rumour of  the dragon's coming. Though all  the old adornments were  long 
line 6107=>mouldered  or  destroyed,  and  though  all  was  befouled  and  blasted  with  the 
line 6108=>comings  and  goings  of  the  monster,  Thorin  knew  every  passage  and  every  turn. 
line 6109=>They  climbed  long  stairs,  and  turned  and  went  down  wide  echoing  ways,  and 
line 6110=>turned again and climbed yet more stairs, and yet more' stairs again. 
line 6111=>
line 6112=>####-These were  smooth,  cut  out  of  the  living  rock  broad  and  lair;  and  up,  up,  the 
line 6113=>dwarves went, and  they met no sign of any  living  thing, only furtive shadows that 
line 6114=>fled  from  the  approach  of  their  torches  fluttering  in  the  draughts.  The  steps were 
line 6115=>not made, all the same, for hobbit-legs, and Bilbo was just feeling that he could go 
line 6116=>on no longer, when suddenly the roof sprang high and far beyond the reach of their 
line 6117=>torch-light.  A  white  glimmer  could  be  seen  coming  through  some  opening  far 
line 6118=>above,  and  the  air  smelt  sweeter.  Before  them  light  came  dimly  through  great 
line 6119=>doors, that hung twisted on their hinges and half burnt. 
line 6120=>"This  is  the  great  chamber  of Thror,"  said Thorin; "the hall of  feasting and of 
line 6121=>council. Not far off now is the Front Gate." 
line 6122=>They passed through the ruined chamber. Tables were rotting there; chairs and 
line 6123=>benches were lying there overturned, charred and decaying. Skulls and bones were 
line 6124=>upon  the  floor  among  flagons  and  bowls  and  broken  drinking-horns and dust. As 
line 6125=>they  came  through  yet more  doors  at  the  further  end,  a  sound  of  water  fell  upon 
line 6126=>their ears, and the grey light grew suddenly more full. 
line 6127=>"There is the birth of the Running River," said Thorin. "From here it hastens to 
line 6128=>the Gate. Let us follow it!" 
line 6129=>Out  of  a  dark  opening  in  a  wall  of  rock  there  issued  a  boiling  water,  and  it 
line 6130=>flowed  swirling  in  a  narrow  channel,  carved  and  made  straight  and  deep  by  the 
line 6131=>cunning of ancient hands. Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough for many 
line 6132=>men  abreast.  Swiftly  along  this  they  ran,  and  round  a  wide-sweeping  turn-and 
line 6133=>behold!  before  them  stood  the  broad  light  of  day.  In  front  there  rose  a  tall  arch, 
line 6134=>still  showing  the  fragments  of  old  carven  work  within,  worn  and  splintered  and 
line 6135=>blackened  though  it was. A misty  sun  sent  its  pale  light  between  the  arms  of  the 
line 6136=>Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold. 
line 6137=>A whirl of bats frightened from slumber by their smoking torches flurried over 
line 6138=>them;  as  they  sprang  forward  their  feet  slithered  on  stones  rubbed  smooth  and 
line 6139=>slimed  by  the  passing  of  the  dragon.  Now  before  them  the  water  fell  noisily 
line 6140=>outward and foamed down towards the valley. They flung their pale torches to the 
line 6141=>ground,  and  stood  gazing  out  with  dazzled  eyes.  They  were  come  to  the  Front 
line 6142=>Gate, and were looking out upon Dale. 
line 6143=>"Well!"  said  Bilbo,  "I  never  expected  to  be  looking  out  of  this  door.  And  I 
line 6144=>never  expected  to  be  so  pleased  to  see  the  sun  again,  and  to  feel  the wind  on my 
line 6145=>face. But, ow! this wind is cold!" 
line 6146=>It  was.  A  bitter  easterly  breeze  blew  with  a  threat  of  oncoming  winter.  It 
line 6147=>swirled  over  and  round  the  arms  of  the  Mountain  into  the  valley,  and  sighed 
line 6148=>among the rocks. After their long time in the stewing depths of the dragon-haunted 
line 6149=>
line 6150=>####-caverns,  they  shivered  in  the  sun.  Suddenly  Bilbo  realized  that  he  was  not  only 
line 6151=>tired but also very hungry indeed. "It seems to be late morning," he said, "and so I 
line 6152=>suppose  it  is more  or  less  breakfast-time  –  if  there  is any breakfast  to have. But  I 
line 6153=>don't  feel  that  Smaug's  front  doorstep  is  the  safest  place  for  a  meal.  Do  let's  go 
line 6154=>somewhere where we can sit quiet for a bit!" 
line 6155=>"Quite  right!"  said  Balin.  "And  I  think  I  know  which  way  we  should  go:  we 
line 6156=>ought to make for the old look-out post at the Southwest corner of the Mountain." 
line 6157=>"How far is that?" asked the hobbit. 
line 6158=>"Five  hours march,  I  should  think.  It will  be  rough  going.  The  road  from  the 
line 6159=>Gate along  the  left edge of  the  stream  seems all broken up. But  look down  there! 
line 6160=>The river loops suddenly east across Dale in front of the ruined town. At that point 
line 6161=>there was once a bridge, leading to steep stairs that climbed up the right bank, and 
line 6162=>so to a road running towards Ravenhill. There is (or was) a path that left the road 
line 6163=>and climbed up to the post. A hard climb, too, even if the old steps are still there." 
line 6164=>"Dear  me!"  grumbled  the  hobbit.  "More  walking  and  more  climbing  without 
line 6165=>breakfast! I wonder how many breakfasts, and other meals, we have missed inside 
line 6166=>that nasty clockless, timeless hole?" 
line 6167=>As  a  matter  of  fact  two  nights  and  the  day  between  had  gone  by  (and  not 
line 6168=>altogether without  food)  since  the dragon  smashed  the magic door, but Bilbo had 
line 6169=>quite  lost  count,  and  it  might  have  been  one  night  or  a  week  of  nights  for  all  he 
line 6170=>could tell. 
line 6171=>"Come, come!" said Thorin  laughing – his spirits had begun to rise again, and 
line 6172=>he  rattled  the  precious  stones  in  his  pockets.  "Don't  call  my  place  a  nasty  hole! 
line 6173=>You wait till it has been cleaned and redecorated!" 
line 6174=>"That won't be till Smaug's dead," said Bilbo glumly. "In the meanwhile where 
line 6175=>is he? I would give a good breakfast to know. I hope he is not up on the Mountain 
line 6176=>looking down at us!" 
line 6177=> 
line 6178=>That idea disturbed the dwarves mightily, and they quickly decided that Bilbo 
line 6179=>and Balin were right. 
line 6180=>"We must move  away  from  here,"  said Don.  "I  feel  as  if his  eyes were on  the 
line 6181=>back of my head." 
line 6182=>"It's  a  cold  lonesome  place,"  said Bombur.  "There may  be  drink,  but  I  see  no 
line 6183=>sign of food. A dragon would always be hungry in such parts." 
line 6184=>"Come on! Come on!" cried the others. "Let us follow Balm's path!" 
line 6185=>Under the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among 
line 6186=>the  stones  on  the  left  side  of  the  river,  and  the  emptiness  and  desolation  soon 
line 6187=>
line 6188=>####-sobered  even Thorin  again. The  bridge  that Balin  had  spoken  of  they  found  long 
line 6189=>fallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the shallow noisy stream; 
line 6190=>but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient steps, and 
line 6191=>climbed  the  high  bank.  After  going  a  short  way  they  struck  the  old  road,  and 
line 6192=>before  long  came  to  a  deep  dell sheltered among  the rocks;  there  they rested for a 
line 6193=>while and had such a breakfast as they could, chiefly cram and water. (If you want 
line 6194=>to  know  what  cram  is,  I  can  only  say  that  I  don't  know  the  recipe;  but  it  is 
line 6195=>biscuitish,  keeps  good  indefinitely,  is  supposed  to  be  sustaining,  and  is  certainly 
line 6196=>not  entertaining,  being  in  fact  very  uninteresting  except  as  a  chewing  exercise.  It 
line 6197=>was made by the Lake-men for long journeys). 
line 6198=>After  that  they went on again; and now  the road struck westwards and  left  the 
line 6199=>river, and the great shoulder of the south-pointing mountain-spur drew ever nearer. 
line 6200=>At  length  they  reached  the  hill  path.  It  scrambled  steeply  up,  and  they  plodded 
line 6201=>slowly one behind the other, till at last in the late afternoon they came to the top of 
line 6202=>the ridge and saw the wintry sun going downwards to the West. 
line 6203=>Here  they  found  a  flat  place  without  a  wall  on  three  sides,  but  backed  to  the 
line 6204=>North by a  rocky  face  in which  there was an opening  like a door. From  that door 
line 6205=>there was a wide view East and South and West. 
line 6206=>"Here,"  said  Balin,  "in  the  old  days  we  used  always  to  keep  watchmen,  and 
line 6207=>that  door  behind  leads  into  a  rock-hewn  chamber  that  was  made  here  as  a 
line 6208=>guardroom.  There  were  several  places  like  it  round  the  Mountain.  But  there 
line 6209=>seemed small need for watching in the days of our prosperity, and the guards were 
line 6210=>made  over  comfortable,  perhaps  – otherwise we might have had  longer warnings 
line 6211=>of  the coming of  the dragon, and  things might have been different. Still,  "here we 
line 6212=>can now lie hid and sheltered for a while, and can see much without being seen." 
line 6213=>"Not much use, if we have been seen coming here," said Dori, who was always 
line 6214=>looking  up  towards  the Mountain's  peak,  as  if  he  expected  to  see Smaug  perched 
line 6215=>there like a bird on a steeple. 
line 6216=>"We must take our chance of that," said Thorin. "We can go no further to-day." 
line 6217=>"Hear, hear!" cried Bilbo, and flung himself on the ground. 
line 6218=>In the rock-chamber there would have been room for a hundred, and there was 
line 6219=>a  small  chamber  further  in,  more  removed  from  the  cold  outside.  It  was  quite 
line 6220=>deserted; not even wild animals seemed  to have used  it  in all  the days of Smaug's 
line 6221=>dominion. There they laid their burdens; and some threw themselves down at once 
line 6222=>and slept, but the others sat near the outer door and discussed their plans. 
line 6223=>In  all  their  talk  they  came  perpetually  back  to  one  thing: where was  Smaug? 
line 6224=>They  looked West  and  there was  nothing,  and  East  there was  nothing,  and  in  the 
line 6225=>
line 6226=>####-South  there  was  no  sign  of  the  dragon,  but  there  was  a  gathering  of  very  many 
line 6227=>birds. At  that  they gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer understanding it, 
line 6228=>when the first cold stars came out. 
line 6229=>
line 6230=>####-<h4>Chapter 14</h4> <br> 
line 6231=>
line 6232=>Fire and Water 
line 6233=>
line 6234=> 
line 6235=>Now  if you wish,  like  the dwarves,  to hear news of Smaug, you must go back 
line 6236=>again  to  the  evening  when  he  smashed  the  door  and  flew  off  in  rage,  two  days 
line 6237=>before. 
line 6238=>The  men  of  the  lake-town  Esgaroth  were  mostly  indoors,  for  the  breeze  was 
line 6239=>from the black East and chill, but a few were walking on the quays, and watching, 
line 6240=>as they were fond of doing, the stars shine out from the smooth patches of the lake 
line 6241=>as  they  opened  in  the  sky.  From  their  town  the  Lonely  Mountain  was  mostly 
line 6242=>screened  by  the  low  hills  at  the  far  end  of  the  lake,  through  a  gap  in  which  the 
line 6243=>Running  River  came  down  from  the North. Only  its  high  peak  could  they  see  in 
line 6244=>clear weather, and they looked seldom at it, for it was ominous and dreary even in 
line 6245=>the light of morning. Now it was lost and gone, blotted in the dark. 
line 6246=>Suddenly it flickered back to view; a brief glow touched it and faded. 
line 6247=>"Look!"  said  one.  "The  lights  again!  Last  night  the watchmen  saw  them start 
line 6248=>and fade from midnight until dawn. Something is happening up there." 
line 6249=>"Perhaps  the  King  under  the  Mountain  is  forging  gold,"  said  another.  "It  is 
line 6250=>long since he went north. It is time the songs began to prove themselves again." 
line 6251=>"Which  king?"  said  another  with  a  grim  voice.  "As  like  as  not  it  is  the 
line 6252=>marauding  fire  of  the  Dragon,  the  only  king  under  the  Mountain  we  have  ever 
line 6253=>known." 
line 6254=>"You  are  always  foreboding  gloomy  things!"  said  the  others.  "Anything  from 
line 6255=>floods to poisoned fish. Think of something cheerful!" 
line 6256=>Then  suddenly  a  great  light  appeared  in  the  low  place  in  the  hills  and  the 
line 6257=>northern end of the lake turned golden. 
line 6258=>"The King  beneath  the Mountain!"  they  shouted.  "His wealth  is  like  the  Sun, 
line 6259=>his silver like a fountain, his rivers golden run! The  river is running gold from the 
line 6260=>Mountain!"  they  cried,  and  everywhere  windows  were  opening  and  feet  were 
line 6261=>hurrying. 
line 6262=>There was once more a  tremendous excitement and enthusiasm. But  the grim-
line 6263=>voiced fellow ran hotfoot to the Master. "The dragon is coming or I am a fool!" he 
line 6264=>cried. "Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!" 
line 6265=>Then  warning  trumpets  were  suddenly  sounded,  and  echoed  along  the  rocky 
line 6266=>shores.  The  cheering  stopped  and  the  joy was  turned  to  dread.  So  it was  that  the 
line 6267=>dragon  did  not  find  them  quite  unprepared.  Before  long,  so  great was  his  speed, 
line 6268=>
line 6269=>####-they  could  see  him  as  a  spark  of  fire  rushing  towards  them  and  growing  ever 
line 6270=>huger  and more  bright,  and  not  the most  foolish  doubted  that  the  prophecies  had 
line 6271=>gone  rather wrong. Still  they had a  little  time. Every vessel  in  the town was filled 
line 6272=>with  water,  every  warrior  was  armed,  every  arrow  and  dart  was  ready,  and  the 
line 6273=>bridge  to  the  land  was  thrown  down  and  destroyed,  before  the  roar  of  Smaug's 
line 6274=>terrible  approach  grew  loud,  and  the  lake  rippled  red  as  fire  beneath  the  awful 
line 6275=>beating of his wings. 
line 6276=>Amid  shrieks  and  wailing  and  the  shouts  of  men  he  came  over  them,  swept 
line 6277=>towards the bridges and was foiled! The bridge was gone, and his enemies were on 
line 6278=>an  island  in  deep  water-too  deep  and  dark  and  cool  for  his  liking.  If  he  plunged 
line 6279=>into  it, a vapour and a steam would arise enough  to cover all  the  land with a mist 
line 6280=>for days; but  the  lake was mightier  than he,  it would quench him before he could 
line 6281=>pass through. 
line 6282=>Roaring  he  swept  back  over  the  town.  A  hail  of  dark  arrows  leaped  up  and 
line 6283=>snapped and  rattled on his  scales and  jewels, and  their  shafts  fell back kindled by 
line 6284=>his  breath  burning  and  hissing  into  the  lake.  No  fireworks  you  ever  imagined 
line 6285=>equalled the sights that night. At the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the 
line 6286=>trumpets  the  dragon's wrath blazed to its height, till he was blind and mad with it. 
line 6287=>No  one  had  dared  to  give  battle  to  him  for  many  an  age;  nor  would  they  have 
line 6288=>dared  now,  if  it  had  not  been  for  the  grim-voiced man  (Bard was his name), who 
line 6289=>ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them to fight 
line 6290=>to the last arrow.  
line 6291=>Fire leaped from the dragon's jaws. He circled for a while high in the air above 
line 6292=>them lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood 
line 6293=>with  leaping shadows of dense black at their feet. Then down he swooped straight 
line 6294=>through  the  arrow-storm,  reckless  in  his  rage,  taking  no  heed  to  turn  his  scaly 
line 6295=>sides towards his foes, seeking only to set their town ablaze. 
line 6296=>Fire  leaped  from  thatched  roofs  and  wooden  beam-ends  as  he  hurtled  down 
line 6297=>and  past  and  round  again,  though  all  had  been  drenched  with  water  before  he 
line 6298=>came. Once more water was flung by a hundred hands wherever a spark appeared. 
line 6299=>Back  swirled  the  dragon.  A  sweep  of  his  tail  and  the  roof  of  the  Great  House 
line 6300=>crumbled  and  smashed  down.  Flames  unquenchable  sprang  high  into  the  night. 
line 6301=>Another  swoop and another, and another house and  then another  sprang afire and 
line 6302=>fell;  and  still  no  arrow  hindered  Smaug  or  hurt  him  more  than  a  fly  from  the 
line 6303=>marshes.  Already  men  were  jumping  into  the  water  on  every  side.  Women  and 
line 6304=>children  were  being  huddled  into  laden  boats  in  the  market-pool. Weapons were 
line 6305=>flung down. There was mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old 
line 6306=>
line 6307=>####-songs  of mirth  to  come  had  been  sung  about  the  dwarves. Now men cursed  their 
line 6308=>names.  The  Master  himself  was  turning  to  his  great  gilded  boat,  hoping  to  row 
line 6309=>away  in  the confusion and save himself. Soon all  the  town would be deserted and 
line 6310=>burned down to the surface of the lake. That was the dragon's hope. They could all 
line 6311=>get  into  boats  for  all  he  cared.  There  he  could  have  fine  sport  hunting  them,  or 
line 6312=>they could stop till they starved. Let them try to get to land and he would be ready. 
line 6313=>Soon  he  would  set  all  the  shoreland  woods  ablaze  and  wither  every  field  and 
line 6314=>pasture.  Just  now  he  was  enjoying  the  sport  of  town-baiting  more  than  he  had 
line 6315=>enjoyed anything for years. But there was still a company of archers that held their 
line 6316=>ground among the burning houses. Their captain was Bard, grim-voiced and grim-
line 6317=>faced,  whose  friends  had  accused  him  of  prophesying  floods  and  poisoned  fish, 
line 6318=>though  they  knew  his  worth  and  courage.  He  was  a  descendant  in  long  line  of 
line 6319=>Girion, Lord of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped down  the Running River 
line 6320=>from  the  ruin  long  ago. Now  he  shot with  a  great yew bow,  till all his arrows but 
line 6321=>one were spent. The flames were near him. His companions were leaving him. He 
line 6322=>bent his bow for  the  last  time. Suddenly out of  the dark something fluttered  to his 
line 6323=>shoulder.  He  started-but  it was  only  an  old  thrush. Unafraid  it perched by his ear 
line 6324=>and it brought him news. Marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for 
line 6325=>he was of the race of Dale. 
line 6326=>"Wait! Wait!"  it  said  to  him.  "The moon  is  rising.  Look  for  the  hollow  of  the 
line 6327=>left  breast  as  he  flies  and  turns  above  you!" And while Bard paused  in wonder  it 
line 6328=>told  him  of  tidings  up  in  the  Mountain  and  of  all  that  it  had  heard.  Then  Bard 
line 6329=>drew his bow-string to his ear. The dragon was circling back, flying low, and as he 
line 6330=>came the moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered his great wings. 
line 6331=>"Arrow!"  said  the  bowman.  "Black  arrow!  I  have  saved  you  to  the  last.  You 
line 6332=>have never  failed me and always  I have  recovered you.  I had you  from my  father 
line 6333=>and  he  from  of  old.  If  ever  you  came  from  the  forges  of  the  true  king  under  the 
line 6334=>Mountain, go now and speed well!" 
line 6335=>The  dragon  swooped  once more  lower  than  ever,  and  as  he  turned  and  dived 
line 6336=>down his belly glittered white with  sparkling  fires of gems  in  the moon-but not in 
line 6337=>one place. The great bow  twanged. The black arrow sped straight from  the string, 
line 6338=>straight  for  the  hollow  by  the  left  breast  where  the  foreleg  was  flung  wide.  In  it 
line 6339=>smote and vanished, barb, shaft and  feather, so  fierce was  its  flight. With a shriek 
line 6340=>that  deafened men,  felled  trees  and  split  stone,  Smaug  shot  spouting  into  the  air, 
line 6341=>turned over and crashed down from on high in ruin. 
line 6342=>Full on  the  town he  fell. His  last  throes splintered  it  to sparks and gledes. The 
line 6343=>lake roared  in. A vast steam  leaped up, white  in  the sudden dark under  the moon. 
line 6344=>
line 6345=>####-There  was  a  hiss,  a  gushing  whirl,  and  then  silence.  And  that  was  the  end  of 
line 6346=>Smaug  and  Esgaroth,  but  not  of  Bard.  The waxing moon  rose  higher  and  higher 
line 6347=>and the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white fog into bending pillars and 
line 6348=>hurrying  clouds  and  drove  it  off  to  the West  to  scatter  in  tattered  shreds over  the 
line 6349=>marshes before Mirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the 
line 6350=>surface of  the  lake, and down  the wind came  the voices of  the people of Esgaroth 
line 6351=>lamenting  their  lost  town and goods and  ruined houses. But  they had  really much 
line 6352=>to be  thankful  for, had  they  thought of  it,  though  it  could hardly be  expected  that 
line 6353=>they should just then: three quarters of the people of the town had at least escaped 
line 6354=>alive;  their  woods  and  fields  and  pastures  and  cattle  and  most  of  their  boats 
line 6355=>remained undamaged; and the dragon was dead. What that meant they had not yet 
line 6356=>realized. 
line 6357=>They  gathered  in  mournful  crowds  upon  the  western  shores,  shivering  in  the 
line 6358=>cold wind,  and  their  first  complaints  and  anger were  against  the Master, who had 
line 6359=>left the town so soon, while some were still willing to defend it. 
line 6360=>"He  may  have  a  good  head  for  business-especially  his  own  business,"  some 
line 6361=>murmured, "but he  is no good when anything serious happens!" And  they praised 
line 6362=>the courage of Bard and his last mighty shot. "If only he had not been killed," they 
line 6363=>all  said,  "we  would  make  him  a  king.  Bard  the  Dragon-shooter  of  the  line  of 
line 6364=>Girion! Alas that he is lost!" 
line 6365=>And  in  the very midst of  their  talk, a  tall figure stepped from  the shadows. He 
line 6366=>was drenched with water, his black hair hung wet over his face and shoulders, and 
line 6367=>a fierce light was in his eyes. 
line 6368=>"Bard  is  not  lost!"  he  cried.  "He  dived  from  Esgaroth,  when  the  enemy  was 
line 6369=>slain. I am Bard, of the line of Girion; I am the slayer of the dragon!" 
line 6370=>"King  Bard!  King  Bard!"  they  shouted;  but  the Master  ground  his  chattering 
line 6371=>teeth. 
line 6372=>"Girion was lord of Dale, not king of Esgaroth," he said. "In the Lake-town we 
line 6373=>have  always  elected masters  from  among  the old  and wise,  and have not  endured 
line 6374=>the rule of mere fighting men. Let 'King Bard' go back to his own kingdom-Dale is 
line 6375=>now freed by his valour, and nothing binders his return. And any that wish can go 
line 6376=>with  him,  if  they  prefer  the  cold  shores  under  the  shadow  of  the Mountain  to  the 
line 6377=>green shores of the lake. The wise will stay here and hope to rebuild our town, and 
line 6378=>enjoy again in time its peace and riches." 
line 6379=>"We will have King Bard!" the people near at hand shouted in reply. "We have 
line 6380=>had  enough  of  the  old men  and  the money-counters!" And people further off took 
line 6381=>
line 6382=>####-up the cry: "Up the Bowman, and down with Moneybags," till the clamour echoed 
line 6383=>along the shore. 
line 6384=>"I  am  the  last man  to  undervalue  Bard  the  Bowman,"  said  the Master warily 
line 6385=>(for Bard now stood close beside him). "He has tonight earned an eminent place in 
line 6386=>the  roll  of  the  benefactors  of  our  town;  and  he  is  worthy  of  many  imperishable 
line 6387=>songs.  But,  why  O  People?"-and  here  the Master  rose  to  his  feet  and  spoke  very 
line 6388=>loud and clear – "why do I get all your blame? For what fault am I to be deposed? 
line 6389=>Who  aroused  the  dragon  from  his  slumber,  I might  ask? Who obtained of us rich 
line 6390=>gifts  and  ample  help,  and  led  us  to  believe  that  old  songs  could  come  true? Who 
line 6391=>played  on  our  soft  hearts  and  our  pleasant  fancies? What  sort  of  gold  have  they 
line 6392=>sent  down  the  river  to  reward  us?  Dragon-fire  and  ruin!  From  whom  should we 
line 6393=>claim the recompense of our damage, and aid for our widows and orphans?" 
line 6394=>As  you  see,  the Master  had  not  got  his  position  for  nothing.  The  result  of  his 
line 6395=>words  was  that  for  the  moment  the  people  quite  forgot  their  idea  of  a  new  king, 
line 6396=>and  turned  their angry  thoughts  towards Thorin and his company. Wild and bitter 
line 6397=>words were shouted from many sides; and some of those who had before sung the 
line 6398=>old  songs  loudest,  were  now  heard  as  loudly  crying  that  the  dwarves  had  stirred 
line 6399=>the dragon up against them deliberately! 
line 6400=>"Fools!" said Bard. "Why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? 
line 6401=>Doubtless  they  perished  first  in  fire,  before  Smaug  came  to  us."  Then  even  as  he 
line 6402=>was  speaking,  the  thought  came  into  his  heart  of  the  fabled  treasure  of  the 
line 6403=>Mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent. He thought of 
line 6404=>the Master's  words,  and  of  Dale  rebuilt,  and  filled  with  golden  bells,  if  he  could 
line 6405=>but find the men. 
line 6406=>At  length  he  spoke  again:  "This  is  no  time  for  angry  words.  Master,  or  for 
line 6407=>considering weighty plans of change. There is work to do. I serve you still-though 
line 6408=>after  a  while  I  may  think  again  of  your  words  and  go  North  with  any  that  will 
line 6409=>follow me." 
line 6410=>Then  he  strode  off  to  help  in  the  ordering  of  the  camps  and  in  the  care  of  the 
line 6411=>sick  and  the  wounded.  But  the  Master  scowled  at  his  back  as  he  went,  and 
line 6412=>remained  sitting  on  the  ground. He  thought much  but  said  little,  unless  it was  to 
line 6413=>call  loudly  for  men  to  bring  him  fire  and  food.  Now  everywhere  Bard  went  he 
line 6414=>found  talk  running  like  fire  among  the  people  concerning  the  vast  treasure  that 
line 6415=>was  now  unguarded.  Men  spoke  of  the  recompense  for  all  their  harm  that  they 
line 6416=>would soon get from it, and wealth over and to spare with which to buy rich things 
line 6417=>from  the  South;  and  it  cheered  them  greatly  in  their  plight.  That was as well,  for 
line 6418=>the night was bitter and miserable. Shelters could be contrived for few (the Master 
line 6419=>
line 6420=>####-had one)  and  there was  little  food  (even  the Master went  short). Many  took  ill of 
line 6421=>wet  and  cold  and  sorrow  that  night,  and  afterwards  died,  who  had  escaped 
line 6422=>uninjured from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was much 
line 6423=>sickness and great hunger.  
line 6424=>Meanwhile  Bard  took  the  lead,  and  ordered  things  as  he  wished,  though 
line 6425=>always  in  the  Master's  name,  and  he  had  a  hard  task  to  govern  the  people  and 
line 6426=>direct  the  preparations  for  their  protection  and  housing.  Probably  most  of  them 
line 6427=>would  have  perished  in  the winter  that  now  hurried  after  autumn,  if  help  had  not 
line 6428=>been to hand. But help came swiftly; for Bard at once had speedy messengers sent 
line 6429=>up  the  river  to  the Forest  to ask  the aid of  the King of  the Elves of  the Wood, and 
line 6430=>these messengers had found a host already on the move, although it was then only 
line 6431=>the third day after the fall of Smaug. 
line 6432=>The Elvenking had received news from his own messengers and from the birds 
line 6433=>that  loved  his  folk,  and  already  knew  much  of  what  had  happened.  Very  great 
line 6434=>indeed was  the commotion among all  things with wings  that dwelt on  the borders 
line 6435=>of  the Desolation of  the Dragon. The  air was  filled with  circling  flocks,  and  their 
line 6436=>swift-flying messengers  flew  here  and  there  across  the  sky.  Above  the  borders  of 
line 6437=>the  Forest  there  was  whistling,  crying  and  piping.  Far  over  Mirkwood  tidings 
line 6438=>spread: "Smaug is dead!" Leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. Even before 
line 6439=>the  Elvenking  rode  forth  the  news  had  passed west  right  to  the  pinewoods  of  the 
line 6440=>Misty Mountains; Beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at 
line 6441=>council in their caves. 
line 6442=>"That  will  be  the  last  we  shall  hear  of  Thorin  Oakenshield,  I  fear,"  said  the 
line 6443=>king. "He would have done better to have remained my guest. It is an ill wind, all 
line 6444=>the  same,"  he  added,  "that  blows  no  one  any  good."  For  he  too  had  not  forgotten 
line 6445=>the legend of the wealth of Thror. So it was that Bard's messengers found him now 
line 6446=>marching  with  many  spearmen  and  bowmen;  and  crows  were  gathered  thick, 
line 6447=>above him,  for  they  thought  that war was awakening again,  such as had not been 
line 6448=>in  those parts  for a  long age. But  the king, when he  received  the prayers of Bard, 
line 6449=>had  pity,  for  he  was  the  lord  of  a  good  and  kindly  people;  so  turning  his march, 
line 6450=>which  had  at  first  been  direct  towards  the  Mountain,  he  hastened  now  down  the 
line 6451=>river  to  the  Long  Lake.  He  had  not  boats  or  rafts  enough  for  his  host,  and  they 
line 6452=>were  forced  to  go  the  slower way  by  foot;  but  great  store  of  goods he sent ahead 
line 6453=>by water. Still elves are light–footed, and though they were not in these days much 
line 6454=>used  to  the  marches  and  the  treacherous  lands  between  the  Forest  and  the  Lake, 
line 6455=>their going was swift. Only five days after the death of the dragon they came upon 
line 6456=>the  shores and  looked on  the  ruins of  the  town. Their welcome was good, as may 
line 6457=>
line 6458=>####-be expected, and the men and their Master were ready to make any bargain for the 
line 6459=>future in return for the Elvenking's aid. 
line 6460=>Their plans were soon made. With the women and the children, the old and the 
line 6461=>unfit,  the  Master  remained  behind;  and  with  him  were  some  men  of  crafts  and 
line 6462=>many  skilled  elves;  and  they  busied  themselves  felling  trees,  and  collecting  the 
line 6463=>timber  sent  down  from  the  Forest.  Then  they  set  about  raising  many  huts  by  the 
line 6464=>shore  against  the  oncoming  winter;  and  also  under  the  Master's  direction  they 
line 6465=>began  the planning of a new  town, designed more fair and  large even  than before, 
line 6466=>but not  in  the  same place. They  removed northward higher up  the  shore;  for  ever 
line 6467=>after  they  had  a  dread  of  the  water  where  the  dragon  lay.  He  would  never  again 
line 6468=>return to his golden bed, but was stretched cold as stone, twisted upon the floor of 
line 6469=>the  shallows.  There  for  ages  his  huge  bones  could  be  seen  in  calm weather  amid 
line 6470=>the  ruined  piles  of  the old  town. But  few dared  to cross  the cursed spot, and none 
line 6471=>dared  to dive  into  the shivering water or recover  the precious stones  that fell from 
line 6472=>his rotting carcass. 
line 6473=>But  all  the men  of  arms  who  were  still  able,  and  the most  of  the  Elvenking's 
line 6474=>array,  got  ready  to march  north  to  the Mountain.  It  was  thus  that  in  eleven  days 
line 6475=>from the ruin of the town the head of their host passed the rock-gates at the end of 
line 6476=>the lake and came into the desolate lands. 
line 6477=>

line 6480=>The Gathering of the Clouds 
line 6481=>
line 6482=> 
line 6483=>Now  we  will  return  to  Bilbo  and  the  dwarves.  All  night  one  of  them  had 
line 6484=>watched,  but when morning  came  they  had  not  heard  or  seen  any  sign  of  danger. 
line 6485=>But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from 
line 6486=>the  South;  and  the  crows  that  still  lived  about  the Mountain  were  wheeling  and 
line 6487=>crying unceasingly above. 
line 6488=>"Something  strange  is  happening,"  said  Thorin.  "The  time  has  gone  for  the 
line 6489=>autumn  wanderings;  and  these  are  birds  that  dwell  always  in  the  land;  there  are 
line 6490=>starlings  and  flocks  of  finches;  and  far  off  there  are  many  carrion  birds  as  if  a 
line 6491=>battle were afoot!" 
line 6492=>Suddenly Bilbo pointed: "There  is  that old  thrush again!" he cried. "He seems 
line 6493=>to have escaped, when Smaug  smashed  the mountain-side, but I don't suppose the 
line 6494=>snails have!" 
line 6495=>Sure  enough  the  old  thrush was  there,  and  as  Bilbo  pointed,  he  flew  towards 
line 6496=>them  and  perched  on  a  stone  near  by. Then  he  fluttered  his wings  and  sang;  then 
line 6497=>he  cocked  his  head  on  one  side,  as  if  to  listen;  and  again  he  sang,  and  again  he 
line 6498=>listened. 
line 6499=>"I  believe  he  is  trying  to  tell  us  something,"  said  Balin;  "but  I  cannot  follow 
line 6500=>the  speech  of  such  birds,  it  is  very  quick  and  difficult.  Can  you  make  it  out 
line 6501=>Baggins?" 
line 6502=>"Not very well," said Bilbo (as a matter of fact, he could make nothing of it at 
line 6503=>all); "but the old fellow seems .very excited." 
line 6504=>"I only wish he was a raven!" said Balin. 
line 6505=>"I  thought  you  did  not  like  them!  You  seemed  very  shy  of  them,  when  we 
line 6506=>came this way before." 
line 6507=>"Those  were  crows!  And  nasty  suspicious-looking  creatures  at  that,  and  rude 
line 6508=>as  well.  You  must  have  heard  the  ugly  names  they were  calling  after  us. But  the 
line 6509=>ravens  are  different.  There  used  to  be  great  friendship  between  them  and  the 
line 6510=>people  of  Thror;  and  they  often  brought  us  secret  news,  and were  rewarded with 
line 6511=>such bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings. 
line 6512=>"They  live many  a  year,  and  their memories  are  long,  and  they  hand  on  their 
line 6513=>wisdom to their children. I knew many among the ravens of the rocks when I was 
line 6514=>a  dwarf-  lad.  This  very  height  was  once  named  Ravenhill,  because  there  was  a 
line 6515=>
line 6516=>####-wise  and  famous  pair,  old  Care  and  his  wife,  that  lived  here  above  the  guard-
line 6517=>chamber. But I don't suppose that any of that ancient breed linger here now." 
line 6518=>No  sooner  had  he  finished  speaking  than  the  old  thrush  gave  a  loud  call,  and 
line 6519=>immediately flew away.  
line 6520=>"We may not understand him, but that old bird understands us, I am sure," said 
line 6521=>Balin. "Keep watch now, and see what happens!" 
line 6522=>Before  long  there  was  a  fluttering  of  wings,  and  back  came  the  thrush;  and 
line 6523=>with him came a most decrepit old bird. He was getting blind, he could hardly fly, 
line 6524=>and  the  top of his head was bald. He was an aged raven of great size. He alighted 
line 6525=>stiffly  on  the  ground  before  them,  slowly  flapped  his wings,  and  bobbed  towards 
line 6526=>Thorin. 
line 6527=>"O  Thorin  son  of  Thrain,  and  Balin  son  of  Fundin,"  he  croaked  (and  Bilbo 
line 6528=>could  understand  what  he  said,  for  he  used  ordinary  language  and  not  bird-
line 6529=>speech).  "I  am  Róac  son  of  Carc.  Carc  is  dead,  but  he  was  well  known  to  you 
line 6530=>once. It is a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the egg, but I do 
line 6531=>not  forget what my  father  told me. Now  I  am  the  chief  of  the  great  ravens  of  the 
line 6532=>Mountain. We are few, but we remember still the king that was of old. Most of my 
line 6533=>people are abroad, for there are great tidings in the South – some are tidings of joy 
line 6534=>to you, and some you will not think so good. 
line 6535=>"Behold! the birds are gathering back again to the Mountain and to Dale from 
line 6536=>South and East and West, for word has gone out that Smaug is dead!" 
line 6537=>"Dead!  Dead?"  shouted  the  dwarves.  "Dead!  Then  we  have  been  in  needless 
line 6538=>fear-and the treasure is ours!" 
line 6539=>They all sprang up and began to caper about for joy.  
line 6540=>"Yes,  dead,"  said Róac. "The  thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die, 
line 6541=>and  we may  trust  his  words.  He  saw  him  fall  in  battle  with  the men  of  Esgaroth 
line 6542=>the third night back from now at the rising of the moon." 
line 6543=>It was some time before Thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen 
line 6544=>to  the  raven's  news. At  length when  he  had  told  all  the  tale  of  the  battle  he went 
line 6545=>on: 
line 6546=>"So  much  for  joy,  Thorin  Oakenshield.  You  may  go  back  to  your  halls  in 
line 6547=>safety;  all  the  treasure  is  yours-for  the  moment.  But  many  are  gathering  hither 
line 6548=>beside  the  birds.  The  news  of  the  death  of  the  guardian  has  already  gone  far  and 
line 6549=>wide, and the legend of the wealth of Thror has not lost in the telling during many 
line 6550=>years; many are eager for a share of the spoil. Already a host of the elves is on the 
line 6551=>way,  and  carrion birds  are with  them hoping  for battle  and  slaughter. By  the  lake 
line 6552=>men murmur  that  their sorrows are due  to  the dwarves; for  they are homeless and 
line 6553=>
line 6554=>####-many  have  died,  and  Smaug  has  destroyed  their  town.  They  too  think  to  find 
line 6555=>amends from your treasure, whether you are alive or dead. 
line 6556=>"Your  own wisdom must  decide  your  course,  but  thirteen  is  small  remnant  of 
line 6557=>the great folk of Durin that once dwelt here, and now are scattered far. If you will 
line 6558=>listen to my counsel, you will not trust the Master of the Lake-men, but rather him 
line 6559=>that  shot  the  dragon  with  his  bow.  Bard  is  he,  of  the  race  of  Dale,  of  the  line  of 
line 6560=>Girion; he is a grim man but true. We would see peace once more among dwarves 
line 6561=>and  men  and  elves  after  the  long  desolation;  but  it  may  cost  you  dear  in  gold.  I 
line 6562=>have spoken." 
line 6563=>Then Thorin burst forth in anger: "Our thanks, Róac Carc's son. You and your 
line 6564=>people shall not be forgotten. But none of our gold shall thieves take or the violent 
line 6565=>carry  off  while  we  are  alive.  If  you  would  earn  our  thanks  still  more,  bring  us 
line 6566=>news of any that draw near. Also I would beg of you, if any of you are still young 
line 6567=>and strong of wing, that you would send messengers to our kin in the mountains of 
line 6568=>the  North,  both  west  from  here  and  east,  and  tell  them  of  our  plight.  But  go 
line 6569=>specially to my cousin Dain in the Iron Hills, for he has many people well-armed, 
line 6570=>and dwells nearest to this place. Bid him hasten!" 
line 6571=>"I  will  not  say  if  this  counsel  be  good  or  bad,"  croaked  Róac;  "but  I will  do 
line 6572=>what can be done." Then off he slowly flew.  
line 6573=>"Back now to the Mountain!" cried Thorin. "We have little time to lose." 
line 6574=>"And  little  food  to  use!"  cried  Bilbo,  always  practical  on  such  points.  In  any 
line 6575=>case  he  felt  that  the  adventure was, properly speaking, over  .with  the death of  the 
line 6576=>dragon-in  which  he  was  much  mistaken-and  he  would  have  given  most  of  his 
line 6577=>share of the profits for the peaceful winding up of these affairs. 
line 6578=>"Back  to  the  Mountain!"  cried  the  dwarves  as  if  they  had  not  heard  him;  so 
line 6579=>back he had  to go with  them. As you have heard  some of  the  events  already, you 
line 6580=>will  see  that  the  dwarves  still  had  some  days  before  them.  They  explored  the 
line 6581=>caverns  once  more,  and  found,  as  they  expected,  that  only  the  Front  Gate 
line 6582=>remained  open;  all  the  other  gates  (except,  of  course,  the  small  secret  door)  had 
line 6583=>long  ago  been  broken  and  blocked  by  Smaug,  and  no  sign  of  them  remained.  So 
line 6584=>now  they  began  to  labour  hard  in  fortifying  the  main  entrance,  and  in  remaking 
line 6585=>the  road  that  led  from  it.  Tools  were  to  be  found  in  plenty  that  the  miners  and 
line 6586=>quarriers  and  builders  of  old  had  used;  and  at  such  work  the  dwarves  were  still 
line 6587=>very skilled. 
line 6588=>As  they  worked  the  ravens  brought  them  constant  tidings.  In  this  way  they 
line 6589=>learned  that  the  Elvenking  had  turned  aside  to  the  Lake,  and  they  still  had  a 
line 6590=>breathing  space. Better  still,  they heard  that  three of  their ponies had escaped and 
line 6591=>
line 6592=>####-were wandering wild far down the banks of the Running River, not far from where 
line 6593=>the  rest of  their  stores had been  left. So while  the others went on with  their work, 
line 6594=>Fili  and  Kili  were  sent,  guided  by  a  raven,  to  find  the  ponies  and  bring  back  all 
line 6595=>they could. 
line 6596=>They were  four  days  gone,  and  by  that  time  they  knew  that  the  joined  armies 
line 6597=>of  the  Lake-men  and  the  Elves  were  hurrying  towards  the  Mountain.  But  now 
line 6598=>their hopes were higher; for they had food for some weeks with care-chiefly cram, 
line 6599=>of course, and they were very tired of it; but cram is much better than nothing-and 
line 6600=>already the gate was blocked with a wall of squared stones laid dry, but very thick 
line 6601=>and  high  across  the  opening.  There  were  holes  in  the  wall  through  which  they 
line 6602=>could  see  (or  shoot)  but  no  entrance.  They  climbed  in  or  out  with  ladders,  and 
line 6603=>hauled stuff up with ropes. For the issuing of the stream they had contrived a small 
line 6604=>low arch under the new wall; but near the entrance they had so altered the narrow 
line 6605=>bed  that  a wide pool  stretched  from  the mountain-wall to the head of the fall over 
line 6606=>which  the  stream  went  towards  Dale.  Approach  to  the  Gate  was  now  only 
line 6607=>possible, without  swimming,  along  a narrow  ledge of  the  cliff,  to  the  right  as one 
line 6608=>looked  outwards  from  the wall.  The  ponies  they  had  brought  only  to  the  head  of 
line 6609=>the  steps  above  the  old  bridge,  and  unloading  them  there  had  bidden  them  return 
line 6610=>to their masters and sent them back riderless to the South. 
line 6611=>There  came  a  night  when  suddenly  there  were  many  lights  as  of  fires  and 
line 6612=>torches away south in Dale before them. 
line 6613=>"They  have  come!"  called  Balin.  "And  their  camp  is  very  great.  They  must 
line 6614=>have come into the valley under the cover of dusk along both banks of the river." 
line 6615=>That night the dwarves slept little. The morning was still pale when they saw a 
line 6616=>company approaching. From behind  their wall  they watched  them come up  to  the 
line 6617=>valley's head and climb slowly up. Before long they could see that both men of the 
line 6618=>lake  armed  as  if  for  war  and  elvish  bowmen  were  among  them.  At  length  the 
line 6619=>foremost  of  these  climbed  the  tumbled  rocks  and  appeared  at  the  top  of  the  falls; 
line 6620=>and very great was their surprise to see the pool before them and the Gate blocked 
line 6621=>with a wall of new-hewn stone. 
line 6622=>As they stood pointing and speaking to one another Thorin hailed them: "Who 
line 6623=>are  you,"  he  called  in  a  very  loud  voice,  "that  come  as  if  in  war  to  the  gates  of 
line 6624=>Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain, and what do you desire?" 
line 6625=>But  they  answered  nothing.  Some  turned  swiftly  back,  and  the  others  after 
line 6626=>gazing  for  a while  at  the Gate  and  its  defences  soon  followed  them. That  day  the 
line 6627=>camp was moved  and was  brought  right  between  the  arms  of  the Mountain.  The 
line 6628=>rocks echoed then with voices and with song, as they had not done for many a day. 
line 6629=>
line 6630=>####-There was  the  sound,  too,  of  elven-harps and of sweet music; and as  it echoed up 
line 6631=>towards  them  it  seemed  that  the  chill  of  the  air  was  warmed,  and  they  caught 
line 6632=>faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring. 
line 6633=>Then Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress and to go down and join in 
line 6634=>the mirth  and  feasting  by  the  fires.  Some  of  the  younger  dwarves were moved  in 
line 6635=>their  hearts,  too,  and  they  muttered  that  they  wished  things  had  fallen  out 
line 6636=>otherwise and that they might welcome such folk as friends; but Thorin scowled. 
line 6637=>Then  the  dwarves  themselves  brought  forth  harps  and  instruments  regained 
line 6638=>from  the  hoard,  and  made  music  to  soften  his  mood;  but  their  song  was  not  as 
line 6639=>elvish song, and was much like the song they had sung long before in Bilbo's little 
line 6640=>hobbit-hole. 
line 6641=> 
line 6642=>
line 6643=>Under the Mountain dark and tall 
line 6644=>The King has come unto his hall! 
line 6645=>His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread, 
line 6646=>And ever so his foes shall fall. 
line 6647=> 
line 6648=>The sword is sharp, the spear is long, 
line 6649=>The arrow swift, the Gate is strong; 
line 6650=>The heart is bold that looks on gold; 
line 6651=>The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong. 
line 6652=> 
line 6653=>The dwarves of yore made mighty spells, 
line 6654=>While hammers fell like ringing bells 
line 6655=>In places deep, where dark things sleep, 
line 6656=>In hollow halls beneath the fells. 
line 6657=> 
line 6658=>On silver necklaces they strung 
line 6659=>The light of stars, on crowns they hung 
line 6660=>The dragon-fire, from twisted wire  
line 6661=>The melody of harps they wrung. 
line 6662=> 
line 6663=>The mountain throne once more is freed! 
line 6664=>O! wandering folk, the summons heed! 
line 6665=>Come haste! Come haste! across the waste! 
line 6666=>The king of friend and kin has need. 
line 6667=> 
line 6668=>Now call we over mountains cold, 
line 6669=>'Come hack unto the caverns old'! 
line 6670=>Here at the Gates the king awaits, 
line 6671=>
line 6672=>####-His hands are rich with gems and gold. 
line 6673=> 
line 6674=>The king is come unto his hall 
line 6675=>Under the Mountain dark and tall. 
line 6676=>The Worm of Dread is slain and dead, 
line 6677=>And ever so our foes shall fall! 
line 6678=>
line 6679=> 
line 6680=>This song appeared to please Thorin, and he smiled again and grew merry; and 
line 6681=>he began reckoning the distance to the Iron Hills and how long it would be before 
line 6682=>Dain  could  reach  the  Lonely Mountain,  if  he  had  set  out  as  soon  as  the message 
line 6683=>reached  him.  But  Bilbo's  heart  fell,  both  at  the  song  and  the  talk:  they  sounded 
line 6684=>much  too  warlike.  The  next  morning  early  a  company  of  spearmen  was  seen 
line 6685=>crossing  the  river,  and  marching  up  the  valley.  They  bore  with  them  the  green 
line 6686=>banner of the Elvenking and the blue banner of the Lake, and they advanced until 
line 6687=>they stood right before the wall at the Gate. 
line 6688=>Again Thorin hailed  them  in a  loud voice: "Who are you  that come armed for 
line 6689=>war to the gates of Thorin son of Thrain, King under the Mountain?" This time he 
line 6690=>was answered. 
line 6691=>A  tall  man  stood  forward,  dark  of  hair  and  grim  of  face,  and  he  cried:  "Hail 
line 6692=>Thorin! Why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? We are not yet foes, 
line 6693=>and  we  rejoice  that  you  are  alive  beyond  our  hope.  We  came  expecting  to  find 
line 6694=>none  living  here;  yet  now  that  we  are  met  there  is  matter  for  a  parley  and  a 
line 6695=>council." 
line 6696=>"Who are you, and of what would you parley?" 
line 6697=>"I am Bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure delivered. 
line 6698=>Is that not a matter that concerns you? Moreover I am by right descent the heir of 
line 6699=>Girion of Dale,  and  in your hoard  is mingled much of  the wealth of his halls  and 
line 6700=>town,  which  of  old  Smaug  stole.  Is  not  that  a  matter  of  which  we  may  speak? 
line 6701=>Further  in  his  last  battle  Smaug  destroyed  the  dwellings  of  the men  of  Esgaroth, 
line 6702=>and  I  am  yet  the  servant  of  their Master.  I would  speak  for  him  and  ask whether 
line 6703=>you  have  no  thought  for  the  sorrow  and misery  of  his  people.  They  aided  you  in 
line 6704=>your  distress,  and  in  recompense  you  have  thus  far  brought  ruin  only,  though 
line 6705=>doubtless undesigned." 
line 6706=>Now  these were  fair words and  true,  if proudly and grimly  spoken; and Bilbo 
line 6707=>thought  that Thorin would at once admit what  justice was  in  them. He did not, of 
line 6708=>course,  expect  that  any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by 
line 6709=>himself the dragon's weak spot; and that was just as well, for no one ever did. But 
line 6710=>also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has long 
line 6711=>
line 6712=>####-brooded,  nor with  dwarvish  hearts. Long hours  in  the past days Thorin had  spent 
line 6713=>in the treasury, and the lust of it was heavy on him. Though he had hunted chiefly 
line 6714=>for  the Arkenstone, yet he had  an  eye  for many  another wonderful  thing  that was 
line 6715=>lying there, about which were wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows 
line 6716=>of his race. 
line 6717=>"You  put  your worst  cause  last  and  in  the  chief  place," Thorin  answered.  "To 
line 6718=>the treasure of my people no man has a claim, because Smaug who stole it from us 
line 6719=>also  robbed  him  of  life  or  home.  The  treasure  was  not  his  that  his  evil  deeds 
line 6720=>should  be  amended  with  a  share  of  it.  The  price  of  the  goods  and  the  assistance 
line 6721=>that we  received of  the Lake-men we will fairly pay-in due time. But nothing will 
line 6722=>we  give,  not  even  a  loaf's  worth,  under  threat  of  force. While  an  armed host  lies 
line 6723=>before our doors, we look on you as foes and thieves. 
line 6724=>"It is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to 
line 6725=>our kindred, had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain." 
line 6726=>"A just question," replied Bard. "But you are not dead, and we are not robbers. 
line 6727=>Moreover  the  wealthy  may  have  pity  beyond  right  on  the  needy  that  befriended 
line 6728=>them when they were in want. And still my other claims remain unanswered." 
line 6729=>"I will  not  parley,  as  I  have  said, with  armed men  at my  gate. Nor  at all with 
line 6730=>the people of the Elvenking, whom I remember with small kindness. In this debate 
line 6731=>they have no place. Begone now ere our arrows fly! And if you would speak with 
line 6732=>me  again,  first  dismiss  the  elvish  host  to  the  woods  where  it  belongs,  and  then 
line 6733=>return, laying down your arms before you approach the threshold." 
line 6734=>"The Elvenking  is my  friend,  and  he  has  succoured  the  people  of  the Lake  in 
line 6735=>their need, though they had no claim but friendship on him," answered Bard. "We 
line 6736=>will  give  you  time  to  repent  your  words.  Gather  your  wisdom  ere  we  return!" 
line 6737=>Then he departed and went back to the camp. 
line 6738=>Ere  many  hours  were  past,  the  banner-bearers  returned,  and  trumpeters  stood 
line 6739=>forth and blew a blast: 
line 6740=>"In  the  name  of  Esgaroth  and  the  Forest,"  one  cried,  "we  speak  unto  Thorin 
line 6741=>Thrain's  son  Oakenshield,  calling  himself  the  King  under  the  Mountain,  and  we 
line 6742=>bid him consider well  the claims  that have been urged, or be declared our  foe. At 
line 6743=>the  least  he  shall  deliver  one  twelfth  portion  of  the  treasure  unto  Bard,  as  the 
line 6744=>dragon-slayer,  and  as  the  heir  of  Girion.  From  that  portion  Bard  will  himself 
line 6745=>contribute  to  the  aid  of  Esgaroth;  but  if  Thorin  would  have  the  friendship  and 
line 6746=>honour of the lands about, as his sires had of old, then he will give also somewhat 
line 6747=>of his own  for  the comfort of  the men of  the Lake." Then Thorin seized a bow of 
line 6748=>
line 6749=>####-horn  and  shot  an  arrow  at  the  speaker.  It  smote  into  his  shield  and  stuck  there 
line 6750=>quivering. 
line 6751=>'"Since  such  is  your  answer,"  he  called  in  return,  "I  declare  the  Mountain 
line 6752=>besieged. You shall not depart from it, until you call on your side for a truce and a 
line 6753=>parley. We will bear no weapons against you, but we leave you to your gold. You 
line 6754=>may eat that, if you will!" 
line 6755=>With  that  the  messengers  departed  swiftly,  and  the  dwarves  were  left  to 
line 6756=>consider  their  case. So grim had Thorin become, that even if they had wished, the 
line 6757=>others  would  not  have  dared  to  find  fault  with  him;  but  indeed  most  of  them 
line 6758=>seemed  to  share  his mind-except perhaps old fat Bombur and Fili and Kili. Bilbo, 
line 6759=>of course, disapproved of  the whole  turn of affairs. He had by now had more than 
line 6760=>enough of the Mountain, and being besieged inside it was not at all to his taste. 
line 6761=>"The whole place still stinks of dragon," he grumbled to himself, "and it makes 
line 6762=>me sick. And cram is beginning simply to stick in my throat." 
line 6763=>
line 6764=>####-<h4>Chapter 16</h4> <br> 
line 6765=>
line 6766=>A Thief in the Night 
line 6767=>
line 6768=> 
line 6769=>Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time 
line 6770=>piling  and  ordering  the  treasure;  and  now  Thorin  spoke  of  the  Arkenstone  of 
line 6771=>Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every comer.  
line 6772=>"For the Arkenstone of my father," he said, "is worth more than a river of gold 
line 6773=>in  itself,  and  to me  it  is  beyond  price.  That  stone  of  all  the  treasure  I  name  unto 
line 6774=>myself, and I will be avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds it." 
line 6775=>Bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if 
line 6776=>the stone was found-wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used as 
line 6777=>a pillow. All the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew 
line 6778=>heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his little head. 
line 6779=>Things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news that 
line 6780=>Dain and more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron Hills, were now 
line 6781=>within about two days' march of Dale, coming from the North-East. 
line 6782=>"But  they  cannot  reach  the  Mountain  unmarked,"  said  Róac,  "and  I  fear  lest 
line 6783=>there  be  battle  in  the  valley.  I  do  not  call  this  counsel  good.  Though  they  are  a 
line 6784=>grim  folk,  they  are  not  likely  to  overcome  the  host  that  besets  you;  and  even  if 
line 6785=>they  did  so, what will  you gain? Winter and snow is hastening behind them. How 
line 6786=>shall you be  fed without  the  friendship and goodwill of  the  lands about you? The 
line 6787=>treasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!"' 
line 6788=>But  Thorin  was  not moved.  "Winter  and  snow  will  bite both men and elves," 
line 6789=>he said, "and they may find their dwelling in the Waste grievous to bear. With my 
line 6790=>friends behind  them and winter upon  them,  they will perhaps be  in softer mood  to 
line 6791=>parley with." 
line 6792=>That night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky was black and moonless. As soon 
line 6793=>as  it  was  full  dark,  he  went  to  a  corner  of  an  inner  chamber  just  within  the  gate 
line 6794=>and drew from his bundle a rope, and also the Arkenstone wrapped in a rag. Then 
line 6795=>he  climbed  to  the  top  of  the  wall.  Only  Bombur  was  there,  for  it  was  his  turn to 
line 6796=>watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time. 
line 6797=>"It is mighty cold!" said Bombur. "I wish we could have a fire up here as they 
line 6798=>have in the camp!" 
line 6799=>"It is warm enough inside," said Bilbo. 
line 6800=>
line 6801=>####-"I  daresay;  but  I  am  bound  here  till  midnight,"  grumbled  the  fat  dwarf.  "A 
line 6802=>sorry  business  altogether.  Not  that  I  venture  to  disagree  with  Thorin,  may  his 
line 6803=>beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff neck." 
line 6804=>"Not as stiff as my legs," said Bilbo. "I am tired of stairs and stone passages. I 
line 6805=>would give a good deal for the feel of grass at my toes." 
line 6806=>"I would give a good deal for the feel of a strong drink in my throat, and for a 
line 6807=>soft bed after a good supper!" 
line 6808=>"I  can't  give  you  those,  while  the  siege  is  going  on.  But  it  is  long  since  I 
line 6809=>watched,  and  I  will  take  your  turn  for  you,  if  you  like.  There  is  no  sleep  in  me 
line 6810=>tonight." 
line 6811=>  "You  are  a  good  fellow,  Mr.  Baggins,  and  I  will  take  your  offer  kindly.  If 
line 6812=>there  should  be  anything  to  note,  rouse me  first, mind  you!  I will  lie  in  the  inner 
line 6813=>chamber to the left, not far away." 
line 6814=>"Off you go!" said Bilbo. "I will wake you at midnight, and you can wake the 
line 6815=>next watchman." As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on his ring, fastened his 
line 6816=>rope,  slipped  down  over  the wall,  and was  gone. He  had  about  five  hours  before 
line 6817=>him.  Bombur  would  sleep  (he  could  sleep  at  any  time,  and  ever  since  the 
line 6818=>adventure  in  the  forest he was  always  trying  to  recapture  the beautiful dreams he 
line 6819=>had then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that any, even 
line 6820=>Fili  or  Kili,  would  come out on  the wall until  it was  their  turn.  It was very dark, 
line 6821=>and  the  road  after  a  while,  when  he  left  the  newly made  path  and  climbed  down 
line 6822=>towards the lower course of the stream, was strange to him. At last he came to the 
line 6823=>bend  where  he  had  to  cross  the  water,  if  he  was  to  make  for  the  camp,  as  he 
line 6824=>wished. The bed of the stream was there shallow but already broad, and fording it 
line 6825=>in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. He was nearly across when he missed 
line 6826=>his  footing  on  a  round  stone  and  fell  into  the  cold  water  with  a  splash.  He  had 
line 6827=>barely  scrambled  out  on  the  far  bank,  shivering  and  spluttering,  when  up  came 
line 6828=>elves in the gloom with bright lanterns and searched for the cause of the noise. 
line 6829=>"That  was  no  fish!"  one  said.  "There  is  a  spy  about.  Hide  your  lights! They 
line 6830=>will help him more  than us,  if  it  is  that queer  little creature  that  is said  to be  their 
line 6831=>servant." 
line 6832=>"Servant,  indeed!"  snorted  Bilbo;  and  in  the  middle  of  his  snort  he  sneezed 
line 6833=>loudly, and the elves immediately gathered towards the sound. 
line 6834=>"Let's  have  a  light!"  he  said.  "I  am  here,  if  you want me!"  and  he  slipped  off 
line 6835=>his ring, and popped from behind a rock. 
line 6836=>
line 6837=>####-They seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. "Who are you? Are you the 
line 6838=>dwarves' hobbit? What are you doing? How did you get so far past our sentinels?" 
line 6839=>they asked one after another.  
line 6840=>"I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins," he answered, "companion of Thorin, if you want to 
line 6841=>know. I know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't know me to look 
line 6842=>at. But Bard will remember me, and it is Bard I particularly want to see." 
line 6843=>"Indeed!" said they, "and what may be your business?"  
line 6844=>"Whatever  it  is,  it's my own, my good  elves. But  if you wish  ever  to get back 
line 6845=>to  your  own  woods  from  this  cold  cheerless  place,"  he  answered  shivering,  "you 
line 6846=>will  take me  along  quiet  to a fire, where I can dry-and then you will let me speak 
line 6847=>to your chiefs as quick as may be. I have only an hour or two to spare." 
line 6848=>That is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the Gate, 
line 6849=>Bilbo  was  sitting  beside  a  warm  fire  in  front  of  a  large  tent,  and  there  sat  too, 
line 6850=>gazing curiously at him, both the Elvenking and Bard. A hobbit in elvish armour, 
line 6851=>partly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to them. 
line 6852=>"Really you know," Bilbo was  saying  in his best business manner,  "things  are 
line 6853=>impossible. Personally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I was back in the West 
line 6854=>in  my  own  home,  where  folk  are  more  reasonable.  But  I  have  an  interest  in  this 
line 6855=>matter-one  fourteenth share,  to be precise, according  to a  letter, which  fortunately 
line 6856=>I believe I have kept." He drew from a pocket in his old jacket (which he still wore 
line 6857=>over his mail), crumpled and much folded, Thorin's letter that had been put under 
line 6858=>the clock on his mantelpiece in May! 
line 6859=>"A share in the profits, mind you," he went on. "I am aware of that. Personally 
line 6860=>I am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully, and deduct what is right 
line 6861=>from  the  total  before  putting  in my  own  claim.  However  you  don't  know  Thorin 
line 6862=>Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, he is quite ready to sit on a heap of 
line 6863=>gold and starve, as long as you sit here." 
line 6864=>"Well, let him!" said Bard. "Such a fool deserves to starve." 
line 6865=>"Quite  so,"  said  Bilbo.  "I  see  your  point  of  view.  At  the  same  time  winter  is 
line 6866=>coming  on  fast. Before  long  you will  be  having  snow  and what not, and supplies 
line 6867=>will  be  difficult  –  even  for  elves  I  imagine.  Also  there  will  be  other  difficulties. 
line 6868=>You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron Hills?" 
line 6869=>"We have, a long time ago; but what has he got to do with us?" asked the king. 
line 6870=>"I  thought  as much.  I  see  I  have  some  information  you  have  not  got.  Dain,  I 
line 6871=>may  tell  you,  is  now  less  than  two  days' march  off,  and  has  at  least  five  hundred 
line 6872=>grim  dwarves  with  him  –  a  good  many  of  them  have  had  experience  in  the 
line 6873=>
line 6874=>####-dreadful  dwarf  and  goblin  wars,  of  which  you  have  no  doubt  heard. When  they 
line 6875=>arrive there may be serious trouble." 
line 6876=>"Why  do  you  tell  us  this?  Are  you  betraying  your  friends,  or  are  you 
line 6877=>threatening us?" asked Bard grimly.  
line 6878=>"My  dear  Bard!"  squeaked  Bilbo.  "Don't  be  so  hasty!  I  never  met  such 
line 6879=>suspicious folk! I am merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. Now I will 
line 6880=>make you an offer!!" 
line 6881=>"Let us hear it!" they said. 
line 6882=>"You may  see  it!"  said  he.  "It  is  this!"  and  he  drew  forth  the Arkenstone,  and 
line 6883=>threw away the wrapping. 
line 6884=>The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty, 
line 6885=>stood up in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It was as if a 
line 6886=>globe had been  filled with moonlight and hung before  them  in a net woven of  the 
line 6887=>glint of frosty stars. 
line 6888=>"This  is  the  Arkenstone  of  Thrain,"  said  Bilbo,  "the  Heart  of  the  Mountain; 
line 6889=>and  it  is  also  the  heart  of  Thorin.  He  values  it  above  a  river  of  gold.  I  give  it  to 
line 6890=>you.  It  will  aid  you  in  your  bargaining."  Then  Bilbo,  not  without  a  shudder,  not 
line 6891=>without a glance of longing, handed the marvellous stone to Bard, and he held it in 
line 6892=>his hand, as though dazed. 
line 6893=>"But how is it yours to give?" he asked at last with an effort. 
line 6894=>"O  well!"  said  the  hobbit  uncomfortably.  "It  isn't  exactly;  but,  well,  I  am 
line 6895=>willing  to  let  it  stand  against  all my claim, don't you know. I may be a burglar-or 
line 6896=>so  they  say: personally  I never  really  felt  like one-but I am an honest one, I hope, 
line 6897=>more  or  less.  Anyway  I  am  going  back  now,  and  the  dwarves  can  do  what  they 
line 6898=>like to me. I hope you will find it useful." 
line 6899=>The Elvenking looked at Bilbo with a new wonder.  
line 6900=>"Bilbo  Baggins!"  he  said.  "You  are  more  worthy  to  wear  the  armour  of  elf-
line 6901=>princes  than  many  that  have  looked  more  comely  in  it.  But  I  wonder  if  Thorin 
line 6902=>Oakenshield will see it so. I have more knowledge of dwarves  in general than you 
line 6903=>have perhaps. I advise you to remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and 
line 6904=>thrice welcome." 
line 6905=>"Thank you very much I am sure," said Bilbo with a bow. "But I don't think I 
line 6906=>ought to leave my friends like this, after all we have gone through together. And I 
line 6907=>promised  to  wake  old  Bombur  at  midnight,  too!  Really  I  must  be  going,  and 
line 6908=>quickly." 
line 6909=>Nothing  they  could  say  would  stop  him;  so  an  escort  was  provided  for  him, 
line 6910=>and  as  he  went  both  the  king  and  Bard  saluted  him  with  honour.  As  they  passed 
line 6911=>
line 6912=>####-through  the  camp  an  old  man  wrapped  in  a  dark  cloak,  rose  from  a  tent  door 
line 6913=>where he was sitting and came towards them. 
line 6914=>"Well  done!  Mr.  Baggins!"  he  said,  clapping  Bilbo  on  the  back.  "There  is 
line 6915=>always more about you than anyone expects!" It was Gandalf. 
line 6916=>For the first time for many a day Bilbo was really delighted. But there was no 
line 6917=>time for all the questions that he immediately wished to ask. 
line 6918=>"All  in  good  time!"  said  Gandalf.  "Things  are  drawing  towards  the  end  now, 
line 6919=>unless  I  am  mistaken.  There  is  an  unpleasant  time  just  in  front  of  you;  but  keep 
line 6920=>your heart up! You may  come  through  all  right. There  is news brewing  that  even 
line 6921=>the ravens have not heard. Good night!" 
line 6922=>Puzzled  but  cheered.  Bilbo  hurried  on.  He  was  guided  to  a  safe  ford  and  set 
line 6923=>across  dry,  and  then  he  said  farewell  to  the  elves  and  climbed  carefully  back 
line 6924=>towards the Gate. Great weariness began to come over him; but it was well before 
line 6925=>midnight when he  clambered up  the  rope  again  –  it was  still where he had  left  it. 
line 6926=>He untied  it and hid  it, and  then he sat down on the wall and wondered anxiously 
line 6927=>what would happen next. 
line 6928=>At  midnight  he  woke  up  Bombur;  and  then  in  turn  rolled  himself  up  in  his 
line 6929=>corner,  without  listening  to  old  dwarfs  thanks  (which  he  felt  he  had  hardly 
line 6930=>earned).  He  was  soon  fast  asleep  forgetting  all  his  worries  till  the  morning.  As 
line 6931=>matter of fact he was dreaming of eggs and bacon. 
line 6932=>
line 6933=>####-<h4>Chapter 17</h4> <br> 
line 6934=>
line 6935=>The Clouds Burst 
line 6936=>
line 6937=> 
line 6938=>Next  day  the  trumpets  rang  early  in  the  camp. Soon  a  single  runner was  seen 
line 6939=>hurrying  along  the  narrow  path.  At  a  distance  he  stood  and  hailed  them,  asking 
line 6940=>whether Thorin would now listen to another embassy, since new tidings had come 
line 6941=>to hand, and matters were changed. 
line 6942=>"That will be Dain!" said Thorin when he heard. "They will have got wind of 
line 6943=>his  coming.  I  thought  that would  alter  their mood! Bid them come few in number 
line 6944=>and weaponless, and I will hear," he called to the messenger.  
line 6945=>About  midday  the  banners  of  the  Forest  and  the  Lake  were  seen  to  be  borne 
line 6946=>forth  again.  A  company  of  twenty  was  approaching.  At  the  beginning  of  the 
line 6947=>narrow  way  they  laid  aside  sword  and  spear,  and  came  on  towards  the  Gate. 
line 6948=>Wondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both Bard and the Elvenking, 
line 6949=>before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of iron-
line 6950=>bound wood. 
line 6951=>"Hail Thorin!" said Bard. "Are you still of the same mind?" 
line 6952=>"My mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few suns," answered 
line 6953=>Thorin. "Did you come to ask me idle questions? Still the elf-host has not departed 
line 6954=>as  I  bade! Till  then  you  come  in  vain  to  bargain with me."  "Is  there  then nothing 
line 6955=>for which you would yield any of your gold?" 
line 6956=>"Nothing that you or your friends have to offer." 
line 6957=>"What of the Arkenstone of Thrain?" said he, and at the same moment the old 
line 6958=>man  opened  the  casket  and  held  aloft  the  jewel.  The  light  leapt  from  his  hand, 
line 6959=>bright and white in the morning. 
line 6960=>Then Thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. No one spoke 
line 6961=>for  a  long while. Thorin  at  length broke  the  silence,  and his voice was  thick with 
line 6962=>wrath. "That stone was my father's, and is mine," he said. "Why should I purchase 
line 6963=>my  own?"  But  wonder  overcame  him  and  he  added:  "But  how  came  you  by  the 
line 6964=>heirloom of my house-if there is need to ask such a question of thieves?" 
line 6965=>"We  are  not  thieves," Bard  answered.  "Your  own we will  give  back  in  return 
line 6966=>for our own." 
line 6967=>'How came you by it?" shouted Thorin in gathering rage. 
line 6968=>"I gave it them!" squeaked Bilbo, who was peeping over the wall, by now, in a 
line 6969=>dreadful fright. 
line 6970=>
line 6971=>####-"You!  You!"  cried  Thorin,  turning  upon  him  and  grasping  him  with  both 
line 6972=>hands.  "You  miserable  hobbit!  You  undersized-burglar!"  he  shouted  at  a  loss  for 
line 6973=>words, and he shook poor Bilbo like a rabbit. 
line 6974=>"By the beard of Durin! I wish I had Gandalf here! Curse him for his choice of 
line 6975=>you! May his beard wither! As for you I will throw you to the rocks!" he cried and 
line 6976=>lifted Bilbo in his arms. 
line 6977=>"Stay! Your wish is granted!" said a voice. The old man with the casket threw 
line 6978=>aside  his  hood  and  cloak.  "Here  is  Gandalf!  And  none  too  soon  it  seems.  If  you 
line 6979=>don't  like my Burglar, please don't damage him. Put him down,  and  listen first  to 
line 6980=>what he has to say!" 
line 6981=>"You  all  seem  in  league!"  said  Thorin  dropping  Bilbo  on  the  top  of  the wall. 
line 6982=>"Never  again will  I  have  dealings with  any wizard  or  his  friends. What  have  you 
line 6983=>to say, you descendant of rats?" 
line 6984=>"Dear  me!  Dear  me!"  said  Bilbo.  "I  am  sure  this  is  all  very  uncomfortable. 
line 6985=>You may remember saying that I might choose my own fourteenth share? Perhaps 
line 6986=>I took it too literally –1 have been told that dwarves are sometimes politer in word 
line 6987=>than  in  deed.  The  time  was,  all  the  same,  when  you  seemed  to  think  that  I  had 
line 6988=>been of some service. Descendant of rats, indeed! Is this ail the service of you and 
line 6989=>your family that I was promised. Thorin? Take it that I have disposed of my share 
line 6990=>as I wished, and let it go at that!" 
line 6991=>"I will,"  said Thorin  grimly.  "And  I will  let  you  go  at  that-and may we never 
line 6992=>meet again!" Then he turned and spoke over the wall. "I am betrayed," he said. "It 
line 6993=>was rightly guessed that I could not forbear to redeem the Arkenstone, the treasure 
line 6994=>of my house. For it I will give one fourteenth share of the hoard in silver and gold, 
line 6995=>setting  aside  the  gems;  but  that  shall  be  accounted  the  promised  share  of  this 
line 6996=>traitor, and with that reward he shall depart, and you can divide it as you will. He 
line 6997=>will  get  little  enough,  I  doubt  not.  Take  him,  if  you  wish  him  to  live;  and  no 
line 6998=>friendship of mine goes with him. 
line 6999=>"Get down now to your friends!" he said to Bilbo, "or I will throw you down." 
line 7000=>"What about the gold and silver?" asked Bilbo. 
line 7001=>"That shall follow after, as can be arranged," said he. 
line 7002=>"Get down!" 
line 7003=>"Until then we keep the stone," cried Bard. 
line 7004=>"You are not making a very splendid figure as King under the Mountain," said 
line 7005=>Gandalf. "But things may change yet." 
line 7006=>
line 7007=>####-"They may indeed," said Thorin. And already, so strong was the bewilderment 
line 7008=>of  the  treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of Dain he might 
line 7009=>not recapture the Arkenstone and withhold the share of the reward. 
line 7010=>And  so  Bilbo  was  swung  down  from  the  wall,  and  departed  with  nothing  for 
line 7011=>all his trouble, except the armour which Thorin had given him already. More than 
line 7012=>one of the dwarves 'in their hearts felt shame and pity at his going. 
line 7013=>"Farewell!" he cried to them. "We may meet again as friends." 
line 7014=>"Be  off!"  called  Thorin.  "You  have  mail  upon  you,  which  was  made  by  my 
line 7015=>folk,  and  is  too  good  for  you.  It  cannot  be  pierced  .by  arrows;  but  if  you  do  not 
line 7016=>hasten, I will sting your miserable feet. So be swift!" 
line 7017=>"Not so hasty!" said Bard. "We will give you until tomorrow. At noon we will 
line 7018=>return,  and  see  if  you  have  brought  from  the  hoard  the  portion  that  is  to  be  set 
line 7019=>against  the  stone.  If  that  is  done  without  deceit,  then  we  will  depart,  and  the  elf-
line 7020=>host will go back to the Forest. In the meanwhile farewell!" 
line 7021=>With  that  they  went  back  to  the  camp;  but  Thorin  sent  messengers  by  Róac 
line 7022=>telling Dain of what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed. 
line 7023=>That day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air 
line 7024=>was  dark  and  gloomy.  The  morning  was  still  early  when  a  cry  was  heard  in  the 
line 7025=>camp.  Runners  came  in  to  report  that  a  host  of  dwarves  had  appeared  round  the 
line 7026=>eastern spur of  the Mountain and was now hastening  to Dale. Dain had come. He 
line 7027=>had  hurried  on  through  the  night,  and  so  had  come  upon  them  sooner  than  they 
line 7028=>had expected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to 
line 7029=>his  knees,  and  his  legs were  covered with  hose  of  a  fine  and  flexible metal mesh, 
line 7030=>the secret of whose making was possessed by Dain's people. 
line 7031=>The  dwarves  are  exceedingly  strong  for  their  height,  but  most  of  these  were 
line 7032=>strong  even  for  dwarves.  In  battle  they  wielded  heavy  two-handed mattocks;  but 
line 7033=>each of  them had also a  short broad  sword at his  side and a  round  shield  slung at 
line 7034=>his  back.  Their  beards  were  forked  and  plaited  and  thrust  into  their  belts.  Their 
line 7035=>caps  were  of  iron  and  they  were  shod  with  iron,  and  their  faces  were  grim. 
line 7036=>Trumpets  called  men  and  elves  to  arms.  Before  long  the  dwarves  could  be  seen 
line 7037=>coming  up  the  valley  at  a  great  pace.  They  halted  between  the  river  and  the 
line 7038=>eastern  spur;  but  a  few  held  on  their  way,  and  crossing  the  river  drew  near  the 
line 7039=>camp;  and  there  they  laid  down  their weapons  and  held  up  their  hands  in  sign  of 
line 7040=>peace. Bard went out to meet them, and with him went Bilbo. 
line 7041=>"We  are  sent  from  Dain  son  of  Nain,"  they  said  when  questioned.  "We  are 
line 7042=>hastening  to our kinsmen  in  the Mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old 
line 7043=>is  renewed. But who  are  you  that  sit  in  the  plain  as  foes  before  defended walls?" 
line 7044=>
line 7045=>####-This, of. course, in the polite and rather old-fashioned language of such occasions, 
line 7046=>meant simply: "You have no business  here. We are going on, so make way or we 
line 7047=>shall fight you!" They meant to push on between the Mountain and the loop of the 
line 7048=>river, for the narrow land there did not seem to be strongly guarded. 
line 7049=>Bard,  of  course,  refused  to  allow  the  dwarves  to  go  straight  on  to  the 
line 7050=>Mountain. He was  determined  to wait  until  the  gold  and  silver  had  been  brought 
line 7051=>out in exchange for the Arkenstone: for he did not believe that this would be done, 
line 7052=>if  once  the  fortress  was manned  with  so  large  and  warlike  a  company.  They  had 
line 7053=>brought with  them a great store of supplies; for  the dwarves can carry very heavy 
line 7054=>burdens,  and  nearly  all  of  Dain's  folks,  in  spite  of  their  rapid  march,  bore  huge 
line 7055=>packs  on  their  backs  in  addition  to  their  weapons.  They  would  stand  a  siege  for 
line 7056=>weeks,  and  by  that  time yet more dwarves might  come,  and yet more,  for Thorin 
line 7057=>had many relatives. Also they would be able to reopen and guard some other gate, 
line 7058=>so that the besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they 
line 7059=>had not sufficient numbers. 
line 7060=>These  were,  in  fact,  precisely  their  plans  (for  the  raven-messengers  had  been 
line 7061=>busy between Thorin and Dain); but  for  the moment  the way was barred, so after 
line 7062=>angry  words  the  dwarf-messengers  retired  muttering  in  their  beards.  Bard  then 
line 7063=>sent messengers  at  once  to  the Gate; but  they  found no gold or payment. Arrows 
line 7064=>came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay. In 
line 7065=>the  camp  all  was  now  astir,  as  if  for  battle;  for  the  dwarves  of  Dain  were 
line 7066=>advancing along the eastern bank. 
line 7067=>"Fools!"  laughed  Bard,  "to  come  thus  beneath  the  Mountain's  arm!  They  do 
line 7068=>not understand war above ground, whatever they may know of battle in the mines. 
line 7069=>There  are many  of  our  archers  and  spearmen  now  hidden  in  the  rocks  upon  their 
line 7070=>right  flank. Dwarf-mail may  be  good,  but  they will  soon be hard put  to  it. Let us 
line 7071=>set on them now from both sides, before they are fully rested!" 
line 7072=>But  the  Elvenking  said:  "Long will  I  tarry,  ere  I  begin  this war  for  gold.  The 
line 7073=>dwarves cannot press us, unless we will, or do anything  that we cannot mark. Let 
line 7074=>us  hope  still  for  something  that  will  bring  reconciliation.  Our  advantage  in 
line 7075=>numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy blows." 
line 7076=>But he reckoned without the dwarves. The knowledge that the Arkenstone was 
line 7077=>in  the  hands  of  the  besiegers  burned  in  their  thoughts;  also  they  guessed  the 
line 7078=>hesitation of Bard and his friends, and resolved to strike while they debated. 
line 7079=>Suddenly  without  a  signal  they  sprang  silently  forward  to  attack.  Bows 
line 7080=>twanged and arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined. 
line 7081=>
line 7082=>####-Still  more  suddenly  a  darkness  came  on  with  dreadful  swiftness!  A  black 
line 7083=>cloud  hurried  over  the  sky. Winter  thunder  on  a wild wind  rolled  roaring  up  and 
line 7084=>rumbled  in  the  Mountain,  and  lightning  lit  its  peak.  And  beneath  the  thunder 
line 7085=>another  blackness  could  be  seen  whirling  forward;  but  it  did  not  come  with  the 
line 7086=>wind,  it  came  from  the  North,  like  a  vast  cloud  of  birds,  so  dense  that  no  light 
line 7087=>could be seen between their wings. 
line 7088=>"Halt!"  cried  Gandalf,  who  appeared  suddenly,  and  stood  alone,  with  arms 
line 7089=>uplifted, between  the advancing dwarves and  the  ranks awaiting  them. "Halt!" he 
line 7090=>called  in  a  voice  like  thunder,  and  his  staff  blazed  forth  with  a  flash  like  the 
line 7091=>lightning.  "Dread  has  come  upon  you  all!  Alas!  it  has  come  more  swiftly  than  I 
line 7092=>guessed. The Goblins  are upon you! Bolg*  of the North is coming. O Dain! whose 
line 7093=>father  you  slew  in  Moria.  Behold!  the  bats  are  above  his  army  like  a  sea  of 
line 7094=>locusts. They ride upon wolves and Wargs are in their train!" 
line 7095=>Amazement  and  confusion  fell  upon  them  all.  Even  as  Gandalf  had  been 
line 7096=>speaking  the  darkness  grew.  The  dwarves  halted  and  gazed  at  the  sky.  The  elves 
line 7097=>cried out with many voices. 
line 7098=>"Come!" called Gandalf.  "There  is yet  time  for council. Let Dain  son of Nain 
line 7099=>come swiftly to us!" 
line 7100=> 
line 7101=>So  began  a  battle  that  none  had  expected; and  it was called  the Battle of Five 
line 7102=>Armies,  and  it  was  very  terrible.  Upon  one  side  were  the  Goblins  and  the  wild 
line 7103=>Wolves, and upon  the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This  is how  it  fell 
line 7104=>out.  Ever  since  the  fall  of  the Great Goblin  of  the Misty Mountains  the hatred of 
line 7105=>their  race  for  the  dwarves  had  been  rekindled  to  fury. Messengers  had  passed  to 
line 7106=>and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to 
line 7107=>win  the  dominion  of  the  North.  Tidings  they  had  gathered  in  secret  ways; and  in 
line 7108=>all  the  mountains  there  was  a  forging  and  an  arming.  Then  they  marched  and 
line 7109=>gathered by hill  and valley, going  ever by  tunnel or under dark, until  around  and 
line 7110=>beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, a vast 
line 7111=>host  was  assembled  ready  to  sweep  down  in  time  of  storm  unawares  upon  the 
line 7112=>South. Then  they  learned of  the death of Smaug,  and  joy was  in  their hearts:  and 
line 7113=>they hastened night  after night  through  the mountains,  and  came  thus  at  last on  a 
line 7114=>sudden  from  the  North  hard  on  the  heels  of  Dain.  Not  even  the  ravens  knew  of 
line 7115=>their  coming  until  they  came  out  in  the  broken  lands  which  divided  the  Lonely 
line 7116=>Mountain from the hills behind. How much Gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is 
line 7117=>plain that he had not expected this sudden assault. 
line 7118=>
line 7119=>                                                             
line 7120=>*
line 7121=> Son of Azog 
line 7122=>
line 7123=>####-This is the plan that he made in council with the Elvenking and with Bard; and 
line 7124=>with  Dain,  for  the  dwarf-lord  now  joined  them:  the  Goblins  were  the  foes  of  all, 
line 7125=>and at  their coming all other quarrels were  forgotten. Their only hope was  to  lure 
line 7126=>the  goblins  into  the  valley  between  the  arms  of  the Mountain;  and  themselves  to 
line 7127=>man  the  great  spurs  that  struck  south  and  east. Yet  this would  be  perilous,  if  the 
line 7128=>goblins  were  in  sufficient  numbers  to  overrun  the  Mountain  itself,  and  so  attack 
line 7129=>them also  from behind and above; but there was no time for make any other plan, 
line 7130=>or to summon any help. 
line 7131=>Soon  the  thunder  passed,  rolling  away  to  the  South-East;  but  the  bat-cloud 
line 7132=>came,  flying  lower,  over  the  shoulder  of  the  Mountain,  and  whirled  above  them 
line 7133=>shutting out the light and filling them with dread. 
line 7134=>"To  the  Mountain!"  called  Bard.  "To  the  Mountain!  Let  us  take  our  places 
line 7135=>while there is yet time!" 
line 7136=>On  the Southern spur,  in  its  lower slopes and  in  the  rocks at  its  feet,  the Elves 
line 7137=>were  set;  on  the  Eastern  spur  were men  and  dwarves.  But  Bard  and  some  of  the 
line 7138=>nimblest of men and elves climbed  to  the height of  the Eastern  shoulder  to gain a 
line 7139=>view  to  the North. Soon  they could see  the  lands before  the Mountain's  feet black 
line 7140=>with a hurrying multitude. Ere long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and 
line 7141=>came  rushing  into  Dale.  These  were  the  swiftest  wolf-riders,  and  already  their 
line 7142=>cries  and  howls  rent  the  air  afar.  A  few  brave  men  were  strung  before  them  to 
line 7143=>make  a  feint  of  resistance,  and many  there  fell  before  the  rest  drew  back  and fled 
line 7144=>to  either  side.  As  Gandalf  had  hoped,  the  goblin  army  had  gathered  behind  the 
line 7145=>resisted  vanguard,  and  poured  now  in  rage  into  the  valley,  driving  wildly  up 
line 7146=>between  the  arms  of  the  Mountain,  seeking  for  the  foe.  Their  banners  were 
line 7147=>countless, black and red, and they came on like a tide in fury and disorder.  
line 7148=>It  was  a  terrible  battle.  The  most  dreadful  of  all  Bilbo's  experiences,  and  the 
line 7149=>one which  at  the  time he hated most  – which is to say it was the one he was most 
line 7150=>proud  of,  and  most  fond  of  recalling  long  afterwards,  although  he  was  quite 
line 7151=>unimportant in it. Actually I must say he put on his ring early in the business, and 
line 7152=>vanished  from  sight,  if  not  from  all  danger.  A  magic  ring  of  that  sort  is  not  a 
line 7153=>complete  protection  in  a  goblin  charge,  nor  does  it  stop  flying  arrows  and  wild 
line 7154=>spears;  but  it  does  help  in  getting  out  of  the way,  and  it  prevents  your  head  from 
line 7155=>being specially chosen for a sweeping stroke by a goblin swordsman. 
line 7156=>The  elves  were  the  first  to  charge.  Their  hatred  for  the  goblins  is  cold  and 
line 7157=>bitter. Their spears and swords shone  in  the gloom with a gleam of chill flame, so 
line 7158=>deadly  was  the  wrath  of  the  hands  that  held  them.  As  soon  as  the  host  of  their 
line 7159=>enemies was dense  in  the valley,  they sent against  it a shower of arrows, and each 
line 7160=>
line 7161=>####-flickered  as  it  fled  as  if with  stinging  fire.  Behind  the  arrows  a  thousand  of  their 
line 7162=>spearmen  leapt  down  and  charged.  The  yells  were  deafening.  The  rocks  were 
line 7163=>stained  black  with  goblin  blood.  Just  as  the  goblins  were  recovering  from  the 
line 7164=>onslaught  and  the  elf-charge was halted,  there  rose  from across  the valley a deep-
line 7165=>throated  roar. With  cries  of  "Moria!"  and  "Dain,  Dain!"  the  dwarves  of  the  Iron 
line 7166=>Hills  plunged  in,  wielding  their  mattocks,  upon  the  other  side;  and  beside  them 
line 7167=>came  the  men  of  the  Lake  with  long  swords.  Panic  came  upon  the Goblins;  and 
line 7168=>even as they turned to meet this new attack, the elves charged again with renewed 
line 7169=>numbers. Already many of  the goblins were  flying back down  the  river  to  escape 
line 7170=>from the trap: and many of their own wolves were turning upon them and rending 
line 7171=>the  dead  and  the  wounded.  Victory  seemed  at  hand,  when  a  cry  rang  out  on  the 
line 7172=>heights above. 
line 7173=>Goblins  had  scaled  the Mountain  from  the  other  side  and  already many were 
line 7174=>on the slopes above the Gate, and others were streaming down recklessly, heedless 
line 7175=>of  those  that  fell  screaming  from  cliff  and  precipice,  to  attack  the  spurs  from 
line 7176=>above. Each of these could be reached by paths that ran down from the main mass 
line 7177=>of  the Mountain  in  the  centre;  and  the  defenders  had  too  few  to  bar  the  way  for 
line 7178=>long. Vi ctory now vanished from hope. They had only stemmed the first onslaught 
line 7179=>of the black tide. 
line 7180=>Day drew on. The goblins gathered again  in  the valley. There a host of Wargs 
line 7181=>came  ravening  and  with  them  came  the  bodyguard  of  Bolg,  goblins  of  huge  size 
line 7182=>with scimitars of steel. Soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while 
line 7183=>still  the great bats  swirled  about  the heads  and  ears of  elves  and men, or  fastened 
line 7184=>vampire-like  on  the  stricken.  Now  Bard  was  fighting  to  defend  the  Eastern  spur, 
line 7185=>and yet giving slowly back; and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the 
line 7186=>southern arm, near to the watch-post on Ravenhill. 
line 7187=>Suddenly  there  was  a  great  shout,  and  from  the  Gate  came  a  trumpet  call. 
line 7188=>They had forgotten Thorin! Part of  the wall, moved by  levers, fell outward with a 
line 7189=>crash  into  the  pool. Out  leapt  the King  under  the Mountain,  and  his  companions 
line 7190=>followed  him.  Hood  and  cloak  were  gone;  they  were  in  shining  armour,  and  red 
line 7191=>light  leapt  from  their  eyes.  In  the  gloom  the  great  dwarf  gleamed  like  gold  in  a 
line 7192=>dying fire. 
line 7193=>Rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on. 
line 7194=>leapt  down  to  the  falls'  foot,  and  rushed  forward  to  battle. Wolf  and  rider  fell  or 
line 7195=>fled before them. Thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed 
line 7196=>to harm him. 
line 7197=>
line 7198=>####-"To  me!  To  me!  Elves  and  Men!  To  me!  O  my  kinsfolk!"  he  cried,  and  his 
line 7199=>voice shook like a horn in the valley.  
line 7200=>Down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of Dain to his help. Down too 
line 7201=>came  many  of  the  Lake-men,  for Bard  could  not  restrain  them;  and out upon  the 
line 7202=>other  side  came many  of  the  spearmen  of  the  elves. Once  again  the  goblins were 
line 7203=>stricken in the valley; and they were piled in heaps till Dale was dark and hideous 
line 7204=>with  their  corpses.  The  Wargs  were  scattered  and  Thorin  drove  right  against  the 
line 7205=>bodyguards  of  Bolg.  But  he  could  not  pierce  their  ranks.  Already  behind  him 
line 7206=>among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many a fair elf that 
line 7207=>should  have  lived  yet  long  ages  merrily  in  the  wood.  And  as  the  valley  widened 
line 7208=>his onset grew ever slower. His numbers were too few. His flanks were unguarded. 
line 7209=>Soon  the  attackers  were  attacked,  and  they  were  forced  into  a  great  ring,  facing 
line 7210=>every  way,  hemmed  all  about  with  goblins  and  wolves  returning  to  the  assault. 
line 7211=>The bodyguard of Bolg came howling against them, and drove in upon their ranks 
line 7212=>like waves  upon  cliffs  of  sand.  Their  friends  could  not  help  them,  for  the  assault 
line 7213=>from  the Mountain was  renewed with  redoubled  force,  and  upon  either  side men 
line 7214=>and elves were being slowly beaten down. 
line 7215=>On  all  this  Bilbo  looked  with  misery.  He  had  taken  his  stand  on  Ravenhill 
line 7216=>among  the Elves-partly because  there was more chance of escape from  that point, 
line 7217=>and partly (with the more Tookish part of his mind) because if he was going to be 
line 7218=>in  a  last  desperate  stand,  he  preferred  on  the  whole  to  defend  the  Elvenking. 
line 7219=>Gandalf,  too,  I  may  say,  was  there,  sitting  on  the  ground  as  if  in  deep  thought, 
line 7220=>preparing,  I  suppose,  some  last  blast  of magic  before  the  end.  That  did  not  seem 
line 7221=>far off. "It will not be  long now,"  thought Bilbo, "before the goblins win the Gate, 
line 7222=>and  we  are  all  slaughtered  or  driven  down  and  captured.  Really  it  is  enough  to 
line 7223=>make  one  weep,  after  all  one  has  gone  through.  I  would  rather  old  Smaug  had 
line 7224=>been left with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, 
line 7225=>and  poor  old Bombur,  and Balin  and  Fili  and Kili  and  all  the  rest  come  to  a  bad 
line 7226=>end;  and  Bard  too,  and  the  Lake-men  and  the  merry  elves.  Misery  me!  I  have 
line 7227=>heard  songs  of  many  battles,  and  I  have  always  understood  that  defeat  may  be 
line 7228=>glorious. It seems very uncomfortable, not to say distressing. I wish I was well out 
line 7229=>of it." 
line 7230=>The  clouds  were  torn  by  the  wind,  and  a  red  sunset  slashed  the West.  Seeing 
line 7231=>the  sudden  gleam  in  the  gloom  Bilbo  looked  round. He  gave  a  great  cry:  he  had 
line 7232=>seen  a  sight  that  made  his  heart  leap,  dark  shapes  small  yet  majestic  against  the 
line 7233=>distant glow.  
line 7234=>"The Eagles! The Eagles!" he shouted. "The Eagles are coming!" 
line 7235=>
line 7236=>####-Bilbo's eyes were seldom wrong. The eagles were coming down the wind, line 
line 7237=>after line, in such a host as must have gathered from all the eyries of the North. 
line 7238=>"The  Eagles!  the  Eagles!"  Bilbo  cried,  dancing  and  waving  his  arms.  If  the 
line 7239=>elves could not see him they could hear him. Soon they too took up the cry, and it 
line 7240=>echoed  across  the  valley. Many wondering  eyes  looked up,  though as yet nothing 
line 7241=>could be seen except from the southern shoulders of the Mountain. 
line 7242=>"The Eagles!" cried Bilbo once more, but at that moment a stone hurtling from 
line 7243=>above smote heavily on his helm, and he fell with a crash and knew no more. 
line 7244=>
line 7245=>####-<h4>Chapter 18</h4> <br> 
line 7246=>
line 7247=>The Return Journey 
line 7248=>
line 7249=> 
line 7250=>When Bilbo came  to himself, he was  literally by himself. He was  lying on  the 
line 7251=>flat stones of Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was broad 
line 7252=>above him. He was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned with fire. 
line 7253=>"Now I wonder what has happened?" he said to himself. "At any rate I am not 
line 7254=>yet one of the fallen heroes; but I suppose there is still time enough for that!" 
line 7255=>He  sat  up  painfully.  Looking  into  the  valley  he  could  see  no  living  goblins. 
line 7256=>After  a while as his head cleared a  little, he  thought he could see elves moving  in 
line 7257=>the  rocks  below.  He  rubbed  his  eyes.  Surely  there  was  a  camp  still  in  the  plain 
line 7258=>some  distance  off;  and  there  was  a  coming  and  going  about  the  Gate?  Dwarves 
line 7259=>seemed  to  be  busy  removing  the wall. But  all was deadly  still. There was no  call 
line 7260=>and  no  echo  of  a  song.  Sorrow  seemed  to  be  in  the  air.  "Victory  after  all,  I 
line 7261=>suppose!"  he  said,  feeling  his  aching  head.  "Well,  it  seems  a  very  gloomy 
line 7262=>business." 
line 7263=>Suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him. 
line 7264=>"Hullo there!" he called with a shaky voice. "Hullo there! What news?" 
line 7265=>"What  voice  is  it  that  speaks  among  the  stones?"  said  the  man  halting  and 
line 7266=>peering about him not far from where Bilbo sat. 
line 7267=>Then Bilbo remembered his ring! "Well I'm blessed!" said he. "This invisibility 
line 7268=>has  its  drawbacks  after  all.  Otherwise  I  suppose  I  might  have  spent  a  warm  and 
line 7269=>comfortable night in bed!" 
line 7270=>"It's me, Bilbo Baggins,  companion  of Thorin!"  he  cried,  hurriedly  taking  off 
line 7271=>the ring. 
line 7272=>"It  is  well  that  I  have  found  you!"  said  the  man  striding  forward.  "You  are 
line 7273=>needed and we have looked for you long. You would have been numbered among 
line 7274=>the  dead,  who  are many,  if  Gandalf  the  wizard  had  not  said  that  your  voice  was 
line 7275=>last  heard  in  this  place.  I  have  been  sent  to  look  here  for  the  last  time.  Are  you 
line 7276=>much hurt?" 
line 7277=>"A  nasty  knock  on  the  head,  I  think,"  said  Bilbo.  "But  I  have  a  helm  and  a 
line 7278=>hard skull. All the same I feel sick and my legs are like straws." 
line 7279=>"I  will  carry  you  down  to  the  camp  in  the  valley,"  said  the man,  and  picked 
line 7280=>him lightly up. 
line 7281=>The man was swift and sure-footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set down 
line 7282=>before  a  tent  in Dale;  and  there  stood Gandalf, with  his  arm  in  a  sling.  Even  the 
line 7283=>
line 7284=>####-wizard had not escaped without a wound; and  there were  few unharmed in all the 
line 7285=>host. 
line 7286=>When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted. "Baggins!" he exclaimed. "Well I 
line 7287=>never! Alive after all – 1 am glad! I began to wonder if even your luck would see 
line 7288=>you through! A terrible business, and it nearly was disastrous. But other news can 
line 7289=>wait. Come!" he said more gravely. "You are called for;" and leading the hobbit he 
line 7290=>took him within the tent. 
line 7291=>"Hail! Thorin," he said as he entered. "I have brought him." 
line 7292=>There  indeed  lay  Thorin  Oakenshield,  wounded  with  many  wounds,  and  his 
line 7293=>rent  armour  and  notched  axe  were  cast  upon  the  floor.  He  looked  up  as  Bilbo 
line 7294=>came beside him. 
line 7295=>"Farewell,  good  thief,"  he  said.  "I  go  now  to  the  halls  of waiting  to  sit  beside 
line 7296=>my  fathers,  until  the world  is  renewed. Since  I  leave  now  all  gold  and  silver,  and 
line 7297=>go  where  it  is  of  little  worth,  I  wish  to  part  in  friendship  from  you,  and  I  would 
line 7298=>take back my words and deeds at the Gate." 
line 7299=>Bilbo  knelt  on  one  knee  filled  with  sorrow.  "Farewell,  King  under  the 
line 7300=>Mountain!"  he  said.  "This  is  a  bitter  adventure,  if  it  must  end  so;  and  not  a 
line 7301=>mountain  of  gold  can  amend  it. Yet  I  am  glad  that  I  have  shared  in  your  perils  – 
line 7302=>that has been more than any Baggins deserves." 
line 7303=>"No!" said Thorin. "There  is more  in you of good  than you know, child of  the 
line 7304=>kindly West. Some  courage  and  some wisdom, blended  in measure.  If more of us 
line 7305=>valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. 
line 7306=>But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!" 
line 7307=>Then Bilbo  turned  away,  and  he went  by  himself,  and  sat  alone wrapped  in  a 
line 7308=>blanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and his 
line 7309=>voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long before he had the 
line 7310=>heart to make a joke again. "A mercy it is," he said at last to himself, "that I woke 
line 7311=>up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we parted in kindness. 
line 7312=>You  are  a  fool,  Bilbo  Baggins,  and  you made  a  great mess  of  that  business with 
line 7313=>the stone; and there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, 
line 7314=>but I suppose you can hardly be blamed for that." 
line 7315=>All  that  had  happened  after  he  was  stunned,  Bilbo  learned  later;  but  it  gave 
line 7316=>him more sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching 
line 7317=>in  his  bones  for  the  homeward  journey. That,  however, was  a  little  delayed, so  in 
line 7318=>the meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion of 
line 7319=>the  goblins'  mustering;  from  their  watchfulness  the  movements  in  the  mountains 
line 7320=>could not be altogether hid. So  they  too had gathered  in great numbers, under  the 
line 7321=>
line 7322=>####-great  Eagle  of  the Misty Mountains;  and  at  length  smelling  battle  from  afar  they 
line 7323=>had come  speeding down  the gale  in  the nick of  time. They  it was who dislodged 
line 7324=>the  goblins  from  the  mountain-slopes,  casting  them  over  precipices,  or  driving 
line 7325=>them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It was not long before they 
line 7326=>had  freed  the  Lonely  Mountain,  and  elves  and  men  on  either  side  of  the  valley 
line 7327=>could come at last to the help of the battle below.  
line 7328=>But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered. 
line 7329=>In  that  last  hour  Beorn  himself  had  appeared  –  no  one  knew  how  or  from 
line 7330=>where. He  came  alone,  and  in  bear's  shape;  and  he  seemed  to  have  grown  almost 
line 7331=>to  giant-size  in  his wrath. The  roar  of  his  voice was  like  drums  and  guns;  and  he 
line 7332=>tossed  wolves  and  goblins  from  his  path  like  straws  and  feathers.  He  fell  upon 
line 7333=>their  rear,  and  broke  like  a  clap  of  thunder  through  the  ring.  The  dwarves  were 
line 7334=>making  a  stand  still  about  their  lords  upon  a  low  rounded  hill.  Then  Beorn 
line 7335=>stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of 
line 7336=>the  fray.  Swiftly  he  returned  and  his  wrath  was  redoubled,  so  that  nothing  could 
line 7337=>withstand  him,  and  no  weapon  seemed  to  bite  upon  him.  He  scattered  the 
line 7338=>bodyguard,  and  pulled  down Bolg  himself  and  crushed  him. Then  dismay  fell  on 
line 7339=>the  Goblins  and  they  fled  in  all  directions.  But  weariness  left  their  enemies  with 
line 7340=>the  coming  of  new  hope,  and  they  pursued  them  closely,  and  prevented  most  of 
line 7341=>them from escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the Running 
line 7342=>River, and such as fled south or west they hunted into the marshes about the Forest 
line 7343=>River;  and  there  the  greater  part  of  the  last  fugitives  perished,  while  those  that 
line 7344=>came  hardly  to  the Wood-elves'  realm  were  there  slain,  or  drawn  in  to  die  in  the 
line 7345=>trackless  dark  of  Mirkwood.  Songs  have  said  that  three  parts  of  the  goblin 
line 7346=>warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many 
line 7347=>a year.  
line 7348=>Victory  had  been  assured  before  the  fall  of  night,  but  the  pursuit  was  still  on 
line 7349=>foot, when  Bilbo  returned  to  the  camp;  and not many were  in  the valley  save  the 
line 7350=>more grievously wounded. 
line 7351=>"Where are  the Eagles?" he asked Gandalf  that evening, as he  lay wrapped  in 
line 7352=>many warm blankets. 
line 7353=>"Some  are  in  the  hunt,"  said  the  wizard,  "but  most  have  gone  back  to  their 
line 7354=>eyries.  They  would  not  stay  here,  and  departed  with  the  first  light  of  morning. 
line 7355=>Dain has crowned their chief with gold, and sworn friendship with them for ever." 
line 7356=>"I  am  sorry.  I  mean,  I  should  have  liked  to  see  them  again,"  said  Bilbo 
line 7357=>sleepily;  "perhaps  I  shall  see  them  on  the  way  home.  I  suppose  I  shall  be  going 
line 7358=>home soon?" 
line 7359=>
line 7360=>####-"As soon as you like," said the wizard. 
line 7361=>Actually it was some days before Bilbo really set out. 
line 7362=>They buried Thorin deep beneath the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone 
line 7363=>upon his breast. 
line 7364=>"There let it lie till the Mountain falls!" he said. "May it bring good fortune to 
line 7365=>all his  folk  that dwell here after!" Upon his  tomb  the Elvenking  then  laid Orcrist, 
line 7366=>the  elvish  sword  that  had  been  taken  from  Thorin  in  captivity.  It  is  said  in  songs 
line 7367=>that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves 
line 7368=>could  not  be  taken  by  surprise.  There  now  Dain  son  of  Nain  took  up  his  abode, 
line 7369=>and  he  became  King  under  the  Mountain,  and  in  time  many  other  dwarves 
line 7370=>gathered  to  his  throne  in  the  ancient  halls.  Of  the  twelve  companions  of  Thorin, 
line 7371=>ten  remained. Fili  and Kili  had  fallen  defending  him with  shield  and  body,  for  he 
line 7372=>was their mother's elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his 
line 7373=>treasure well. There was,  of  course,  no  longer  any  question of dividing  the hoard 
line 7374=>in  such  shares  as had been planned,  to Balin  and Dwalin,  and Dori  and Nori  and 
line 7375=>Ori,  and  Oin  and  Gloin,  and  Bifur  and  Bofur  and  Bombur-or  to  Bilbo.  Yet  a 
line 7376=>fourteenth  share of  all  the  silver  and gold, wrought  and unwrought, was given up 
line 7377=>to  Bard;  for  Dain  said:  "We  will  honour  the  agreement  of  the  dead,  and  he  has 
line 7378=>now the Arkenstone in his keeping." 
line 7379=>Even  a  fourteenth  share  was  wealth  exceedingly  great,  greater  than  that  of 
line 7380=>many  mortal  kings.  From  that  treasure  Bard  sent  much  gold  to  the  Master  of 
line 7381=>Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers and friends freely. To the Elvenking he 
line 7382=>gave  the  emeralds  of  Girion,  such  jewels  as  he  most  loved,  which  Dain  had 
line 7383=>restored  to  him.  To  Bilbo  he  said:  "This  treasure  is  as  much  yours  as  it  is  mine; 
line 7384=>though  old  agreements  cannot  stand,  since  so  many  have  a  claim  in  its  winning 
line 7385=>and  defence.  Yet  even  though  you  were  willing  to  lay  aside  all  your  claim,  I 
line 7386=>should wish that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not prove true: 
line 7387=>that we should give you little. I would reward you most richly of all." 
line 7388=>"Very  kind  of  you,"  said  Bilbo.  "But  really  it  is  a  relief  to me. How  on  earth 
line 7389=>should  I  have  got  all  that  treasure  home  without  war  and  murder  all  along  the 
line 7390=>way,  I  don't  know. And  I  don't  know what  I  should  have done with  it when  I got 
line 7391=>home. I am sure it is better in your hands." 
line 7392=>In  the end he would only  take  two  small chests, one  filled with  silver, and  the 
line 7393=>other with gold, such as one strong pony could carry. "That will be quite as much 
line 7394=>as I can manage," said he. 
line 7395=>At last the time came for him to say good-bye to his friends. "Farewell, Balin!" 
line 7396=>he  said;  "and  farewell,  Dwalin;  and  farewell  Dori,  Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  Gloin,  Bifur, 
line 7397=>
line 7398=>####-Bofur, and Bombur! May your beards never grow  thin!" And  turning  towards  the 
line 7399=>Mountain  he added: "Farewell Thorin Oakenshield! And Fili and Kili! May your 
line 7400=>memory never fade!" 
line 7401=>Then  the  dwarves  bowed  low  before  their  Gate,  but  words  stuck  in  their 
line 7402=>throats.  "Good-bye and good luck, wherever you fare!" said Balin at last. "If ever 
line 7403=>you  visit  us  again,  when  our  halls  are  made  fair  once  more,  then  the  feast  shall 
line 7404=>indeed be splendid!" 
line 7405=>"If  ever  you  are  passing my way,"  said Bilbo,  "don't wait  to  knock!  Tea  is  at 
line 7406=>four; but any of you are welcome at any time!" 
line 7407=>Then he turned away.  
line 7408=>The  elf-host  was  on  the  march;.  and  if  it  was  sadly  lessened,  yet  many  were 
line 7409=>glad,  for  now  the  northern  world  would  be  merrier  for  many  a  long  day.  The 
line 7410=>dragon  was  dead,  and  the  goblins  overthrown,  and  their  hearts  looked  forward 
line 7411=>after winter  to  a  spring  of  joy. Gandalf  and Bilbo  rode behind the Elvenking, and 
line 7412=>beside  them strode Beorn, once again  in man's shape, and he  laughed and sang  in 
line 7413=>a loud voice upon the road. So they went on until they drew near to the borders of 
line 7414=>Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out. 
line 7415=>Then  they  halted,  for  the  wizard  and  Bilbo  would  not  enter  the  wood,  even 
line 7416=>though the king bade them stay a while in his halls. They intended to go along the 
line 7417=>edge of  the  forest, and  round  its northern end  in  the waste  that  lay between  it and 
line 7418=>the  beginning  of  the  Grey Mountains.  It  was  a  long  and  cheerless  road,  but  now 
line 7419=>that  the goblins were crushed,  it seemed safer  to  them  than  the dreadful pathways 
line 7420=>under the trees. Moreover Beorn was going that way too. 
line 7421=>"Farewell!  O  Elvenking!"  said  Gandalf.  "Merry  be  the  greenwood, while  the 
line 7422=>world is yet young! And merry be all your folk!" 
line 7423=>"Farewell!  O  Gandalf!"  said  the  king.  "May  you  ever  appear  where  you  are 
line 7424=>most  needed  and  least  expected!  The  oftener  you  appear  in  my  halls  the  better 
line 7425=>shall I be pleased!" 
line 7426=>"I beg of  you," said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, "to accept this 
line 7427=>gift!" and he brought out a necklace of  silver and pearls  that Dain had given him 
line 7428=>at their parting. 
line 7429=>"In what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?" said the king. 
line 7430=>"Well,  er,  I  thought,  don't  you  know,"  said  Bilbo  rather  confused,  "that,  er, 
line 7431=>some  little  return  should  be made  for  your,  er,  hospitality.  I mean  even  a  burglar 
line 7432=>has his feelings. I have drunk much of your wine and eaten much of your bread." 
line 7433=>
line 7434=>####-"I will  take your gift, O Bilbo  the Magnificent!" said the king gravely. "And I 
line 7435=>name  you  elf-friend  and  blessed. May  your  shadow  never  grow  less  (or  stealing 
line 7436=>would be too easy)! Farewell!" 
line 7437=>Then  the  elves  turned  towards  the  Forest,  and  Bilbo  started  on  his  long  road 
line 7438=>home. 
line 7439=>He had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still 
line 7440=>the Wild, and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins; but 
line 7441=>he  was  well  guided  and  well  guarded-the  wizard  was  with  him,  and  Beorn  for 
line 7442=>much  of  the way-and  he was  never  in  great danger again. Anyway by mid-winter 
line 7443=>Gandalf  and Bilbo had  come  all  the way back,  along both  edges of  the Forest,  to 
line 7444=>the  doors  of Beorn's  house;  and  there  for  a while  they  both  stayed. Yule-tide was 
line 7445=>warm  and  merry  there;  and  men  came  from  far  and  wide  to  feast  at  Beorn's 
line 7446=>bidding.  The  goblins  of  the  Misty  Mountains  were  now  few  and  terrified,  and 
line 7447=>hidden  in  the deepest holes  they could  find; and  the Wargs had vanished  from  the 
line 7448=>woods,  so  that men went  abroad without  fear. Beorn  indeed became  a great  chief 
line 7449=>afterwards  in  those  regions  and  ruled  a wide  land between  the mountains  and  the 
line 7450=>wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of 
line 7451=>taking bear's shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like 
line 7452=>Beorn,  if  less  in  size  and  strength.  In  their  day  the  last  goblins were  hunted  from 
line 7453=>the  Misty  Mountains  and  a  new  peace  came  over  the  edge  of  the  Wild.  It  was 
line 7454=>spring,  and  a  fair  one  with  mild  weathers  and  a  bright  sun,  before  Bilbo  and 
line 7455=>Gandalf  took  their  leave  at  last  of Beorn,  and  though  he  longed  for  home. Bilbo 
line 7456=>left with regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were m springtime no less 
line 7457=>marvellous  than  in high summer. At  last  they came up  the  long road, and reached 
line 7458=>the  very  pass  where  the  goblins  had  captured  them before. But  they came  to  that 
line 7459=>high  point  at morning,  and  looking  backward  they  saw  a  white  sun  shining  over 
line 7460=>the  out-stretched  lands.  There  behind  lay  Mirkwood,  blue  in  the  distance,  and 
line 7461=>darkly green at the nearer edge even in the spring. There far away was the Lonely 
line 7462=>Mountain  on  the  edge  of  eyesight.  On  its  highest  peak  snow  yet  unmelted  was 
line 7463=>gleaming pale. 
line 7464=>"So  comes  snow  after  fire,  and  even  dragons  have  their  ending!"  said  Bilbo, 
line 7465=>and he  turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish part was getting very tired, 
line 7466=>and  the  Baggins  was  daily  getting  stronger.  "I  wish  now  only  to  be  in  my  own 
line 7467=>arm-chair!" he said. 
line 7468=>
line 7469=>####-<h4>Chapter 19</h4> <br> 
line 7470=>
line 7471=>The Last Stage 
line 7472=>
line 7473=> 
line 7474=>It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley 
line 7475=>of  Rivendell,  where  stood  the  Last  (or  the  First)  Homely  House.  Again  it  was 
line 7476=>evening,  their  ponies were  tired,  especially  the  one  that  carried  the  baggage;  and 
line 7477=>they all felt in need of rest. As they rode down the steep path, Bilbo heard the elves 
line 7478=>still  singing  in  the  trees,  as  if  they  had  not  stopped  since  he  left;  and  as  soon  as 
line 7479=>their riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a song of 
line 7480=>much the same kind as before. This is something like it: 
line 7481=> 
line 7482=>
line 7483=>The dragon is withered, 
line 7484=>His bones are now crumbled; 
line 7485=>His armour is shivered, 
line 7486=>His splendour is humbled! 
line 7487=>Though sword shall be rusted, 
line 7488=>And throne and crown perish  
line 7489=>With strength that men trusted 
line 7490=>And wealth that they cherish, 
line 7491=>Here grass is still growing, 
line 7492=>And leaves are yet swinging, 
line 7493=>The white water flowing, 
line 7494=>And elves are yet singing 
line 7495=>Come! Tra-la-la-lally! 
line 7496=>Come back to the valley! 
line 7497=> 
line 7498=>The stars are far brighter 
line 7499=>Than gems without measure, 
line 7500=>The moon is far whiter 
line 7501=>Than silver in treasure: 
line 7502=>The fire is more shining 
line 7503=>On hearth in the gloaming 
line 7504=>Than gold won by mining, 
line 7505=>So why go a -roaming? 
line 7506=>O! Tra-la-la-lally 
line 7507=>Come back to the Valley.  
line 7508=> 
line 7509=>O! Where are you going, 
line 7510=>
line 7511=>####-So late in returning? 
line 7512=>The river is flowing, 
line 7513=>The stars are all burning! 
line 7514=>O! Whither so laden, 
line 7515=>So sad and so dreary? 
line 7516=>Here elf and elf-maiden 
line 7517=>Now welcome the weary 
line 7518=>With Tra-la-la-lally 
line 7519=>Come back to the Va lley,  
line 7520=>Tra-la-la-lally 
line 7521=>Fa-la-la-lally 
line 7522=>Fa-la! 
line 7523=>
line 7524=> 
line 7525=>Then  the  elves  of  the  valley  came  out  and  greeted  them  and  led  them  across 
line 7526=>the  water  to  the  house  of  Elrond.  There  a  warm  welcome  was  made  them,  and 
line 7527=>there  were  many  eager  ears  that  evening  to  hear  the  tale  of  their  adventures. 
line 7528=>Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale 
line 7529=>he  knew,  for  he  had  been  in  it,  and  had  himself  told much  of  it  to  the  wizard  on 
line 7530=>their homeward way or  in  the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would 
line 7531=>open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet know came 
line 7532=>in. It was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he overheard 
line 7533=>the  words  of  the  wizard  to  Elrond.  It  appeared  that  Gandalf  had  been  to  a  great 
line 7534=>council of the white wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and that they had at 
line 7535=>last driven the Necromancer from his dark hold in the south of Mirkwood. 
line 7536=>"Ere  long  now,"  Gandalf  was  saying,  "The  Forest  will  grow  somewhat  more 
line 7537=>wholesome. The North will be freed from that horror for many long years, I hope. 
line 7538=>Yet I wish he were banished from the world!" 
line 7539=>"It would be well  indeed," said Elrond; "but I fear  that will not come about  in 
line 7540=>this age of the world, or for many after." 
line 7541=>When  the  tale  of  their  joumeyings  was  told,  there  were  other  tales,  and  yet 
line 7542=>more  tales,  tales of  long ago, and  tales  . of new  things, and  tales of no  time at all, 
line 7543=>till Bilbo's head fell forward on his chest, and he snored comfortably in a corner.  
line 7544=>He woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open 
line 7545=>window.  Below  it  many  elves  were  singing  loud  and  clear  on  the  banks  of  the 
line 7546=>stream. 
line 7547=> 
line 7548=>
line 7549=>Sing all ye joyful, now sing all together?  
line 7550=>The wind's in the free-top, the wind's in the heather;  
line 7551=>The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,  
line 7552=>
line 7553=>####-And bright are the windows of Night in her tower.  
line 7554=> 
line 7555=>Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together! 
line 7556=>Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather! 
line 7557=>The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting; 
line 7558=>Merry is May-time, and merry our meeting. 
line 7559=> 
line 7560=>Sing we now softly, and dreams let us weave him! 
line 7561=>Wind him in slumber and there let us leave him! 
line 7562=>The wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be his pillow! 
line 7563=>Lullaby! Lullaby! Alder and Willow! 
line 7564=> 
line 7565=>Sigh no more Pine, till the wind of the morn! 
line 7566=>Fall Moon! Dark be the land! 
line 7567=>Hush! Hush! Oak, Ash, and Thorn! 
line 7568=>Hushed be all water, till dawn is at hand! 
line 7569=>
line 7570=> 
line 7571=>"Well, Merry People!" said Bilbo looking out. "What time by the moon is this? 
line 7572=>Your lullaby would waken a drunken goblin! Yet I thank you." 
line 7573=>"And  your  snores  would  waken  a  stone  dragon  –  yet  we  thank  you,"  they 
line 7574=>answered  with  laughter.  "It  is  drawing    towards  dawn,  and  you  have  slept  now 
line 7575=>since the night's beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of weariness." 
line 7576=>"A  little  sleep  does  a  great  cure  in  the  house  of  Elrond,"  said  he;  "but  I  will 
line 7577=>take  all  the  cure  I  can  get.  A  second  good  night,  fair  friends!"  And  with  that  he 
line 7578=>went back to bed and slept till late morning. 
line 7579=>Weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and 
line 7580=>dance,  early  and  late,  with  the  elves  of  the  valley.  Yet  even  that  place  could  not 
line 7581=>long  delay  him  now,  and  he  thought  always  of  his  own  home.  After  a  week, 
line 7582=>therefore, he said farewell  to Elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he would 
line 7583=>accept, he  rode  away with Gandalf. Even  as  they  left  the valley  the  sky darkened 
line 7584=>in the West before them, and wind and rain came up to meet them. 
line 7585=>"Merry  is May-time!" said Bilbo, as  the  rain beat  into his  face. "But our back 
line 7586=>is to legends and we are coming home. I suppose this is a first taste of it." 
line 7587=>"There is a long road yet," said Gandalf. 
line 7588=>"But  it  is  the  last  road,"  said  Bilbo.  They  came  to  the  river  that  marked  the 
line 7589=>very  edge  of  the  borderland  of  the Wild,  and  to  the  ford  beneath  the  steep  bank, 
line 7590=>which  you  may  remember.  The  water  was  swollen  both  with  the  melting  of  the 
line 7591=>snows  at  the  approach  of  summer,  and  with  the  daylong  rain;  but  they  crossed 
line 7592=>with some difficulty, and pressed forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of their 
line 7593=>
line 7594=>####-journey.  This  was  much  as  it  had  been  before,  except  that  the  company  was 
line 7595=>smaller,  and  more  silent;  also  this  time  there were  no  trolls. At  each  point  on  the 
line 7596=>road Bilbo  recalled  the  happenings  and  the words  of  a  year  ago-it seemed  to him 
line 7597=>more  like  ten-so  that,  of  course,  he  quickly  noted  the  place  where  the  pony  had 
line 7598=>fallen  in  the  river,  and  they  had  turned  aside  for  their  nasty  adventure with  Tom 
line 7599=>and  Bert  and  Bill. Not  far  from  the  road  they  found  the  gold  of  the  trolls, which 
line 7600=>they had buried,  still hidden  and untouched.  "I have  enough  to  last me my  time," 
line 7601=>said Bilbo, when they had dug it up. "You had better take this, Gandalf. I daresay 
line 7602=>you can find a use for it." 
line 7603=>"Indeed I can!" said the wizard. "But share and share alike! You may find you 
line 7604=>have more needs than you expect." 
line 7605=>So they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who were not at all 
line 7606=>pleased  about  it.  After  that  their  going  was  slower,  for  most  of  the  time  they 
line 7607=>walked.  But  the  land  was  green  and  there  was  much  grass  through  which  the 
line 7608=>hobbit  strolled  along  contentedly.  He  mopped  his  face  with  a  red  silk 
line 7609=>handkerchief-no!  not  a  single  one  of  his own had  survived, he had borrowed  this 
line 7610=>one from Elrond  –for now June had brought summer, and  the weather was bright 
line 7611=>and hot again. 
line 7612=>As  all  things  come  to  an  end,  even  this  story,  a  day  came  at  last  when  they 
line 7613=>were in sight of the country where Bilbo had been born and bred, where the shapes 
line 7614=>of  the  land  and  of  the  trees  were  as  well  known  to  him  as  his  hands  and  toes. 
line 7615=>Coming  to  a  rise  he  could  see  his  own  Hill  in  the  distance,  and  he  stopped 
line 7616=>suddenly and said: 
line 7617=> 
line 7618=>
line 7619=>Roads go ever ever on, 
line 7620=>Over rock and under tree, 
line 7621=>By caves where never sun has shone, 
line 7622=>By streams that never find the sea; 
line 7623=> 
line 7624=>Over snow by winter sown, 
line 7625=>And through the merry flowers of June, 
line 7626=>Over grass and over stone, 
line 7627=>And under mountains in the moon. 
line 7628=> 
line 7629=>Roads go ever ever on 
line 7630=>Under cloud and under star,  
line 7631=>Yet feet that wandering have gone 
line 7632=>Turn at last to home afar.  
line 7633=> 
line 7634=>
line 7635=>####-Eyes that fire and sword have seen 
line 7636=>And horror in the halls of stone 
line 7637=>Look at last on meadows green 
line 7638=>And trees and hills they long have known. 
line 7639=>
line 7640=> 
line 7641=>Gandalf  looked  at  him.  "My  dear  Bilbo!"  he  said.  "Something  is  the  matter 
line 7642=>with you! You are not the hobbit that you were." 
line 7643=>And so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came right 
line 7644=>back  to  Bilbo's  own  door.  "Bless  me!  What's  going  on?"  he  cried.  There  was  a 
line 7645=>great  commotion,  and  people  of  all  sorts,  respectable  and  unrespectable,  were 
line 7646=>thick  round  the  door,  and many were  going  in  and  out-not even wiping  their  feet 
line 7647=>on the mat, as Bilbo noticed with annoyance. 
line 7648=>If he was surprised,  they were more surprised still. He had arrived back  in  the 
line 7649=>middle  of an auction! There was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate, 
line 7650=>stating  that  on  June  the  Twenty-second  Messrs.  Grubb,  Grubb,  and  Bun-owes 
line 7651=>would  sell  by  auction  the  effects  of  the  late  Bilbo  Baggins  Esquire,  of  Bag-End, 
line 7652=>Underhill,  Hobbiton.  Sale  to  commence  at  ten  o'clock  sharp.  It  was  now  nearly 
line 7653=>lunch-time,  and most  of  the  things  had  already  been  sold,  for  various  prices  from 
line 7654=>next  to  nothing  to  old  songs  (as  is  not  unusual  at  auctions).  Bilbo's  cousins  the 
line 7655=>Sackville-Bagginses  were,  in  fact,  busy  measuring  his  rooms  to  see  if  their  own 
line 7656=>furniture would  fit.  In  short Bilbo was  "Presumed Dead,"  and not  everybody  that 
line 7657=>said so was sorry to find the presumption wrong. 
line 7658=>The  return  of  Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins  created  quite  a  disturbance,  both  under  the 
line 7659=>Hill  and  over  the Hill, and across  the Water;  it was a great deal more  than a nine 
line 7660=>days' wonder.  The  legal  bother,  indeed,  lasted  for  years.  It was  quite  a  long  time 
line 7661=>before Mr. Baggins was in fact admitted to be alive again. The people who had got 
line 7662=>specially  good  bargains  at  the  Sale  took  a  deal  of  convincing;  and  in  the  end  to 
line 7663=>sav6  time  Bilbo  had  to  buy  back  quite  a  lot  of  his  own  furniture.  Many  of  his 
line 7664=>silver  spoons mysteriously  disappeared  and were  never  accounted  for.  Personally 
line 7665=>he  suspected  the  Sackville-Bagginses.  On  their  side  they  never  admitted  that  the 
line 7666=>returned  Baggins  was  genuine,  and  they  were  not  on  friendly  terms  with  Bilbo 
line 7667=>ever after. They really had wanted to live in his nice hobbit-hole so very much. 
line 7668=>Indeed Bilbo  found he had  lost more  than  spoons  – he had lost his reputation. 
line 7669=>It  is  true  that  for  ever  after  he  remained  an  elf-friend,  and  had  the  honour  of 
line 7670=>dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever passed that way; but he was no longer 
line 7671=>quite  respectable.  He  was  in  fact  held  by  all  the  hobbits  of  the  neighbourhood to 
line 7672=>be  'queer'-except by his nephews and nieces on  the Took  side, but even  they were 
line 7673=>not  encouraged  in  their  friendship  by  their  elders.  I  am  sorry  to  say  he  did  not 
line 7674=>
line 7675=>####-mind.  He  was  quite  content;  and  the  sound  of  the  kettle  on  his  hearth  was  ever 
line 7676=>after more musical  than  it had been  even  in  the quiet days before  the Unexpected 
line 7677=>Party. His sword he hung over  the mantelpiece. His coat of mail was arranged on 
line 7678=>a  stand  in  the hall  (until he  lent  it  to  a Museum). His gold  and  silver was  largely 
line 7679=>spent in presents, both useful and extravagant – which to a certain extent accounts 
line 7680=>for  the  affection  of  his  nephews  and  his  nieces.  His  magic  ring  he  kept  a  great 
line 7681=>secret,  for  he  chiefly  used  it  when  unpleasant  callers  came.  He  took  to  writing 
line 7682=>poetry  and  visiting  the  elves;  and  though  many  shook  their  heads  and  touched 
line 7683=>their  foreheads  and  said  "Poor  old Baggins!"  and  though  few  believed  any  of  his 
line 7684=>tales,  he  remained  very  happy  to  the  end  of  his  days,  and  those  were 
line 7685=>extraordinarily long. 
line 7686=>One  autumn  evening  some  years  afterwards  Bilbo  was  sitting  in  his  study 
line 7687=>writing  his  memoirs  –  he  thought  of  calling  them  "There  and  Back  Again,  a 
line 7688=>Hobbit's  Holiday"  –  when  there  was  a  ring  at  the  door.  It  was  Gandalf  and  a 
line 7689=>dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin. 
line 7690=>"Come  in!  Come  in!"  said  Bilbo,  and  soon  they  were  settled  in  chairs  by  the 
line 7691=>fire. If Balin noticed that Mr. Baggins' waistcoat was more extensive (and had real 
line 7692=>gold buttons), Bilbo also noticed that Balm's beard was several inches longer, and 
line 7693=>his jewelled belt was of great magnificence. 
line 7694=>They  fell  to  talking  of  their  times  together,  of  course,  and  Bilbo  asked  how 
line 7695=>things  were  going  in  the  lands  of  the Mountain.  It  seemed  they  were  going  very 
line 7696=>well.  Bard  had  rebuilt  the  town  in  Dale  and  men  had  gathered  to  him  from  the 
line 7697=>Lake  and  from  South  and  West,  and  all  the  valley  had  become  tilled  again  and 
line 7698=>rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit 
line 7699=>and  feasting  in  autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and was more prosperous 
line 7700=>than  ever,  and much wealth went  up  and down the Running River; and there was 
line 7701=>friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and men. 
line 7702=>The old Master had come to a bad end. Bard had given him much gold for the 
line 7703=>help  of  the  Lake-people,  but  being  of  the  kind  that  easily  catches  such  disease  he 
line 7704=>fell under the dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it, and died 
line 7705=>of starvation in the Waste, deserted by his companions. 
line 7706=>"The  new  Master  is  of  wiser  kind,"  said  Balin,  "and  very  popular,  for,  of 
line 7707=>course,  he  gets  most  of  the  credit  for  the  present  prosperity.  They  are  making 
line 7708=>songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold." 
line 7709=>"Then  the  prophecies  of  the  old  songs  have  turned  out  to  be  true,  after  a 
line 7710=>fashion!" said Bilbo. 
line 7711=>
line 7712=>####-"Of  course!"  said Gandalf.  "And why  should  not  they  prove  true? Surely you 
line 7713=>don't  disbelieve  the  prophecies,  because  you  had  a  hand  in  bringing  them  about 
line 7714=>yourself? You  don't  really  suppose,  do  you,  that  all  your  adventures  and  escapes 
line 7715=>were  managed  by  mere  luck,  just  for  your  sole  benefit?  You  are  a  very  fine 
line 7716=>person,  Mr.  Baggins,  and  I  am  very  fond  of  you;  but  you  are  only  quite  a  little 
line 7717=>fellow in a wide world after all!" 
line 7718=>"Thank goodness!" said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.

line 7818=>####-Foreword 
line 7819=>
line 7820=> 
line 7821=> 
line 7822=>     This  tale grew in the telling, until it became  a history of the Great 
line 7823=>War of the  Ring and included  many glimpses of the yet more ancient history 
line 7824=>that preceded it. It was begun soon after The  Hobbit was written and before 
line 7825=>its publication in 1937; but I did not go  on with this sequel, for I wished 
line 7826=>first  to complete and set in  order the mythology and  legends of the Elder  
line 7827=>Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do  this 
line 7828=>for my own satisfaction,  and  I had little hope that other people would  be 
line 7829=>interested  in  this work, especially  since it was primarily  linguistic in 
line 7830=>inspiration and  was begun  in order to provide  the necessary background of 
line 7831=>'history' for Elvish tongues. 
line 7832=>     When  those  whose advice and opinion I sought corrected little hope to 
line 7833=>no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by  requests from readers for  
line 7834=>more information concerning hobbits and their adventures. But the story  was 
line 7835=>drawn  irresistibly  towards the  older world, and became an account,  as it 
line 7836=>were, of its end and passing away  before its beginning and middle had  been 
line 7837=>told. The process  had begun  in the writing  of The Hobbit, in which  there 
line 7838=>were  already  some  references to the older  matter:  Elrond, Gondolin, the 
line 7839=>High-elves, and the  orcs,  as  well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of 
line 7840=>things higher or deeper  or darker than its surface: Durin,  Moria, Gandalf, 
line 7841=>the Necromancer,  the  Ring.  The  discovery  of the significance  of  these 
line 7842=>glimpses and of  their relation to  the ancient histories revealed the Third 
line 7843=>Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring. 
line 7844=>     Those who  had asked for  more information about hobbits eventually got  
line 7845=>it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition of The Lord of the 
line 7846=>Rings went on at intervals during the  years 1936 to 1949, a period in which  
line 7847=>I had  many  duties that  I did not neglect, and  many  other interests as a  
line 7848=>learner and teacher  that often absorbed  me. The delay was, of course, also 
line 7849=>increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which  year the tale 
line 7850=>had not yet reached  the  end  of Book  One. In spite of the darkness of the 
line 7851=>next  five years I  found that the story could  not now be  wholly abandoned,  
line 7852=>and  I plodded on, mostly  by night, till I stood  by Balin's tomb in Moria. 
line 7853=>There I halted for a long while. It  was almost a  year later when I went on 
line 7854=>and so came to Lothlurien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year  
line 7855=>
line 7856=>####-I  wrote the first drafts of the  matter  that now stands as Book Three, and 
line 7857=>the beginnings of  chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons 
line 7858=>flared in  Anurien  and Thjoden came to Harrowdale I stopped.  Foresight had 
line 7859=>failed and there was no time for thought. 
line 7860=>     It was  during 1944  that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a  
line 7861=>war which it was my task to  conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself 
line 7862=>to tackle the journey of Frodo  to  Mordor.  These chapters,  eventually  to 
line 7863=>become  Book Four,  were  written  and  sent  out  as  a  serial  to my son, 
line 7864=>Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF.  Nonetheless it took another 
line 7865=>five  years before the tale was brought to its present end;  in that  time I 
line 7866=>changed my house, my chair,  and my college,  and the days though  less dark 
line 7867=>were no less laborious.  Then when the 'end' had  at last  been reached  the 
line 7868=>whole story had to be revised, and indeed  largely re-written backwards. And 
line 7869=>it had to be typed, and  re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by 
line 7870=>the ten-fingered was beyond my means. 
line 7871=>     The Lord of the  Rings has been read by many  people since  it  finally 
line 7872=>appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to 
line 7873=>the many opinions  or guesses that I  have  received or have read concerning 
line 7874=>the motives  and meaning  of  the tale. The prime motive was the desire of a  
line 7875=>tale-teller  to try  his hand at a  really long  story that would  hold  the 
line 7876=>attention  of  readers, amuse them, delight  them, and at times maybe excite 
line 7877=>them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own  feelings for what is 
line 7878=>appealing or moving, and for  many the guide  was inevitably often at fault. 
line 7879=>Some who have read the book, or at  any rate have reviewed it, have found it 
line 7880=>boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no  cause  to complain, since  I 
line 7881=>have similar opinions of  their works, or of the kinds  of writing that they 
line 7882=>evidently  prefer. But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed 
line 7883=>my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a  
line 7884=>long tale to please everybody at  all  points, nor to displease everybody at 
line 7885=>the same points; for I find from the letters that I have  received  that the 
line 7886=>passages or chapters that are to some a blemish  are all by others specially 
line 7887=>approved. The  most critical  reader of all, myself, now finds many defects,  
line 7888=>minor and major, but  being fortunately under no obligation either to review 
line 7889=>the book  or  to write  it again, he will pass over these in  silence, except 
line 7890=>one that has been noted by others: the book is too short. 
line 7891=>     As for any inner meaning or  'message', it has in the intention  of the 
line 7892=>author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical. As the story grew it put 
line 7893=>
line 7894=>####-down roots  (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but  its main 
line 7895=>theme was  settled from  the outset by the  inevitable choice of the Ring as 
line 7896=>the link between it and  The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, "The Shadow of the 
line 7897=>Past', is  one of the oldest parts of the tale.  It  was written long before 
line 7898=>the foreshadow  of  1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and 
line 7899=>from that  point the  story would have developed along essentially  the same 
line 7900=>lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before 
line 7901=>in mind, or in some  cases already written, and  little or nothing in it was 
line 7902=>modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels.  
line 7903=>     The real war  does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its 
line 7904=>conclusion. If it had inspired  or  directed  the development of the legend, 
line 7905=>then certainly the  Ring would have  been seized and used against Sauron; he 
line 7906=>would  not have been annihilated  but enslaved, and Barad-dyr would not have 
line 7907=>been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, 
line 7908=>would m the confusion  and treacheries of the  time have found in Mordor the 
line 7909=>missing links in his own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would 
line 7910=>have made a Great  Ring  of his  own with which to challenge the self-styled 
line 7911=>Ruler of Middle-earth.  In that conflict both sides would  have held hobbits 
line 7912=>in hatred and contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves. 
line 7913=>     Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of 
line 7914=>those  who  like allegory  or  topical reference.  But I  cordially  dislike 
line 7915=>allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old 
line 7916=>and  wary  enough to  detect  its  presence. I  much prefer history, true or  
line 7917=>feigned, with its varied  applicability  to the  thought  and  experience of 
line 7918=>readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but  the 
line 7919=>one  resides  in the  freedom of the reader, and the  other in  the purposed 
line 7920=>domination of the author. 
line 7921=>     An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected  by his experience,  
line 7922=>but the ways in which a story-germ uses the soil of experience are extremely  
line 7923=>complex,  and  attempts  to  define  the  process  are at  best guesses from 
line 7924=>evidence  that  is  inadequate  and  ambiguous.  It  is also  false,  though 
line 7925=>naturally  attractive,  when  the  lives  of   an  author  and  critic  have 
line 7926=>overlapped, to  suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times 
line 7927=>common to both were necessarily the most powerful influences. One has 
line 7928=>indeed 
line 7929=>personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but 
line 7930=>as the years go by it seems now often forgotten that to  be caught  in youth 
line 7931=>
line 7932=>####-by  1914 was no less hideous an experience  than to  be involved in 1939 and 
line 7933=>the  following years. By 1918 all but one of my close  friends were dead. Or  
line 7934=>to  take  a less grievous  matter:  it  has been supposed by some  that 'The 
line 7935=>Scouring of  the Shire' reflects the situation in England at the time when I 
line 7936=>was finishing  my tale. It does  not. It is an  essential  part of the plot, 
line 7937=>foreseen from the outset, though in the event  modified  by the character of 
line 7938=>Saruman as  developed  in  the story  without, need I  say,  any allegorical 
line 7939=>significance or contemporary political reference  whatsoever. It has  indeed 
line 7940=>some basis in experience,  though  slender (for the  economic situation  was 
line 7941=>entirely different),  and much further back. The country in which I lived in 
line 7942=>childhood was  being  shabbily  destroyed before  I was  ten, in  days  when 
line 7943=>motor -cars were  rare objects  (I had  never seen  one) and  men wer e  still 
line 7944=>building suburban railways.  Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last  
line 7945=>decrepitude of  the once  thriving  corn-mill beside its  pool that long ago 
line 7946=>seemed to me so important.  I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but 
line 7947=>his father,  the Old  miller,  had  a  black  beard,  and he  was  not named 
line 7948=>Sandyman. 
line 7949=>     The  Lord  of  the  Rings is  now  issued in  a  new  edition,  and the 
line 7950=>opportunity  has  been  taken  of  revising  it.  A  number  of  errors  and 
line 7951=>inconsistencies that still rema ined in  the text have been corrected, and an 
line 7952=>attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which attentive 
line 7953=>readers have raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries, and 
line 7954=>if some seem to have been passed over  that  may be because I have failed to  
line 7955=>keep  my  notes in  order;  but many  enquiries  could only  be answered  by  
line 7956=>additional appendices, or indeed  by the  production  of an accessory volume  
line 7957=>containing  much of  the material that I did not  include  in  the  original 
line 7958=>edition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In the meantime 
line 7959=>this edition offers this Foreword, an  addition to the Prologue, some notes,  
line 7960=>and an index of the names of persons and places. This index is in  intention 
line 7961=>complete in items  but not in references,  since for the present  purpose it 
line 7962=>has been  necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full use of 
line 7963=>the  material  prepared  for  me  by Mrs.  N. Smith,  belongs  rather to the 
line 7964=>accessory volume.

line 7971=>
line 7972=>1. Concerning Hobbits 
line 7973=>
line 7974=> 
line 7975=> 
line 7976=>     This  book  is largely  concerned  with  Hobbits, and from its pages  a  
line 7977=>reader  may discover  much of their character and a little of their history. 
line 7978=>Further information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of 
line 7979=>Westmarch  that has already been published, under the  title of The  Hobbit. 
line 7980=>That story  was derived  from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed 
line 7981=>by  Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become famous in  the world at large, 
line 7982=>and called by him There and  Back Again, since they told of his journey into 
line 7983=>the East and his  return: an adventure  which later involved all the Hobbits 
line 7984=>in the great events of that Age that are here related. 
line 7985=>     Many, however, may wish to know more about  this remarkable people 
line 7986=>from 
line 7987=>the outset, whi le some  may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a  
line 7988=>few notes on the more important points are here  collected from Hobbit-lore,  
line 7989=>and the first adventure is briefly recalled. 
line 7990=>     Hobbits are  an  unobtrusive  but  very  ancient  people, more numerous 
line 7991=>formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and  good tilled 
line 7992=>earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. 
line 7993=>They do not and did not understand or like machines more  complicated than a  
line 7994=>forge-bellows, a water -mill, or a  hand-loom, though  they were skilful with  
line 7995=>tools. Even in ancient days they  were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as 
line 7996=>they call us, and now  they avoid us with  dismay and are  becoming hard  to  
line 7997=>find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined  
line 7998=>to be  fat  and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless  nimble and 
line 7999=>deft  in  their  movements.  They  possessed  from  the  first  the  art  of 
line 8000=>disappearing  swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to 
line 8001=>meet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to Men it may 
line 8002=>seem  magical. But Hobbits have never, in  fact,  studied magic of any kind,  
line 8003=>and their elusiveness  is due  solely to a professional skill  that heredity 
line 8004=>and  practice,  and  a  close  friendship  with  the  earth,  have  rendered 
line 8005=>
line 8006=>####-inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.  
line 8007=>     For  they are  a  little people,  smaller  than Dwarves:  less tout and 
line 8008=>stocky, that is, even when they  are not actually much shorter. Their height 
line 8009=>is  variable, ranging between two and  four feet of our measure. They seldom 
line 8010=>now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they  say, and in ancient days 
line 8011=>they were  taller. According to the Red Book,  Bandobras Took  (Bullroarer), 
line 8012=>son of Isengrim the Second,  was four foot five and able to ride a  horse. He 
line 8013=>was  surpassed  in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of  old;  
line 8014=>but that curious matter is dealt with in this book. 
line 8015=>     As for the Hobbits of the  Shire,  with whom these tales are concerned, 
line 8016=>in  the  days  of their peace and prosperity they  were  a  merry folk. They 
line 8017=>dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green;  but they 
line 8018=>seldom wore shoes, since  their feet had tough leathery soles  and were clad 
line 8019=>in  a  thick  curling hair, much like  the hair  of  their  heads, which was 
line 8020=>commonly  brown.  Thus,  the  only  craft  little  practised among them  was 
line 8021=>shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other 
line 8022=>useful and comely  things.  Their faces  were as  a rule good-natured rather  
line 8023=>than  beautiful,  broad,  bright-eyed,  red-cheeked,  with  mouths   apt  to 
line 8024=>laughter,  and to eating and  drinking. And laugh  they  did,  and  eat, and 
line 8025=>drink, often and heartily, being fond  of simple  jests at all times, and of 
line 8026=>six meals  a  day (when  they  could  get them).  They  were  hospitable and 
line 8027=>delighted in  parties, and  in  presents, which  they  gave away freely  and 
line 8028=>eagerly accepted. 
line 8029=>     It  is plain indeed that  in spite  of later  estrangement Hobbits  are 
line 8030=>relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old 
line 8031=>they spoke  the languages  of Men,  after their own fashion,  and liked  and 
line 8032=>disliked much  the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship 
line 8033=>is  can no longer be discovered. The  beginning of Hobbits lies  far back in 
line 8034=>the  Elder Days that  are  now  lost and  forgotten.  Only  the Elves  still 
line 8035=>preserve any  records  of  that  vanished  time, and  their  traditions  are 
line 8036=>concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom 
line 8037=>and Hobbits are not mentioned at  all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits  had, in 
line 8038=>fact, lived quietly in  Middle-earth for  many  long years before other folk  
line 8039=>became  even aware of  them.  And the world being after all  full of strange 
line 8040=>creatures   beyond  count,  these  little  people   seemed  of  very  little 
line 8041=>importance. But in the days of Bilbo, and  of Frodo his  heir, they suddenly 
line 8042=>became, by no wish of  their  own, both important and renowned, and troubled 
line 8043=>
line 8044=>####-the counsels of the Wise and  the Great. 
line 8045=>     Those days,  the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and  the 
line 8046=>shape  of all lands has  been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then  
line 8047=>lived were doubtless  the  same  as  those  in which  they still linger: the 
line 8048=>North-West  of the  Old World, east of  the Sea. Of their original home  the 
line 8049=>Hobbits in Bilbo's time preserved no  knowledge. A  love  of learning (other  
line 8050=>than genealogical lore) was far from general among them,  but there remained 
line 8051=>still a few  in  the  older families  who  studied their own books, and even 
line 8052=>gathered reports  of old times and distant lands  from Elves,  Dwarves,  and 
line 8053=>Men. Their own  records  began only  after the settlement of the  Shire, and 
line 8054=>their most ancient  legends hardly looked further  back than their Wandering  
line 8055=>Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of 
line 8056=>their peculiar words  and customs, that like many other  folk Hobbits had in 
line 8057=>the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time 
line 8058=>when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of 
line 8059=>Greenwood 
line 8060=>the Great  and the Misty Mountains. Why they  later undertook  the hard  and 
line 8061=>perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer  certain. Their 
line 8062=>own  accounts speak  of the multiplying of Men in  the land, and of a shadow 
line 8063=>that fell on the forest,  so that it became  darkened  and its new  name was 
line 8064=>Mirkwood. 
line 8065=>     Before the  crossing  of the  mountains the Hobbits had  already become 
line 8066=>divided  into  three  somewhat   different  breeds:  Harfoots,  Stoors,  and 
line 8067=>Fallohides. The Harfoots were  browner  of skin, smaller,  and  shorter, and 
line 8068=>they were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble;  
line 8069=>and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier  
line 8070=>in build; their feet  and hands were larger,  and they preferred flat  lands 
line 8071=>and riversides.  The Fallohides  were fairer of  skin and also of  hair, and 
line 8072=>they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of  trees and 
line 8073=>of woodlands.  
line 8074=>     The  Harfoots had  much  to do  with Dwarves in ancient times, and long 
line 8075=>lived in the  foothills  of  the  mountains. They moved westward early,  and 
line 8076=>roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the  others were still in the 
line 8077=>Wilderland. They were the most normal  and representative variety of Hobbit, 
line 8078=>and  far  the most  numerous. They  were the most inclined to settle  in one 
line 8079=>place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in  tunnels and 
line 8080=>holes. 
line 8081=>
line 8082=>####-     The Stoors lingered long by  the  banks of  the Great River Anduin, and 
line 8083=>were less shy of Men.  They came west after  the  Harfoots and  followed the 
line 8084=>course of the  Loudwater  southwards;  and  there  many of  them  long dwelt 
line 8085=>between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again. 
line 8086=>     The  Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were 
line 8087=>more friendly with Elves  than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in 
line 8088=>language  and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to 
line 8089=>tilling.  They  crossed the mountains north of Rivendell  and came  down the  
line 8090=>River Hoarwell. In  Eriador they soon  mingled with the other kinds that had 
line 8091=>preceded them,  but being somewhat  bolder  and more adventurous, they  were 
line 8092=>often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even 
line 8093=>in Bilbo's time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the 
line 8094=>greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland. 
line 8095=>     In the  westlands  of Eriador, between  the  Misty  Mountains  and  the 
line 8096=>Mountains of  Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a  remnant 
line 8097=>still dwelt there of the D®nedain, the kings of Men that  came over the  Sea  
line 8098=>out of  Westernesse; but  they were  dwindling fast and  the  lands of their 
line 8099=>North Kingdom were falling far and  wide into waste. There was  room and  to 
line 8100=>spare for  incomers, and ere long  the Hobbits began  to  settle in  ordered 
line 8101=>communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been 
line 8102=>forgotten in Bilbo's time;  but  one of the  first to become important still 
line 8103=>endured, though reduced in  size; this  was at Bree and in the Chetwood that 
line 8104=>lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire. 
line 8105=>     It was in these  early days,  doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their 
line 8106=>letters and  began to write  after  the  manner  of the D®nedain, who had in 
line 8107=>their  turn long before learned  the art from  the Elves. And in  those days 
line 8108=>also they  forgot  whatever languages  they had used before,  and spoke ever  
line 8109=>after the  Common  Speech, the  Westron as it  was  named, that was  current 
line 8110=>through all the lands of the kings  from Arnor to  Gondor, and about all the 
line 8111=>coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune. Yet they kept  a few words of their 
line 8112=>own,  as  well as their own names of months  and days, and  a great store of 
line 8113=>personal names out of the past. 
line 8114=>     About this time legend among  the Hobbits first  becomes history with a  
line 8115=>reckoning  of years. For it was in the  one thousand  six hundred  and first  
line 8116=>year of the  Third Age  that the  Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set 
line 8117=>out  from  Bree; and having  obtained  permission  from  the  high  king  at 
line 8118=>Fornost1,  they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a  great following of 
line 8119=>
line 8120=>####-Hobbits.  They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been  built  in 
line 8121=>the  days  of the  power of the North Kingdom,  and they took ail  the  land 
line 8122=>beyond  to  dwell in,  between  the river and  the Far Downs.  All  that was 
line 8123=>demanded of them was  that they should keep the Great Bridge in  repair, and 
line 8124=>all other bridges  and roads,  speed the king's messengers, and  acknowledge 
line 8125=>his lordship. 
line 8126=>     Thus began  the Shire-reckoning, for the year  of  the  crossing of the 
line 8127=>Brandywine (as the  Hobbits turned the name) became  Year One  of the Shire, 
line 8128=>and all later dates were reckoned from it.2 At once the western Hobbits fell 
line 8129=>in love with their new land, and they  remained there, and soon passed  once 
line 8130=>more out  of the history  of Men and of Elves. While there  was still a king 
line 8131=>they  were in name his subjects, but they were, in  fact, ruled by their own 
line 8132=>chieftains  and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To  the 
line 8133=>last  battle at Fornost with the Witch -lord of Angmar they  sent some bowmen 
line 8134=>to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record 
line 8135=>it.  But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the  Hobbits took the 
line 8136=>land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the 
line 8137=>authority of the king that  was  gone. There for a thousand years  they were 
line 8138=>little troubled  by wars, and  they prospered and  multiplied after the Dark 
line 8139=>Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of  the Long Winter and the famine  that 
line 8140=>followed it. Many thousands then  perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60) 
line 8141=>were at the time of this  tale long past and  the Hobbits  had again  become 
line 8142=>accustomed  to plenty. The land  was rich and kindly, and though it had long 
line 8143=>been deserted  when they entered it,  it  had  before been  well tilled, and 
line 8144=>there the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.  
line 8145=>     Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, 
line 8146=>and fifty from the northern moors to  the marshes in the south. The  Hobbits 
line 8147=>named  it  the Shire, as the region of the  authority of their Thain,  and a  
line 8148=>district of well-ordered  business; and there  in that pleasant  comer of the 
line 8149=>world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less 
line 8150=>and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think 
line 8151=>that  peace and  plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the  right of  all 
line 8152=>sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the 
line 8153=>Guardians, and of  the labours of those that made possible the long peace of 
line 8154=>the  Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased  to  remember  
line 8155=>it. 
line 8156=>     At no  time had Hobbits of any  kind been  warlike, and  they had never  
line 8157=>
line 8158=>####-fought  among  themselves. In olden days  they had, of  course,  been  often 
line 8159=>obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo's time 
line 8160=>that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and 
line 8161=>indeed the  only  one  that had ever been  fought  within the borders of the 
line 8162=>Shire, was beyond  living memory: the Battle  of  Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in  
line 8163=>which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Orcs. Even the weathers had 
line 8164=>grown 
line 8165=>milder, and the  wolves  that had once  come ravening  out of the  North  in 
line 8166=>bitter white winters were  now only  a grandfather's tale. So,  though there 
line 8167=>was still  some store of  weapons in the  Shire, these were  used  mostly as 
line 8168=>trophies, hanging above hearths or on  walls, or gathered into the museum at 
line 8169=>Michel Delving. The  Mathom-house it was  called; for  anything that Hobbits 
line 8170=>had  no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away,  they  called a  
line 8171=>mathom.  Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, 
line 8172=>and 
line 8173=>many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son. 
line 8174=>     Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. 
line 8175=>They were,  if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they  were, 
line 8176=>perhaps,  so unwearyingly fond of  good things not least because they could, 
line 8177=>when put to it, do without them,  and could survive rough handling by grief,  
line 8178=>foe,  or weather in  a way that astonished those who did not know them  well 
line 8179=>and  looked  no further than their bellies and their well-fed  faces. Though 
line 8180=>slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty 
line 8181=>at bay,  and  at  need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow,  
line 8182=>for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows.  
line 8183=>If any Hobbit stooped for a stone,  it was well to get  quickly under cover, 
line 8184=>as all trespassing beasts knew very well. 
line 8185=>     All Hobbits had originally  lived in  holes in the  ground, or  so they 
line 8186=>believed,  and in such dwellings they still  felt most at  home; but  in  the 
line 8187=>course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually 
line 8188=>in  the Shire in Bilbo's  days it  was, as a rule, only the richest and  the 
line 8189=>poorest Hobbits  that maintained the old custom. The poorest  went on  living 
line 8190=>in burrows  of the  most  primitive  kind,  mere holes indeed, with only one 
line 8191=>window or  none;  while  the  well-to-do  still constructed  more  luxurious 
line 8192=>versions of the simple diggings of old.  But suitable  sites for these large 
line 8193=>and ramifying tunnels (or smials as they called them) were not everywhere to 
line 8194=>be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as  they 
line 8195=>
line 8196=>####-multiplied, began to  build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly  regions 
line 8197=>and the older villages, such  as  Hobbiton or Tuckborough,  or in the  chief 
line 8198=>township of the Shire, Michel Delving  on  the White Downs, there  were  now 
line 8199=>many houses  of wood,  brick, or stone. These  were  specially  favoured  by 
line 8200=>millers, smiths, ropers,  and cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even 
line 8201=>when  they  had holes to live in. Hobbits had long been  accustomed to build 
line 8202=>sheds and workshops. 
line 8203=>     The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among 
line 8204=>the inhabitants of the Marish  down by the Brandywine.  The  Hobbits of that 
line 8205=>quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore 
line 8206=>dwarf-boots in muddy  weather. But they were well known  to  be Stoors in  a 
line 8207=>large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on 
line 8208=>their chins. No Har foot  or Fallohide had  any trace of a beard. Indeed, the 
line 8209=>folk  of  the Marish,  and  of Buckland,  east  of  the  River,  which  they 
line 8210=>afterwards  occupied, came for the most  part  later into the Shire  up from 
line 8211=>south-away;  and  they still had many peculiar names and strange  words  not 
line 8212=>found elsewhere in the Shire. 
line 8213=>     It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, 
line 8214=>was derived from the D®nedain. But  the Hobbits  may  have learned it direct 
line 8215=>from the Elves, the teachers of  Men  in their  youth. For the Elves of  the 
line 8216=>High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that 
line 8217=>time at  the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other  places within reach 
line 8218=>of the  Shire. Three  Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen  on 
line 8219=>the  Tower Hills  beyond the  western marches.  They shone far  off  in  the 
line 8220=>moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. 
line 8221=>The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop  
line 8222=>of that tower; but  no  Hobbit had ever  been known to climb it. Indeed, few 
line 8223=>Hobbits  had ever  seen or  sailed  upon the Sea, and fewer  still had  ever  
line 8224=>returned to  report  it. Most Hobbits regarded even  rivers  and small boats 
line 8225=>with deep misgivings, and not  many of  them could swim.  And as the days of 
line 8226=>the Shire lengthened  they  spoke  less and  less with  the  Elves, and grew 
line 8227=>afraid  of them, and distrustful of those  that  had dealings with them; and 
line 8228=>the Sea  became  a word  of fear  among them, and a token of death, and they 
line 8229=>turned their faces away from the hills in the west. 
line 8230=>     The craft  of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits 
line 8231=>used it in  their own fashion. They did not go in  for  towers. Their houses 
line 8232=>were usually long, low,  and comfortable. The oldest kind  were,  indeed, no 
line 8233=>
line 8234=>####-more than built imitations of smials, thatched with dry  grass or  straw, or  
line 8235=>roofed with turves,  and having walls somewhat  bulged. That stage, however, 
line 8236=>belonged to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit-building had long  since 
line 8237=>been  altered, improved by devices,  learned from Dwarves,  or discovered by 
line 8238=>themselves.  A  preference for round windows, and even round  doors, was the 
line 8239=>chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit -architecture. 
line 8240=>     The houses  and  the  holes   of  Shire-hobbits  were  often  large, and 
line 8241=>inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very 
line 8242=>exceptional,  as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship 
line 8243=>with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case  of the Tooks of Great Smials, or  
line 8244=>the Brandybucks  of  Brandy Hall,  many  generations of  relatives  lived in 
line 8245=>(comparative) peace  together  in one ancestral  and many -tunnelled mansion. 
line 8246=>All Hobbits were, in any case,  clannish and reckoned up their relationships 
line 8247=>with great care. They drew long and elaborate family -trees with  innumerable 
line 8248=>branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related 
line 8249=>to whom,  and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out 
line 8250=>a  family-tree  that included  even the more  important members of the  more 
line 8251=>important families at  the  time which these tales tell of. The genealogical 
line 8252=>trees  at  the  end  of  the  Red Book of  Westmarch  are  a  small book  in 
line 8253=>themselves,  and all but Hobbits  would find them  exceedingly dull. Hobbits 
line 8254=>delighted in such things, if they  were accurate: they liked  to  have books 
line 8255=>filled with  things that they already knew, set out fair and  square with no 
line 8256=>contradictions.

line 8260=>2. Concerning Pipe-weed 
line 8261=>
line 8262=> 
line 8263=> 
line 8264=>     There is another astonishing  thing about Hobbits of old  that must  be 
line 8265=>mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed  or inhaled, through pipes  of 
line 8266=>clay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of  a herb, which they  called  
line 8267=>pipe-weed or leaf, a variety  probably of Nicotiana. A great deal of mystery 
line 8268=>surrounds the  origin  of this peculiar  custom,  or  'art' as  the  Hobbits 
line 8269=>preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about it in antiquity was 
line 8270=>put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since he 
line 8271=>and  the   tobacco  of the Southfarthing  play  a part in  the  history  that 
line 8272=>follows, his remarks in the introduction to his Herblore of the Shire may be 
line 8273=>quoted. 
line 8274=>     'This,'  he says, 'is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our 
line 8275=>own invention.  When  Hobbi ts  first began  to smoke  is not known,  all the  
line 8276=>legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire 
line 8277=>smoked various herbs, some fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that 
line 8278=>Tobold Hornblower  of  Longbottom  in the Southfarthing first grew  the true 
line 8279=>pipe-weed in his gardens in  the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year  
line 8280=>1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from that district, 
line 8281=>especially the  varieties  now  known  as Longbottom  Leaf,  Old  Toby,  and 
line 8282=>Southern Star. 
line 8283=>     'How Old  Toby came by  the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day 
line 8284=>he would not tell.  He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is 
line 8285=>said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went 
line 8286=>further fr om the Shire than that.  It is thus quite possible that he learned 
line 8287=>of this plant in Bree, where now, at  any rate,  it grows well on  the south 
line 8288=>slopes of the hill. The  Bree-hobbits  claim to have been the  first  actual 
line 8289=>smokers of the pipe-weed.  They cla im,  of  course, to have done  everything  
line 8290=>before the people of the Shire,  whom they refer  to as "colonists"; but  in 
line 8291=>this case their claim is, I think,  likely to be true. And  certainly it was 
line 8292=>from Bree  that the  art  of smoking  the genuine weed sprea d  in the recent 
line 8293=>centuries among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers,  
line 8294=>as still passed  to and fro through that  ancient road-meeting. The home and 
line 8295=>centre of  the an is thus to be found in  the old inn of  Bree, The Prancing 
line 8296=>
line 8297=>####-Pony, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record. 
line 8298=>     'All the same,  observations  that I have made on my own many  journeys 
line 8299=>south have convinced me that the weed itself  is not  native to our parts of 
line 8300=>the  world,  but  came  northward  from the lower Anduin, whither  it was, I 
line 8301=>suspect, originally brought  over  Sea by the Men  of  Westernesse. It grows 
line 8302=>abundantly  in  Gondor, and  there  is richer and  larger than in the North, 
line 8303=>where it is never found wild, and flourishes  only in  warm sheltered places 
line 8304=>like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it sweet galenas, and esteem it only 
line 8305=>for the fragrance of its  flowers. From  that land it must have been carried 
line 8306=>up the Greenway  during the long centuries between the coming of Elendil and 
line 8307=>our own day.  But even the D®nedain of  Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits 
line 8308=>first put it into pipes.  Not even the Wizards first thought of that  before 
line 8309=>we did.  Though one Wizard that I knew took up the art long ago,  and became 
line 8310=>as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.'

line 8313=>
line 8314=>3. Of the Ordering of the Shire 
line 8315=>
line 8316=> 
line 8317=> 
line 8318=>     The  Shire was  divided  into  four  quarters,  the  Farthings  already 
line 8319=>referred to.  North,  South, East,  and  West;  and  these again each into a  
line 8320=>number of folklands,  which still bore the names of some of  the old leading  
line 8321=>families, although by the time  of this  history these names were no  longer 
line 8322=>found only in their  proper folklands.  Nearly all Tooks  still lived in the 
line 8323=>Tookland,  but that  was not  true  of  many  other  families,  such  as the 
line 8324=>Bagginses  or  the Boffins.  Outside the  Farthings  were the  East and West 
line 8325=>Marches:  the  Buckland  (see  beginning of Chapter  V,  Book  I);  and  the 
line 8326=>Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1462. 
line 8327=>     The Shire at  this time had hardly any 'government'. Families  for  the 
line 8328=>most part  managed their  own affairs. Growing  food and eating  it occupied  
line 8329=>most of their time. In  other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not 
line 8330=>greedy, but  contented and moderate, so  that estates, farms, workshops, and 
line 8331=>small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations.  
line 8332=>     There  remained,  of course, the  ancient tradition concerning the high 
line 8333=>king at  Fornost, or Norbury as they called it, away north of the Shire. But 
line 8334=>there had been no king for nearly  a thousand years,  and even the ruins  of 
line 8335=>Kings' Norbury  were covered with grass. Yet the Hobbits  still said of wild 
line 8336=>folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the king. 
line 8337=>For they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually 
line 8338=>they kept the laws of free will, because they were The Rules (as they said), 
line 8339=>both ancient and just. 
line 8340=>     It is true  that  the Took  family had long  been  pre-eminent; for the 
line 8341=>office  of  Thain had  passed  to them  (from the Oldbucks)  some  centuries 
line 8342=>before,  and the chief  Took had borne that title ever since. The  Thain was 
line 8343=>the  master  of  the  Shire-moot, and captain of  the Shire-muster  and  the 
line 8344=>Hobbitry-in-arms,  but  as  muster  and moot  were only  held  in  times  of 
line 8345=>emergency,  which no  longer occurred, the Thainship  had  ceased to be more 
line 8346=>than  a  nominal dignity. The  Took  family was  still,  indeed,  accorded a  
line 8347=>special respect, for it remained  both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and 
line 8348=>was  liable  to produce in ever y generation strong  characters  of  peculiar 
line 8349=>habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however, were 
line 8350=>
line 8351=>####-now  rather  tolerated (in  the  rich) than  generally  approved. The custom 
line 8352=>endured, nonetheless, of referring to the head of the  family  as The  Took, 
line 8353=>and of  adding  to  his  name, if  required, a number: such  as Isengrim the 
line 8354=>Second, for instance. 
line 8355=>     The only  real official  in the Shire  at  this date  was the Mayor  of 
line 8356=>Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was  elected every  seven years at the 
line 8357=>Free Fair on the White  Downs at  the Lithe, that is at Midsummer.  As mayor  
line 8358=>almost   his  only  duty   was  to  preside   at  banquets,  given   on  the 
line 8359=>Shire-holidays,  which occurred at  frequent intervals. But  the  offices of 
line 8360=>Postmaster and First Shirriff were attached  to  the  mayoralty, so that  he 
line 8361=>managed  both the  Messenger Service  and  the  Watch.  These were the  only 
line 8362=>Shire-services,  and the Messengers  were the  most  numerous,  and much the 
line 8363=>busier of the two. By no means a ll Hobbits were lettered, but those who were 
line 8364=>wrote constantly to all their friends (and a  selection  of their relations)  
line 8365=>who lived further off than an afternoon's walk. 
line 8366=>     The Shirriffs was the name  that the  Hobbits gave to  their police, or  
line 8367=>the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms 
line 8368=>(such things being  quite unknown), only  a feather in their caps;  and they 
line 8369=>were  in  practice rather haywards than policemen,  more concerned  with the 
line 8370=>strayings of  beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only twelve 
line 8371=>of them, three in  each  Farthing,  for  Inside Work. A  rather larger body, 
line 8372=>varying  at need,  was  employed  to  'beat  the  bounds', and to  see  that 
line 8373=>Outsiders of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance. 
line 8374=>     At the time  when this story begins the Bounders, as they were  called, 
line 8375=>had been greatly  increased.  There  were  many reports  and  complaints  of 
line 8376=>strange persons  and creatures prowling about the borders, or over them: the 
line 8377=>first  sign  that all  was not  quite as  it  should be, and always had been 
line 8378=>except  in tales and legends of  long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even  
line 8379=>Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty years  had passed since 
line 8380=>he set out on his  memorable journey, and he was old  even for Hobbits,  who 
line 8381=>reached a hundred  as often as not; but much evidently still remained of the 
line 8382=>considerable  wealth that he  had brought back. How  much or  how  little he 
line 8383=>revealed to no one,  not even to Frodo  his favourite 'nephew'. And he still 
line 8384=>kept secret the ring that he bad found. 
line 8385=>
line 8386=>####- 
line 8387=>
line 8388=>4. Of the Finding of the Ring  
line 8389=>
line 8390=> 
line 8391=> 
line 8392=>     As is  told in The Hobbit, there came one day to Bilbo's door the great 
line 8393=>Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed, 
line 8394=>than Thorin Oakenshield,  descendant  of kings, and his twelve companions in 
line 8395=>exile. With  them he set  out, to his own lasting astonishment, on a morning 
line 8396=>of  April, it being then  the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great 
line 8397=>treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the Kings under the Mountain,  beneath  Erebor 
line 8398=>in Dale, far off in the East. The quest was  successful, and the Dragon that 
line 8399=>guarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before  all  was won the Battle 
line 8400=>of Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and  many deeds  of  renown 
line 8401=>were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned 
line 8402=>more than a note in the long annals of the Third Age, but for an  'accident' 
line 8403=>by the way.  The  party was assailed by  Orcs in a  high pass  of  the Misty 
line 8404=>Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was 
line 8405=>lost for a while in the black orc-mines deep under the mountains, and there, 
line 8406=>as he groped  in vain in the dark, he put  his hand on  a ring, lying on the 
line 8407=>floor of a tunnel. He put it in h is pocket. It seemed then like mere luck. 
line 8408=>     Trying to find  his way out. Bilbo went on  down to  the  roots  of the 
line 8409=>mountains, until he could go no further.  At the bottom  of the tunnel lay a  
line 8410=>cold lake far  from the light, and on an island  of rock  in the water lived 
line 8411=>Gollum. He was a loathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his 
line 8412=>large  flat feet,  peering with pale luminous eyes  and  catching blind fish 
line 8413=>with his long fingers, and eating  them raw.  He ate  any living thing, even 
line 8414=>orc, if  he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle. He possessed a  
line 8415=>secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago,  when he  still lived in 
line 8416=>the light: a ring  of gold  that made its  wearer invisible. It was the  one 
line 8417=>thing he  loved, his 'precious', and he talked to  it, even when it  was not 
line 8418=>with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island, except when he 
line 8419=>was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines. 
line 8420=>     Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him 
line 8421=>when they met;  but it was  not, and  the hobbit held  in his hand an Elvish 
line 8422=>knife,  which served him as a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo 
line 8423=>to the Riddle-game,  saying that if he  asked a riddle which Bilbo could not 
line 8424=>
line 8425=>####-guess, then  he would kill him and eat him;  but if Bilbo defeated him, then 
line 8426=>he would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.  
line 8427=>     Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor  
line 8428=>back. Bilbo accepted the challenge; and they asked one another many riddles.  
line 8429=>In the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for 
line 8430=>he was stumped at last  for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand came 
line 8431=>upon the ring he lad picked up and forgotten:  What  haw I got in my pocket? 
line 8432=>This Gollum failed to answer, though he demanded three guesses. 
line 8433=>     The  Authorities, it is true, differ whether  this last  question was a  
line 8434=>mere  'question' and not  a  'riddle' according to  the strict rules  of the 
line 8435=>Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer, 
line 8436=>Gollum was bound by his promise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; 
line 8437=>for 
line 8438=>the  thought  came  to him that  this slimy creature might prove false, even 
line 8439=>though  such  promises  were held sacred, and of old all  but  the wickedest 
line 8440=>things feared to break them. But after ages alone in the dark Gollum's heart 
line 8441=>was black, and  treachery was in it.  He slipped  away, and  returned to the 
line 8442=>island, of which Bilbo knew nothing,  not far off in the dark  water. There, 
line 8443=>he  thought,  lay  his  ring.  He was hungry now,  and angry, and  once  his 
line 8444=>'precious' was with him he would not fear any weapon at all. 
line 8445=>     But the ring was  not on the island; he had  lost it, it was  gone. His 
line 8446=>screech  sent a shiver down Bilbo's back, though he  did not  yet understand 
line 8447=>what  had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped to a guess, too late. What 
line 8448=>has  it got  in its pocketses? he  cried. The light in his eyes  was like  a  
line 8449=>green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his 'precious'.  
line 8450=>Just  in  time Bilbo saw his peril,  and he fled blindly up the passage away 
line 8451=>from the water;  and once more he was saved by his luck. For  just as he ran 
line 8452=>he  put  his  hand in his  pocket, and  the ring  slipped  quietly on to his 
line 8453=>finger. So it was that  Gollum passed him  without seeing him, and  went  to  
line 8454=>guard  the  way out, lest the 'thief' should escape.  Warily Bilbo  followed 
line 8455=>him, as he went along, cursing, and talking to himself about his 'precious';  
line 8456=>from which  talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth,  and hope came to him 
line 8457=>in the darkness: he himself had  found the marvellous  ring and a chance  of 
line 8458=>escape from the orcs and from Gollum. 
line 8459=>     At length they  came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the 
line 8460=>lower  gates  of  the mines,  on the eastward  side of the mountains.  There 
line 8461=>Gollum  crouched at bay, smelling and listening;  and Bilbo  was  tempted to 
line 8462=>
line 8463=>####-slay him with his sword. But  pity stayed him, and though  he kept the ring, 
line 8464=>in  which  his  only hope lay, he  would not  use  it  to  help him kill the 
line 8465=>wretched creature at a disadvantage. In  the  end, gathering his courage, he 
line 8466=>leaped  over  Gollum in the dark, and fled away down the passage, pursued by 
line 8467=>his enemy's cries  of hate and despair: Thief,  thief! Baggins!  We hates it 
line 8468=>for ever! 
line 8469=>     Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told 
line 8470=>it to his companions.  To  them his account was  that Gollum had promised to 
line 8471=>give  him a present, if he  won the game;  but when  Gollum went to fetch it  
line 8472=>from his island he found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been 
line 8473=>given to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this was the  very 
line 8474=>ring  that he  had found, and as he had won the game, it was already  his by 
line 8475=>right. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum 
line 8476=>show him  the way out, as a reward instead of  a present. This account Bilbo 
line 8477=>set down in  his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, not  
line 8478=>even after  the  Council of  Elrond.  Evidently  it  still  appeared in  the 
line 8479=>origina l Red Book, as it  did  in several of the  copies  and abstracts. But 
line 8480=>many copies contain the  true account (as an alternative), derived no  doubt 
line 8481=>from notes by Frodo  or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though they 
line 8482=>seem to have been unwilling to delete anything  actually written by the  old 
line 8483=>hobbit himself. 
line 8484=>     Gandalf, however,  disbelieved Bilbo's first story, as soon as he heard 
line 8485=>it,  and he continued  to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he  got 
line 8486=>the true  tale  out  of  Bilbo  after much questioning,  which for  a  while 
line 8487=>strained  their  friendship;  but  the  wizard seemed  to  think  the  truth 
line 8488=>important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought  it important, 
line 8489=>and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the 
line 8490=>first:  quite contrary to his  habit. The idea of a 'present' was  not  mere 
line 8491=>hobbitlike  invention,  all the  same.  It was  suggested  to Bilbo,  as  he 
line 8492=>confessed, by Gollum's talk that he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call 
line 8493=>the  ring  his 'birthday  present', many times.  That also  Gandalf  thought 
line 8494=>strange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth in  this point for  
line 8495=>many more years, as will be seen in this book. 
line 8496=>     Of  Bilbo's  later adventures little  more need be said here. Wi th  the 
line 8497=>help of the ring he escaped from the orc-guards at the gate and rejoined his 
line 8498=>companions. He  used the ring many times on his  quest, chiefly for the help 
line 8499=>of his  friends; but  he kept it secret from them as long as he could. After  
line 8500=>
line 8501=>####-his return to his home he never spoke  of  it  again to anyone, save Gandalf 
line 8502=>and Frodo;  and no one else  in the  Shire knew of its  existence,  or so he 
line 8503=>believed. Only to Frodo did he show  the account of  his Journey that he was 
line 8504=>writing. 
line 8505=>     His  sword,  Sting, Bilbo hu ng  over his  fireplace,  and  his coat  of 
line 8506=>marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard, he lent to a  
line 8507=>museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a  drawer  
line 8508=>at Bag  End  the old cloak and hood that he had worn on his travels; and the  
line 8509=>ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his pocket. 
line 8510=>     He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in his fifty-second 
line 8511=>year (S.R. 1342),  and nothing very notable occurred in the  Shire until Mr. 
line 8512=>Baggins    began    the   pr eparations   for   the   celebration   of    his 
line 8513=>hundred-and-eleventh birthday  (S.R.  1401).  At  this  point  this  History 
line 8514=>begins.

line 8518=>NOTE ON THE SHIRE RECORDS 
line 8519=>
line 8520=> 
line 8521=> 
line 8522=>     At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great 
line 8523=>events that led  to  the  inclusion  of  the Shire  in the  Reunited Kingdom 
line 8524=>awakened among them a  more widespread  interest in  their own  history; and 
line 8525=>many of their traditions, up to that time still  mainly oral, were collected 
line 8526=>and Written down. The  greater families were  also concerned with  events in 
line 8527=>the  Kingdom  at  large,  and  many  of  their members  studied its  ancient 
line 8528=>histories and  legends. By the  end of the  first century of the Fourth  Age 
line 8529=>there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries tha t contained 
line 8530=>many historical books and records. 
line 8531=>     The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great 
line 8532=>Smials,  and at Brandy Hall.  This  account of the end of  the Third  Age is 
line 8533=>drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. That most important  source 
line 8534=>for 
line 8535=>the  history  of  the War  of  the Ring was so  called because it  was  long 
line 8536=>preserved  at  Undertowers,  the  home  of the Fairbairns,  Wardens  of  the 
line 8537=>Westmarch.1  It was in origin Bilbo's private diary, which he took with  him 
line 8538=>to Rivendell.  Frodo brought  it back to the Shire, together with many loose 
line 8539=>leaves of notes, and during S.R. 1420-1 he nearly filled its pages  with his 
line 8540=>account of the War.  But annexed to  it  and preserved with it, probably m a  
line 8541=>single red case, were  the three large  volumes, bound in  red leather, that 
line 8542=>Bilbo gave  to him as a parting gift. To these four  volumes there was added  
line 8543=>in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies, and various other  
line 8544=>matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship. 
line 8545=>     The original Red Book has  not been  preserved, but  many  copies  were 
line 8546=>made,  especially of the first volume, for the use of the descendants of the 
line 8547=>children  of  Master  Samwise.  The  most  important  copy, however,  has  a  
line 8548=>different history.  It  was kept at  Great  Smials,  but it  was written  in 
line 8549=>Condor,  probably at  the  request  of the  great-grandson  of Peregrin, and 
line 8550=>completed in S.R. 1592  (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this  note: 
line 8551=>Findegil,  King's Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It  is an exact copy 
line 8552=>in  all details of the Thain's Book  m Minas Tirith.  That book was  a copy, 
line 8553=>made at the request of King Elessar,  of the Red Book of the Periannath, and 
line 8554=>
line 8555=>####-was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64 . 
line 8556=>     The Thain's Book was  thus  the first copy made of  the  Red  Book  and 
line 8557=>contained much that was later omitted or lost.  In Minas  Tirith it received 
line 8558=>much  annotation, and  many  corrections, especially  of  names,  words, and 
line 8559=>quotations in the Elvish languages; and there was added to it an abbreviated  
line 8560=>version of those  parts of The  Tale of Aragorn  and Arwen which lie outside 
line 8561=>the  account of the War. The full tale  is  stated  to have been written  by 
line 8562=>Barahir, grandson of the Steward Faramir, some time after the passing of the  
line 8563=>King. But the chief importance of  Findegil's copy is that it alone contains 
line 8564=>the whole  of Bilbo's 'Translations from the  Elvish'. These  three  volumes 
line 8565=>were  found to be a work of great skill and learning in  which, between 1403 
line 8566=>and 1418, he had used all the sources  available to  him  in Rivendell, both 
line 8567=>living and written. But  since they were little used by Frodo, being  almost  
line 8568=>entirely concerned with the Elder Days, no more is said of them here. 
line 8569=>     Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the  heads  of their great families,  
line 8570=>and  at the  same time kept up their  connexions with Rohan and  Gondor, the 
line 8571=>libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did  not  appear 
line 8572=>in the Red Book.  In Brandy Hall there were many works dealing  with Eriador  
line 8573=>and the  history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or  begun by 
line 8574=>Meriadoc 
line 8575=>himself, though in the  Shire he was chiefly remembered for  his Herblore of 
line 8576=>the Shire, and for his Reckoning of  Years m which he discussed the relation 
line 8577=>of the calendars of the Shire and Bree  to those of  Rivendell,  Gondor, and 
line 8578=>Rohan. He also wrote a short treatise on Old Words and Names  in the  Shire, 
line 8579=>having special interest  in discovering the kinship with the language of the 
line 8580=>Rohirrim of such 'shire-words' as mathom and old elements in place names. 
line 8581=>     At Great Smials the books were  of less interest to Shire-folk,  though 
line 8582=>more important for larger history. None of them was written by Peregrin, but 
line 8583=>he and  his successors  collected  many manuscripts written  by  scribes  of 
line 8584=>Gondor:  mainly  copies  or  summaries of  histories or legends  relating to 
line 8585=>Elendil  and his heirs. Only  here in the Shire were to  be  found extensive 
line 8586=>materials for  the history  of  N®menor and the  arising of  Sauron.  It was 
line 8587=>probably at Great Smials that The Tale of Years1 was put  together, with the 
line 8588=>assistance of material  collected by Meriadoc. Though  the dates  given  are 
line 8589=>often conjectural, especially for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It 
line 8590=>is   probable  that  Mer iadoc  obtained   assistance  and  information  from 
line 8591=>Rivendell,  which he  visited  more  than  once.  There, though  Elrond  had 
line 8592=>
line 8593=>####-departed, his sons long remained, together with some of the High-elven folk. 
line 8594=>It  is  said  that  Celeborn  went  to  dwell  there after the departure  of 
line 8595=>Galadriel; but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey 
line 8596=>Havens,  and  with  him went the last  living  memory  of the  Elder Days in  
line 8597=>Middle-earth.

line 8600=>
line 8601=> 
line 8602=> 
line 8603=>
line 8604=>Chapter 1. A Long-expected Party 
line 8605=>
line 8606=> 
line 8607=> 
line 8608=>     When  Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag  End announced that  he would shortly be 
line 8609=>celebrating   his   eleventy-first  birthday   with  a   party  of   special 
line 8610=>magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. 
line 8611=>     Bilbo  was very rich  and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the 
line 8612=>Shire  for  sixty   years,  ever  since  his  remarkable  disappearance  and 
line 8613=>unexpected return. The riches  he  had brought back from his travels had now 
line 8614=>become  a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk  
line 8615=>might  say,  that  the Hill  at Bag  End was  full  of tunnels  stuffed with 
line 8616=>treasure. And if that was not enough for  fame, there was also his prolonged  
line 8617=>vigour  to marvel at. Time wore on,  but it seemed to  have little effect on 
line 8618=>Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they 
line 8619=>began to  call him well-preserved,  but unchanged would have been nearer the 
line 8620=>mark. There were  some that shook their heads and thought  this was too much 
line 8621=>of  a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should  possess  (apparently)  
line 8622=>perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth. 
line 8623=>     'It  will  have  to be  paid for,'  they said. 'It  isn't natural,  and 
line 8624=>trouble will come of it!' 
line 8625=>     But so far trouble had not come;  and as Mr. Baggins was  generous with 
line 8626=>his money, most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good 
line 8627=>fortune.  He  remained  on visiting  terms with  his  relatives (except,  of 
line 8628=>course, the Sackville-Bagginses), and he had many devoted admirers among 
line 8629=>the 
line 8630=>hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until 
line 8631=>some of his younger cousins began to grow up. 
line 8632=>     The eldest of  these,  and Bilbo's favourite,  was young Frodo Baggins. 
line 8633=>When Bilbo was ninety-nine, he adopted Frodo as his heir, and brought him to 
line 8634=>live  at Bag End;  and the  hopes  of the  Sackville-Bagginses were  finally 
line 8635=>dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the same  birthday, September 
line 8636=>22nd. 
line 8637=>'You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,' said  Bilbo one day; 'and 
line 8638=>then we  can  celebrate our birthday-parties  comfortably together.' At that 
line 8639=>
line 8640=>####-time Frodo  was still in his tweens, as the hobbits called the irresponsible 
line 8641=>twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three. 
line 8642=>     Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses  had given very lively 
line 8643=>combined  birthday-parties  at  Bag  End;  but  now  it  was understood that 
line 8644=>something  quite  exceptional was being planned  for that autumn.  Bilbo was 
line 8645=>going  to  be  eleventy -one,  111,  a  rather  curious  number  and  a  very 
line 8646=>respectable  age  for a hobbit (the Old Took  himself had only reached 130); 
line 8647=>and Frodo was going to be thirty- three, 33) an important number: the date of 
line 8648=>his 'coming of age'.  
line 8649=>     Tongues began to wag in  Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming 
line 8650=>event travelled all  over the Shire. The  history and character of Mr. Bilbo 
line 8651=>Baggins became once again the  chief  topic of  conversation; and the  older  
line 8652=>folk suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand. 
line 8653=>     No one  had  a  more attentive audience than old Ham  Gamgee,  commonly 
line 8654=>known as  the  Gaffer. He held forth  at  The Ivy Bush,  a small inn on  the 
line 8655=>Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden 
line 8656=>at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job befor e 
line 8657=>that. Now that he was himself  growing old  and stiff in the joints, the job 
line 8658=>was mainly  carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father  and son 
line 8659=>were on very friendly  terms with Bilbo and  Frodo. They  lived  on the Hill  
line 8660=>itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End. 
line 8661=>     'A very nice  well-spoken  gentlehobbit  is  Mr.  Bilbo, as I've always 
line 8662=>said,' the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo was very polite to 
line 8663=>him, calling him 'Master Hamfast', and consulting  him  constantly upon  the 
line 8664=>growing  of vegetables  - in the matter of 'roots', especially  potatoes, the 
line 8665=>Gaffer was recognized as the  leading authority  by all in the neighbourhood 
line 8666=>(including himself). 
line 8667=>     'But  what about this Frodo that lives with  him?'  asked Old Noakes of 
line 8668=>Bywater.  'Baggins is his name, but he's more than  half a  Brandybuck, they 
line 8669=>say. It beats me why any Baggins  of  Hobbiton should go looking for a  wife 
line 8670=>away there in Buckland, where folks are so queer.' 
line 8671=>     'And no  wonder they're queer,'  put  in  Daddy  Twofoot  (the Gaffer's 
line 8672=>next-door neighbour),  'if they live  on  the wrong  side of the  Brandywine 
line 8673=>River, and right agin  the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half  the 
line 8674=>tales be true.' 
line 8675=>     'You're right,  Dad!' said  the  Gaffer. 'Not  that  the Brandybucks of 
line 8676=>Buck-land live in the Old Forest; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They  
line 8677=>
line 8678=>####-fool about  with boats on that big  river   - and that  isn't  natural. Small 
line 8679=>wonder that trouble came of  it,  I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is 
line 8680=>as nice a young hobbit  as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, 
line 8681=>and in  more than  looks.  After all his  father  was  a Baggins.  A  decent 
line 8682=>respectable hobbit was Mr. Drogo  Baggins; there  was never much to tell  of 
line 8683=>him, till he was drownded.' 
line 8684=>     'Drownded?' said several  voices. They  had heard this and other darker  
line 8685=>rumours before, of course; but  hobbits have a passion  for  family history, 
line 8686=>and they were ready to hear  it again. 'Well, so they say,' said the Gaffer. 
line 8687=>'You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss  Primula Brandybuck.  She  was 
line 8688=>our 
line 8689=>Mr. Bilbo's first cousin on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest 
line 8690=>of the Old Took's  daughters); and Mr.  Drogo  was his second cousin. So Mr. 
line 8691=>Frodo is his first and second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying 
line 8692=>is,  if  you  follow me.  And Mr. Drogo was  staying at Brandy Hall with his 
line 8693=>father -in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often  did after his marriage (him 
line 8694=>being partial to  his vittles,  and old  Gorbadoc keeping  a mighty generous 
line 8695=>table); and he went out boating on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife 
line 8696=>were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all. ' 
line 8697=>     'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,' said 
line 8698=>Old Noakes; 'and it was Drogo's weight as sunk the boat.' 
line 8699=>     'And I heard she pushed him in, and  he pulled her in after him,'  said 
line 8700=>Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller. 
line 8701=>     'You shouldn't listen  to all you hear, Sandyman,' said the Gaffer, who 
line 8702=>did not much like the miller. 'There isn't no  call to go ta lking of pushing 
line 8703=>and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit  still without 
line 8704=>looking  further for the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this  Mr. Frodo  
line 8705=>left  an  orphan  and  stranded,  as  you  might   say,  among  those  queer  
line 8706=>Bucklanders,  being brought  up anyhow  in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by 
line 8707=>all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than  a couple  of hundred 
line 8708=>relations in  the place.  Mr. Bilbo  never did  a kinder  deed  than when he 
line 8709=>brought the lad back to live among decent folk. 
line 8710=>     'But I  reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They  
line 8711=>thought  they were going to get Bag End,  that time when he went off and was 
line 8712=>thought to be dead.  And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes 
line 8713=>on living and living, and never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly 
line 8714=>he  produces  an  heir,  and  has  all  the  papers  made  out  proper.  The 
line 8715=>
line 8716=>####-Sackville-Bagginses won't never  see the inside of Bag End now, or it  is to 
line 8717=>be hoped not.' 
line 8718=>     'There's a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,' said a  
line 8719=>stranger,  a visitor on  business from  Michel Delving in the  Westfarthing. 
line 8720=>'All the top of  your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and 
line 8721=>silver, and jools, by what I've heard. ' 
line 8722=>     'Then you've heard  more than I  can speak  to,' answered the Gaffer. I 
line 8723=>know nothing about  jools.  Mr. Bilbo is free with  his money, and there seems 
line 8724=>no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel -making. I  saw Mr. Bilbo when he came 
line 8725=>back, a matter of  sixty  years  ago,  when I was a  lad. I'd  not long come 
line 8726=>prentice to old  Holman (him being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at Bag 
line 8727=>End helping  him  to keep folks from trampling and  trapessing  all over the 
line 8728=>garden while the sale was on. And in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up 
line 8729=>the Hill  with  a pony and some mighty big  bags and a couple  of  chests. I 
line 8730=>don't  doubt  they were mostly full of treasure  he had picked up in foreign 
line 8731=>parts, where there be mountains of gold, they  say;  but there wasn't enough 
line 8732=>to fill tunnels. But  my lad Sam will know  more about that. He's in and out 
line 8733=>of Bag End. Crazy about stories of the old days he is, and he listens to all 
line 8734=>Mr. Bilbo's  tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters  - meaning no harm, 
line 8735=>mark you, and I hope no harm will come of it. 
line 8736=>     'Elves and Dragons' I says  to him. 'Cabbages and  potatoes are  better 
line 8737=>for me and  you. Don't go getting mixed up in  the business of your betters, 
line 8738=>or you'll land in trouble  too big for you,' I says  to him. And I might say 
line 8739=>it to others,' he added with a look at the stranger and the miller. 
line 8740=>     But the Gaffer did  not convince  his audience. The  legend  of Bilbo's 
line 8741=>wealth was now too  firmly fixed in the minds  of the  younger generation of  
line 8742=>hobbits. 
line 8743=>     'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,' 
line 8744=>argued the miller, voicing common  opinion. 'He's often  away from home. And 
line 8745=>look at the outlandish  folk that visit him:  dwarves  coming at night,  and 
line 8746=>that old wandering conjuror, Gandalf,  and  all. You can say  what you like, 
line 8747=>Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.' 
line 8748=>     'And you can say what you like, about what you know no more of than you  
line 8749=>do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,' retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even 
line 8750=>more  than usual. If  that's being queer, then we could do  with a bit  more 
line 8751=>queerness in these parts. There's  some  not  far away that wouldn't offer a  
line 8752=>pint of beer to a friend, if they  lived  in  a hole with golden  walls. But 
line 8753=>
line 8754=>####-they do things proper at Bag End. Our  Sam says that  everyone's going to be 
line 8755=>invited to the party, and there's  going to be presents, mark you,  presents 
line 8756=>for all - this very month as is.' 
line 8757=>     That very month  was  September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or  
line 8758=>two  later a rumour (probably  started by the knowledgeable Sam)  was spread 
line 8759=>about  that there were going to be fireworks  - fireworks, what is more, such 
line 8760=>as had not been seen in the Shire for nigh  on a  century, not indeed  since 
line 8761=>the Old Took died. 
line 8762=>     Days passed  and The Day drew nearer.  An odd-looking waggon laden with 
line 8763=>odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening and toiled up the Hill 
line 8764=>to  Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. 
line 8765=>It was driven  by outlandish  folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long 
line 8766=>beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End.  At the end of the 
line 8767=>second week in September a cart came in  through Bywater from the  direction 
line 8768=>of the  Brandywine Bridge in  broad daylight. An old  man was driving it all  
line 8769=>alone.  He  wore a tall pointed blue hat,  a  long grey cloak,  and a silver  
line 8770=>scarf. He  had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows  that stuck  out beyond 
line 8771=>the  brim of  his  hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through 
line 8772=>Hobbiton and right up the hill. It ha d a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly 
line 8773=>guessed. At Bilbo's front door the old man began to unload: there were great 
line 8774=>bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red 
line 8775=>G and the elf-rune, . 
line 8776=>     That was Gandalf's mark, of course,  and the  old man  was Gandalf  the 
line 8777=>Wizard,  whose  fame in the Shire  was  due mainly to  his skill with fires,  
line 8778=>smokes, and lights.  His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, 
line 8779=>but  the Shire-folk knew nothing about  it. To them  he was just one  of the 
line 8780=>'attractions'  at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children.  'G  
line 8781=>for Grand!' they  shouted, and the old man smiled.  They knew him by  sight, 
line 8782=>though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long; but 
line 8783=>neither they nor  any  but  the  oldest of  their elders had seen one of his 
line 8784=>firework displays  - they now belonged to the legendary past. 
line 8785=>     When the old  man,  helped by  Bilbo  and  some  dwarves,  had finished  
line 8786=>unloading. Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but not a single squib or  cracker  
line 8787=>was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers.  
line 8788=>     'Run  away now!' said  Gandalf.  'You  will  get plenty  when  the time 
line 8789=>comes.' Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door  was  shut.  The 
line 8790=>young  hobbits  stared at  the door  in vain for a while, and then made off, 
line 8791=>
line 8792=>####-feeling that the day of the party would never come. 
line 8793=>     Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window  of a  
line 8794=>small room looking out west on to the garden.  The late afternoon was br ight  
line 8795=>and   peaceful.  The  flowers  glowed   red  and  golden:  snap-dragons  and 
line 8796=>sun-flowers, and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in 
line 8797=>at the round windows.  
line 8798=>     'How bright your garden looks!' said Gandalf. 
line 8799=>     'Yes,' said Bilbo. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old 
line 8800=>Shire; but I think I need a holiday.' 
line 8801=>     'You mean to go on with your plan then?' 
line 8802=>     'I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven't changed it.' 
line 8803=>     'Very  well.  It is no good saying any  more.  Stick to your plan  - your 
line 8804=>whole plan, mind  - and I hope it will turn out for the best, for  you,  and 
line 8805=>for all of us.' 
line 8806=>     'I hope  so.  Anyway  I mean to enjoy  myself on Thursday, and  have my 
line 8807=>little joke.' 
line 8808=>     'Who will laugh, I wonder?' said Gandalf, shaking his head. 
line 8809=>     'We shall see,' said Bilbo. 
line 8810=>     The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There 
line 8811=>might have  been  some grumbling about 'dealing locally', but that very week 
line 8812=>orders began to pour out of Bag End for every  kind of provision, commodity, 
line 8813=>or luxury  that  could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the 
line 8814=>neighbourhood.  People  became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off  the 
line 8815=>days on  the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the  postman, hoping for  
line 8816=>invitations.  
line 8817=>     Before long  the  invitations  began  pouring  out,  and  the  Hobbiton 
line 8818=>post-office  was blocked, and the Bywater post -office  was snowed under, and 
line 8819=>voluntary assistant postmen were called for.  There was a constant stream of 
line 8820=>them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank you, 
line 8821=>I shall certainly come. 
line 8822=>     A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT 
line 8823=>ON PARTY 
line 8824=>BUSINESS. Even those  who had, or  pretended  to  have  Party  Business were 
line 8825=>seldom allowed inside. Bilbo  was  busy:  writing invitations,  ticking  off 
line 8826=>answers, packing up presents, and making  some  private preparations  of his 
line 8827=>own. From the time of Gandalf's arrival he remained hidden from view.  
line 8828=>     One morning the hobbits woke to find  the large field,  south of Bilbo's 
line 8829=>
line 8830=>####-front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents  and pavilions. A special 
line 8831=>entrance  was cut into the bank leading to  the road, and wide steps  and  a  
line 8832=>large white gate were built there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row,  
line 8833=>adjoining the field, were intensely  interested  and  generally envied.  Old 
line 8834=>Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden. 
line 8835=>     The tents began to  go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big 
line 8836=>that the tree that grew in the   field was right inside it, and stood proudly 
line 8837=>near one end, at the head of  the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its 
line 8838=>branches. More  promising still (to the hobbits' mind): an enormous open-air  
line 8839=>kitchen was erected in the  north corner of  the field. A draught  of cooks, 
line 8840=>from every inn and eating-house  for miles around, arrived to supplement the 
line 8841=>dwarves and other odd  folk  that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose 
line 8842=>to its height. 
line 8843=>     Then the weather  clouded  over.  That was on Wednesday the  eve of the  
line 8844=>Party.  Anxiety was  intense. Then Thursday,  September  the 22nd,  actually 
line 8845=>dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun 
line 8846=>began. 
line 8847=>     Bilbo  Baggins called it  a  party,  but it  was really  a  variety  of 
line 8848=>entertainments  rolled  into one.  Practically  everybody  living  near  was 
line 8849=>invited. A very few were overlooked  by accident, but  as they turned up all 
line 8850=>the same, that did not matter.  Many people  from other parts of  the  Shire 
line 8851=>were also asked; and there were even  a few from outside the  borders. Bilbo  
line 8852=>met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. He gave away 
line 8853=>presents to all and sundry - the latter were  those  who went out again by a  
line 8854=>back way  and came  in  again by  the gate. Hobbits give   presents  to other  
line 8855=>people  on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a  rule, and not 
line 8856=>so lavishly  as on this  occasion; but it was  not a bad system. Actually in 
line 8857=>Hobbiton  and Bywater every  day in the year it was somebody's  birthday, so 
line 8858=>that every  hobbit  in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present 
line 8859=>at least once a week. But they never got tired of them. 
line 8860=>     On this occasion the presents were unusually  good. The hobbit-children 
line 8861=>were so excited that for a while they almost forgot  about eating. There were 
line 8862=>toys the like  of which they had  never seen before, all beautiful and  some 
line 8863=>obviously magical.  Many of them had indeed been ordered a year before,  and 
line 8864=>had  come  all  the way  from  the Mountain and from Dale, and  were of real 
line 8865=>dwarf-make. 
line 8866=>     When  every guest had been  welcomed  and was finally inside the  gate,  
line 8867=>
line 8868=>####-there were  songs, dances, music, games,  and,  of course,  food  and drink. 
line 8869=>There were  three  official  meals: lunch,  tea, and dinner (or supper). But 
line 8870=>lunch and  tea were marked chiefly by  the fact that at  those times all the 
line 8871=>guests  were sitting  down and eating together. At  other  times  there were 
line 8872=>merely lots  of  people  eating and drinking  -  continuously from elevenses 
line 8873=>until six-thirty, when the fireworks  started. 
line 8874=>     The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought  by  him, but 
line 8875=>designed and made by  him; and the  special effects, set pieces, and flights 
line 8876=>of rockets were let off by him. But  there was  also a generous distribution 
line 8877=>of  squibs,  crackers,  backarappers,   sparklers,  torches,  dwarf-candles,  
line 8878=>elf-fountains, goblin-barkers  and thunder -claps. They  were all superb. The 
line 8879=>art of Gandalf improved with age. 
line 8880=>     There were  rockets like  a flight  of scintillating birds singing with 
line 8881=>sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves  
line 8882=>opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches 
line 8883=>dropped glowing flowers down upon the  astonished hobbits, disappearing with 
line 8884=>a  sweet  scent just  before they touched  their  upturned faces. There were 
line 8885=>fountains  of butterflies that flew  glittering into  the trees;  there were 
line 8886=>pillars  of  coloured  fires that rose  and  turned into eagles, or  sailing 
line 8887=>ships,  or  a  phalanx of flying swans; there was a red  thunderstorm  and a  
line 8888=>shower  of  yellow  rain; there was a  forest  of silver spears  that sprang 
line 8889=>suddenly  into the  air with a  yell like an embattled  army, and came  down 
line 8890=>again into the Water with a hiss like a  hundred hot snakes.  And there  was 
line 8891=>also one last surprise,  in  honour of Bilbo,  and  it startled  the hobbits 
line 8892=>exceedingly, as  Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great  smoke  went 
line 8893=>up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow 
line 8894=>at  the summit. It spouted green  and scarlet flames. Out flew a  red-golden 
line 8895=>dragon - not life-size, but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his 
line 8896=>eyes glared down; there  was  a  roar, and he whizzed three  times  over the 
line 8897=>heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and  many fell fla t on their faces. The 
line 8898=>dragon passed like an  express train,  turned a  somersault, and  burst over  
line 8899=>Bywater with a deafening explosion. 
line 8900=>     'That is  the  signal for  supper!'  said  Bilbo.  The  pain  and alarm 
line 8901=>vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits  leaped to their feet. There  was 
line 8902=>a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that  is, except those invited 
line 8903=>to the special family dinner -party. This was held in the great pavilion with 
line 8904=>the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called 
line 8905=>
line 8906=>####-by the hobbits one Gross, though  the  word was not considered proper to use 
line 8907=>of people); and  the  guests were selected  from  all  the families to which 
line 8908=>Bilbo and Frodo were related, with  the addition of a  few special unrelated 
line 8909=>friends (such as Gandalf). Many young hobbits  were included, and present by 
line 8910=>parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in  the 
line 8911=>matter  of  sitting up late,  especially when there  was a chance of getting 
line 8912=>them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender. 
line 8913=>     There  were  many  Bagginses  and  Boffins,  and also  many  Tooks  and 
line 8914=>Brandybucks;  there  were  various  Grubbs   (relations  of  Bilbo  Baggins' 
line 8915=>grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and a 
line 8916=>selection  of  Burrowses,  Bolgers, Bracegirdles,  Brockhouses,  Goodbodies, 
line 8917=>Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly 
line 8918=>connected 
line 8919=>with Bilbo, and  some of them  had hardly ever  been in Hobbiton before,  as 
line 8920=>they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses  were not 
line 8921=>forgotten.  Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo  and 
line 8922=>detested Frodo,  but  so magnificent  was the invitation  card,  written  in 
line 8923=>golden ink, that  they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides,  their 
line 8924=>cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing  in  food for many years and  his table 
line 8925=>had a high reputation. 
line 8926=>     All  the  one hundred  and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; 
line 8927=>though they  rather  dreaded  the  after -dinner  speech  of their  host  (an 
line 8928=>inevitable item). He was liable to drag  in bits of  what he  called poetry; 
line 8929=>and sometimes, after  a glass or two, would  allude to the absurd adventures 
line 8930=>of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a very 
line 8931=>pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, 
line 8932=>and prolonged. The  purchase of provisions fell almost to nothing throughout 
line 8933=>the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo's catering had  depleted the 
line 8934=>stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not 
line 8935=>matter much. 
line 8936=>     After  the feast (more or less) came the  Speech. Most of  the  company 
line 8937=>were, however, now in a tolerant  mood, at that  delightful stage which they 
line 8938=>called 'filling up  the corners'.  They were sipping their favourite drinks,  
line 8939=>and nibbling at  their favourite  dainties, and their fears  were forgotten. 
line 8940=>They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop. 
line 8941=>     My dear People, began Bilbo, rising in  his  place. 'Hear! Hear! Hear!' 
line 8942=>they shouted,  and  kept on repeating  it  in chorus,  seeming  reluctant to 
line 8943=>
line 8944=>####-follow their own advice. Bilbo left  his place and went and stood on a chair 
line 8945=>under the illuminated  tree. The  light of the lanterns fell on his  beaming 
line 8946=>face; the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could 
line 8947=>all see  him standing,  waving  one hand in  the air,  the other  was in his 
line 8948=>trouser-pocket. 
line 8949=>     My dear Bagginses and Boffins, he began again;  and my  dear  Tooks and 
line 8950=>Brandybucks, and Grubbs,  and  Chubbs,  and Burrowses,  and Hornblowers, 
line 8951=>and 
line 8952=>Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses and Proudfoots.  
line 8953=>'ProudFEET!' 
line 8954=>shouted  an  elderly  hobbit  from  the back  of the pavilion.  His name, of 
line 8955=>course, was  Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet were large, exceptionally 
line 8956=>furry, and both were on the table. 
line 8957=>     Proudfoots,  repeated Bilbo. Also my  good  Sackville -Bagginses that  I 
line 8958=>welcome  back at last  to  Bag  End. Today  is my  one  hundred and eleventh  
line 8959=>birthday: I am eleventy -one  today! 'Hurray!  Hurray! Many  Happy  Returns!' 
line 8960=>they  shouted, and they  hammered  joyously  on the tables.  Bilbo was doing 
line 8961=>splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.  
line 8962=>     / hope you  are  all  enjoying yourselves as much as  I  am.  Deafening 
line 8963=>cheers. Cries  of  Yes  (and  No). Noises  of trumpets and horns, pipes  and 
line 8964=>flutes,  and  other musical instruments.  There were, as has been said, many 
line 8965=>young hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of 
line 8966=>them bore the  mark DALE  on them; which did not  convey much to most of 
line 8967=>the 
line 8968=>hobbits, but they all agreed they were  marvellous crackers.  They contained 
line 8969=>instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one 
line 8970=>corner some of  the young Tooks and  Brandybucks, supposing Uncle  Bilbo  to 
line 8971=>have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up 
line 8972=>an impromptu orchestra, and began a  merry dance-tune.  Master  Everard Took  
line 8973=>and  Miss Melilot Brandybuck  got on a  table  and with bells in their hands 
line 8974=>began to dance the Springle-ring: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous. 
line 8975=>     But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he 
line 8976=>blew  three loud  hoots. The noise subsided. /  shall not keep you  long, he 
line 8977=>cried. Cheers from all the assembly. /  have called  you all  together for a  
line 8978=>Purpose. Something in  the way  that he said this made an impression.  There 
line 8979=>was almost silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears. 
line 8980=>     Indeed,  for  Three  Purposes! First of  all,  to  tell  you that  I am 
line 8981=>
line 8982=>####-immensely fond  of  you all, and that eleventy -one years is too short a time 
line 8983=>to live among such  excellent and  admirable hobbits. Tremendous outburst of 
line 8984=>approval. 
line 8985=>     / don't know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less 
line 8986=>than half of you half as well as you deserve. This was unexpected and rather  
line 8987=>difficult. There  was some scattered clapping, but most of  them were trying 
line 8988=>to work it out and see if it came to a compliment. 
line 8989=>     Secondly,  to  celebrate my birthday.  Cheers again.  / should say: OUR 
line 8990=>birthday.  For it  is, of  course, also the birthday of my  heir and nephew,  
line 8991=>Frodo.  He comes  of  age  and into his inheritance today. Some  perfunctory 
line 8992=>clapping by the  elders;  and some loud  shouts of 'Frodo!  Frodo! Jolly old 
line 8993=>Frodo,' from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered what 
line 8994=>was  meant by 'coming  into his inheritance'. Together we score one  hundred  
line 8995=>and forty -four.  Your numbers were chosen to  fit this remarkable total: One 
line 8996=>Gross, if I  may use the  expression. No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of 
line 8997=>his guests, and especially  the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted,  feeling 
line 8998=>sure they had only been asked to fill up the  required number, like goods in 
line 8999=>a package. 'One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.' 
line 9000=>     It is also,  if  I  may be  allowed to  refer to  ancient history,  the 
line 9001=>anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long Lake; though the 
line 9002=>fact that it was  my birthday slipped  my memory on that occasion. I was only  
line 9003=>fifty-one  then,  and birthdays did  not seem so important.  The banquet was  
line 9004=>very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and 
line 9005=>could only say 'thag you very  buch'. I now repeat  it more correctly: Thank 
line 9006=>you  very  much for coming  to my little party. Obstinate  silence. They all  
line 9007=>feared that  a song or some poetry was now imminent;  and they  were getting 
line 9008=>bored. Why couldn't he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo  
line 9009=>did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment. 
line 9010=>     Thirdly  and finally, he said,  I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT. He 
line 9011=>spoke 
line 9012=>this last word so  loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. 
line 9013=>I regret to announce that - though, as I said, eleventy -one years is far too 
line 9014=>short a time to spend among you - this is the END. I am going. I  am leaving 
line 9015=>NOW. GOOD-BYE! 
line 9016=>     He stepped down and  vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and 
line 9017=>the guests  all blinked. When they opened their eyes Bilbo was nowhere to be 
line 9018=>seen. One hundred  and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless.  
line 9019=>
line 9020=>####-Old  Odo Proudfoot  removed his feet from the table and stamped. Then  there 
line 9021=>was  a  dead  silence,  until  suddenly, after  several deep breaths,  every 
line 9022=>Baggins,  Boffin,   Took,   Brandybuck,   Grubb,  Chubb,  Burrows,   Bolger, 
line 9023=>Bracegirdle,  Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and  Proudfoot began to 
line 9024=>talk  
line 9025=>at once. 
line 9026=>     It  was generally agreed that the joke was  in very bad taste, and more 
line 9027=>food and drink were needed to cure the guests  of shock and annoyance. 'He's 
line 9028=>mad. I always said so,'  was probably  the  most  popular comment.  Even the 
line 9029=>Tooks (with a few exceptions) thought  Bilbo's behaviour was absurd. For the 
line 9030=>moment most of  them took it for granted that his disappearance was  nothing 
line 9031=>more than a ridiculous prank. 
line 9032=>     But old Rory Brandybuck was not  so sure. Neither age  nor an  enormous 
line 9033=>dinner  had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter -in-law, Esmeralda: 
line 9034=>'There's something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off 
line 9035=>again. Silly old fool. But why worry? He hasn't taken the vittles with him.' 
line 9036=>He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again. 
line 9037=>     Frodo  was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time  he 
line 9038=>had  sat silent  beside  Bilbo's  empty  chair,  and ignored all remarks and 
line 9039=>questions. He had enjoyed the  joke,  of course, even  though he had been in 
line 9040=>the  know. He had  difficulty  in  keeping  from  laughter at the  indignant 
line 9041=>surprise of  the guests.  But  at the  same time he felt deeply troubled: he 
line 9042=>realized  suddenly  that he loved the old hobbit  dearly. Most of the guests 
line 9043=>went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins' oddities, past and 
line 9044=>present;  but the Sackville-Bagginses had already  departed in wrath.  Frodo 
line 9045=>did not want to have any more  to do with the party. He gave orders for more 
line 9046=>wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass  silently to the 
line 9047=>health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion. 
line 9048=>     As for Bilbo Baggins,  even while he was making his speech, he had been 
line 9049=>fingering the golden ring   in his pocket:  his magic ring that he  had  kept 
line 9050=>secret for so many years. As he  stepped  down he slipped it on his  finger, 
line 9051=>and he was never seen by any hobbit in Hobbiton again. 
line 9052=>     He walked  briskly back to his hole, and stood  for a moment  listening 
line 9053=>with a smile to the din in  the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in 
line 9054=>other parts  of the field. Then he  went in.  He took off his party clothes,  
line 9055=>folded up and wrapped  in tissue-paper his  embroidered  silk waistcoat, and 
line 9056=>put it away. Then he put on quickly  some old untidy  garments, and fastened 
line 9057=>
line 9058=>####-round his  waist a  worn leather  belt.  On it  he  hung a short sword in  a  
line 9059=>battered  black-leather  scabbard.  From  a  locked  drawer,   smelling   of 
line 9060=>moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood . They had been locked up as if 
line 9061=>they were very precious, but they were  so  patched and weatherstained  that 
line 9062=>their  original  colour  could hardly be guessed: it might  have  been  dark 
line 9063=>green. They were rather too large for him. He then  went into his study, and 
line 9064=>from  a  large  strong-box  took out a bundle  wrapped in  old cloths, and a  
line 9065=>leather -bound  manuscript; and  also a large bulky  envelope.  The  book and  
line 9066=>bundle  he stuffed  into  the top  of a heavy  bag  that was standing there, 
line 9067=>already nearly full.  Into the envelope he slipped his  golden ring, and its 
line 9068=>fine chain, and then  sealed it, and addressed it  to Frodo. At first he put 
line 9069=>it  on the mantelpiece,  but  suddenly  he  removed it and  stuck  it in his 
line 9070=>pocket. At that moment the door opened and Gandalf came quickly in. 
line 9071=>     'Hullo!' said Bilbo. 'I wondered if you would turn up.' 
line 9072=>     'I am glad to find you visible,' replied the wizard, sitting down  in a  
line 9073=>chair, 'I wanted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel 
line 9074=>that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?' 
line 9075=>     'Yes,  I do,' said  Bilbo. "Though that flash was surprising: it  quite 
line 9076=>startled  me,  let alone the  others. A  little  addition  of  your  own,  I 
line 9077=>suppose?' 
line 9078=>     It was. You have  wisely kept that ring secret all these  years, and it 
line 9079=>seemed to me necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to 
line 9080=>explain your sudden vanishment.' 
line 9081=>     'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,' laughed 
line 9082=>Bilbo, 'but I expect you know best, as usual.' 
line 9083=>     'I do - when I  know  anything. But I  don't  feel too  sure about this 
line 9084=>whole affair. It has now come  to the  final point. You have had  your joke, 
line 9085=>and alarmed or offended most  of your relations, and  given the whole  Shire 
line 9086=>something to talk about for nine  days, or ninety-nine more  likely. Are you  
line 9087=>going any further?' 
line 9088=>     'Yes, I am. I feel  I  need a holiday, a very  long holiday, as I  have 
line 9089=>told  you before. Probably  a  permanent holiday:  I  don't expect  I  shall 
line 9090=>return. In fact, I don't mean to, and I have made all arrangements. 
line 9091=>     'I  am  old, Gandalf. I don't look it, but I am beginning to feel it in 
line 9092=>my heart  of hearts.  Well-preserved indeed!' he snorted.  'Why, I feel  all 
line 9093=>thin, sort of stretched, if you  know what I mean: like butter that has been 
line 9094=>scraped  over too  much bread.  That can't  be right. I need  a  change,  or  
line 9095=>
line 9096=>####-something.' 
line 9097=>     Gandalf  looked curiously  and closely at him.  'No,  it does not  seem 
line 9098=>right,' he said thoughtfully. 'No, after all I believe your plan is probably 
line 9099=>the best.' 
line 9100=>     'Well, I've made  up  my mind,  anyway. I  want to see mountains again, 
line 9101=>Gandalf, mountains, and then  find somewhere where I can  rest. In peace and 
line 9102=>quiet, without a lot  of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded 
line 9103=>visitors hanging on the bell.  I might find somewhere where I  can finish my 
line 9104=>book. I  have thought  of  a nice ending for it:  and he lived happily  ever 
line 9105=>after to the end of his days. ' 
line 9106=>     Gandalf laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however  
line 9107=>it ends.' 
line 9108=>     'Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as 
line 9109=>it has gone. You'll keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?' 
line 9110=>     'Yes, I will  - two eyes, as often as I can spare them.' 
line 9111=>     'He would come with  me, of  course, if I asked him. In fact he offered 
line 9112=>to once, just before the party. But he does not really want to, yet.  I want 
line 9113=>to  see  the  wild country again before I die, and  the Mountains; but he is 
line 9114=>still in love with the Shire, with woods and  fields  and  little rivers. He 
line 9115=>ought to  be comfortable here. I  am leaving everything  to him,  of course, 
line 9116=>except a few oddments. I  hope he will be happy,  when he gets used to being 
line 9117=>on his own. It's time he was his own master now.' 
line 9118=>     'Everything?' said Gandalf. 'The ring  as well? You agreed to that, you  
line 9119=>remember.' 
line 9120=>     'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,' stammered Bilbo.  
line 9121=>     'Where is it?' 
line 9122=>     'In an envelope, if you must know,'  said Bilbo impatiently. 'There  on 
line 9123=>the mantelpiece. Well,  no! Here it is in  my  pocket!' He hesitated.  'Isn't 
line 9124=>that odd now?'  he  said  softly  to himself. 'Yet after all,  why  not? Why 
line 9125=>shouldn't it stay there?' 
line 9126=>     Gandalf looked again very hard  at  Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his 
line 9127=>eyes.  'I think, Bilbo,' he said  quietly, 'I should leave  it behind. Don't  
line 9128=>you want to?' 
line 9129=>     'Well yes  - and no. Now it comes to it, I don't like parting with it at 
line 9130=>all, I may say. And I don't really see why I should. Why do you want me to?' 
line 9131=>he asked, and a  curious  change came  over  his voice.  It  was sharp  with 
line 9132=>
line 9133=>####-suspicion and annoyance. 'You are always badgering me about my ring; but 
line 9134=>you 
line 9135=>have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.' 
line 9136=>     'No, but I had to  badger  you,'  said Gandalf. 'I wanted the truth. It 
line 9137=>was  important. Magic  rings  are  - well, magical; and  they are  rare  and 
line 9138=>curious. I was  professionally interested in  your ring, you may say;  and I 
line 9139=>still am. I should like to know where it is, if you go wandering again. Also 
line 9140=>I  think you  have had  it quite long  enough. You won't need it  any  more. 
line 9141=>Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.' 
line 9142=>     Bilbo  flushed, and there  was an angry light in  his eyes.  His kindly 
line 9143=>face  grew hard. 'Why  not?'  he  cried. 'And what business is it of  yours, 
line 9144=>anyway, to know what I  do with my own things? It is my own. I found  it. It  
line 9145=>came to me.' 
line 9146=>     'Yes, yes,' said Gandalf. 'But there is no need to get angry.' 
line 9147=>     'If I am  it  is your  fault,' said Bilbo. 'It is mine, I  tell you. My 
line 9148=>own. My precious. Yes, my precious.' 
line 9149=>     The wizard's face remained grave and attentive,  and  only a flicker in 
line 9150=>his deep eyes showed that he  was startled and indeed  alarmed. 'It has been 
line 9151=>called that before,' he said,  'but not by you.' 
line 9152=>     'But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It's 
line 9153=>not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.' 
line 9154=>     Gandalf stood  up. He  spoke  sternly. 'You will be  a fool if  you do. 
line 9155=>Bilbo,' he said. 'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has  got 
line 9156=>far  too much  hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and  be 
line 9157=>free.' 
line 9158=>     'I'll do as I choose and go as I please,' said Bilbo obstinately. 
line 9159=>     'Now, now, my dear hobbit!  ' said Gandalf. 'All your long life we have 
line 9160=>been  friends, and you owe me something. Come!  Do as you promised: give  it 
line 9161=>up!  ' 
line 9162=>     'Well,  if  you  want my ring yourself, say  so!' cried Bilbo. 'But you  
line 9163=>won't get it.  I won't give my precious away, I tell  you.' His hand strayed 
line 9164=>to the hilt of his small sword. 
line 9165=>     Gandalf's eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,' he said. 
line 9166=>If  you  say  that again,  I shall.  Then  you  will  see Gandalf  the  Grey 
line 9167=>uncloaked.'  He took a step towards the hobbit,  and he seemed to  grow tall 
line 9168=>and menacing; his shadow filled the little room. 
line 9169=>     Bilbo backed away  to the  wall, brea thing hard, his hand  clutching at 
line 9170=>
line 9171=>####-his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another,  and the  air of  the 
line 9172=>room tingled. Gandalf's  eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly  his hands 
line 9173=>relaxed, and he began to tremble. 
line 9174=>     'I  don't know  what has  come  over  you, Gandalf,' he said. 'You have 
line 9175=>never been like this  before. What is it all  about? It is mine isn't it?  I 
line 9176=>found it, and Gollum would  have killed  me, if I hadn't kept it. I'm not  a  
line 9177=>thief, whatever he said.' 
line 9178=>     'I have  never called  you  one,' Gandalf answered. 'And  I  am not one 
line 9179=>either. I am not trying to rob you,  but to help you. I wish you would trust  
line 9180=>me,  as  you  used.' He turned  away, and the  shadow  passed. He  seemed to 
line 9181=>dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled. 
line 9182=>     Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,' he said. 'But I felt so 
line 9183=>queer.  And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any 
line 9184=>more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was 
line 9185=>like an eye  looking at me.  And  I  am  always  wanting  to put it  on  and 
line 9186=>disappear, don't you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to 
line 9187=>make sure. I tried locking it up, but  I found I couldn't rest without it in 
line 9188=>my pocket. I don't know why. And I don't seem able to make up my mind.' 
line 9189=>     'Then  trust mine,'  said Gandalf. 'It is quite  made  up.  Go away and 
line 9190=>leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo, and I will look after  
line 9191=>him.' 
line 9192=>     Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. 'All 
line 9193=>right,' he said with an effort. I will.' Then he shrugged his shoulders, and 
line 9194=>smiled rather ruefully. 'After  all that's what this party business  was all 
line 9195=>about, really: to  give away lots of birthday presents,  and somehow make it  
line 9196=>easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn't made it any easier in the 
line 9197=>end, but it would be  a pity  to waste  all my  preparations. It would quite 
line 9198=>spoil the joke.' 
line 9199=>     'Indeed  it would take  away the only point I ever saw in the  affair,' 
line 9200=>said Gandalf. 
line 9201=>     'Very well,' said Bilbo, 'it goes to Frodo  with all the rest.' He drew 
line 9202=>a  deep breath. 'And  now I  really must be starting, or somebody else  will 
line 9203=>catch  me.  I  have  said good-bye, and I couldn't bear  to  do it  all over  
line 9204=>again.' He picked up his bag and moved to the  door. 
line 9205=>     'You  have  still got the ring in your pocket,' said the wizard. 'Well, 
line 9206=>so I have!' cried Bilbo. 'And my will and  all  the other documents too. You  
line 9207=>had better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.' 
line 9208=>
line 9209=>####-     'No,  don't give  the  ring  to  me,'  said  Gandalf. 'Put  it  on  the 
line 9210=>mantelpiece. It will be safe enough  there, till Frodo comes.  I  shall wait 
line 9211=>for him.' 
line 9212=>     Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as  he was about to set it by the 
line 9213=>clock, his hand jerked back, and the  packet fell  on  the floor.  Before he 
line 9214=>could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and  set it in its place. 
line 9215=>A spasm  of anger passed swiftly over  the hobbit's  face again. Suddenly it 
line 9216=>gave way to a look of relief and a laugh. 'Well, that's that,' he said.  'Now 
line 9217=>I'm off!' 
line 9218=>     They went out into the hall.  Bilbo chose  his favourite stick from the 
line 9219=>stand; then he  whistled.  Three  dwarves came out of  different rooms where 
line 9220=>they had been busy. 
line 9221=>     'Is everything ready?' asked Bilbo. 'Everything packed and la belled?' 
line 9222=>     'Everything,' they answered. 
line 9223=>     'Well, let's start then!' He stepped out of the front-door. 
line 9224=>     It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked 
line 9225=>up,  sniffing  the air. 'What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the  Road 
line 9226=>with dwarves!  This  is  what  I  have  really  been longing for, for years! 
line 9227=>Good-bye!  ' he said, looking  at  his old  home and  bowing  to  the  door. 
line 9228=>'Good-bye, Gandalf!' 
line 9229=>     'Good-bye, for the present,  Bilbo. Take  care of yourself! You are old 
line 9230=>enough, and perhaps wise enough.' 
line 9231=>     'Take care! I  don't care. Don't  you worry about me! I am as happy now 
line 9232=>as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. 
line 9233=>I am being swept off my feet at last,' he added, and then in a low voice, as 
line 9234=>if to himself, he sang softly in the dark: 
line 9235=>     The Road goes ever on and on  
line 9236=>     Down from the door where it began. 
line 9237=>     Now far ahead the Road has gone, 
line 9238=>     And I must follow, if I can, 
line 9239=>     Pursuing it with eager feet, 
line 9240=>     Until it joins some larger way 
line 9241=>     Where many paths and errands meet. 
line 9242=>     And whither then? I cannot say. 
line 9243=>     He  paused, silent for a moment.  Then without another  word he  turned 
line 9244=>away from the lights and voices in the fields and tents, and followed by his 
line 9245=>three  companions  went round  into  his garden,  and trotted  down the long  
line 9246=>
line 9247=>####-sloping path. He  jumped over  a low place in the hedge  at the bottom,  and  
line 9248=>took to the meadows, passing into the night like a  rustle  of wind  in  the 
line 9249=>grass. 
line 9250=>     Gandalf  remained for a  while  staring  after  him  into the darkness. 
line 9251=>'Goodbye,  my dear Bilbo  - until our next meeting!' he said softly and went 
line 9252=>back indoors. 
line 9253=>     Frodo came  in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep 
line 9254=>in thought. 'Has he gone?' he asked. 
line 9255=>     'Yes,' answered Gandalf, 'he has gone at last.' 
line 9256=>     ' I wish - I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,' 
line 9257=>said Frodo. 'But I knew in my heart  that he  really  meant to go. He always 
line 9258=>used to  joke about serious things. I  wish  I had come back sooner, just to 
line 9259=>see him off.' 
line 9260=>     I  think really  he preferred slipping off quietly  in the  end,'  said 
line 9261=>Gandalf. 'Don't be too troubled. He'll be all right -  now. He left a packet 
line 9262=>for you. There it is!' 
line 9263=>     Frodo  took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and  glanced  at it, but 
line 9264=>did not open it. 
line 9265=>     'You'll find  his  will and all the other documents in there, I think,' 
line 9266=>said  the  wizard.  'You  are  the master of Bag End now. And also, I fancy, 
line 9267=>you'll find a golden ring.' 
line 9268=>     'The ring!' exclaimed Frodo. 'Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, 
line 9269=>it may be useful.' 
line 9270=>     'It may, and it  may  not,' said Gandalf. 'I should not make use of it, 
line 9271=>if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.' 
line 9272=>     As master of Bag End Frodo felt  it his painful duty to say good-bye to 
line 9273=>the guests. Rumours of strange events had by  now spread all over the field,  
line 9274=>but  Frodo would  only say  no doubt everything will be  cleared  up  in the 
line 9275=>morning.  About  midnight carriages  came for the important folk. One by one 
line 9276=>they rolled away, filled with full but  very  unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners 
line 9277=>came   by  arrangement,   and  removed  in  wheel-barrows  those   that  had 
line 9278=>inadvertently remained behind. 
line 9279=>     Night slowly  passed.  The  sun  rose. The  hobbits rose  rather later. 
line 9280=>Morning  went  on.  People  came  and began (by  orders) to  clear away  the 
line 9281=>pavilions  and the  tables  and the chairs,  and the  spoons and  knives and 
line 9282=>bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the flowering shrubs in boxes, and 
line 9283=>the  crumbs  and   cracker -paper,  the  forgotten   bags  and   gloves   and 
line 9284=>
line 9285=>####-handkerchiefs,  and  the uneaten food (a very small  item). Then a number of 
line 9286=>other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers, and 
line 9287=>Tooks, and other  guests that lived or  were staying near.  By mid-day, when 
line 9288=>even the best -fed were out and about again,  there  was a large crowd at Bag 
line 9289=>End, uninvited but not unexpected. 
line 9290=>     Frodo  was waiting on the step, smiling, but  looking rather  tired and 
line 9291=>worried. He welcomed all  the callers,  but he had not much more to say than 
line 9292=>before. His reply to all inquiries  was simply this: 'Mr. Bilbo  Baggins has 
line 9293=>gone away; as far as I know, for good.'  Some of  the visitors he invited to 
line 9294=>come inside, as Bilbo had left 'messages' for them. 
line 9295=>     Inside in the  hall there  was piled a large assortment of packages and 
line 9296=>parcels and small articles  of furniture.  On  every item there was  a label 
line 9297=>tied. There were several labels of this sort: 
line 9298=>     For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo, on an umbrella. 
line 9299=>Adelard 
line 9300=>had carried off many unlabelled ones. 
line 9301=>     For  DORA BAGGINS in  memory  of  a LONG correspondence, with love 
line 9302=>from 
line 9303=>Bilbo, on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo's sister and the eldest  
line 9304=>surviving female  relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she was ninety-nine,  and had 
line 9305=>written reams of good advice for more than half a century. 
line 9306=>     For  MILO BURROWS,  hoping it will be  useful, from B.B., on a gold pen 
line 9307=>and ink -bottle. Milo never answered letters.  
line 9308=>     For ANGELICA'S use, from Uncle Bilbo, on a round convex mirror. She 
line 9309=>was 
line 9310=>a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely. 
line 9311=>     For  the  collection  of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE,  from a  contributor,  on an 
line 9312=>(empty) book -case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than  usual 
line 9313=>at returning them. 
line 9314=>     For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS,  as  a PRESENT,  on  a  case  of  
line 9315=>silver 
line 9316=>spoons. Bilbo  believed that  she had  acquired a good  many of  his spoons,  
line 9317=>while he was away  on his former journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When 
line 9318=>she arrived later in the day, she took the point  at once, but she also took  
line 9319=>the spoons.  
line 9320=>     This  is  only  a  small  selection of  the assembled presents. Bilbo's 
line 9321=>residence had got rather cluttered up  with things in the course of his long 
line 9322=>
line 9323=>####-life.  It was a  tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the 
line 9324=>custom of giving so many birthday-presents was largely responsible.  Not, of 
line 9325=>course,  that the  birthday-presents  were always new,  there were one or two 
line 9326=>old mathoms  of forgotten uses that had circulated all around  the district; 
line 9327=>but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and  kept  those that he received. 
line 9328=>The old hole was now being cleared a little. 
line 9329=>     Every  one  of  the various  parting  gifts  had  labels,  written  out 
line 9330=>personally  by Bilbo,  and several had some point,  or  some  joke.  But, of 
line 9331=>course,  most  of the  things were  given where  they  would  be  wanted and 
line 9332=>welcome. The  poorer hobbits, and especially  those of Bagshot Row, did very 
line 9333=>well. Old Gaffer  Gamgee got  two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a  woollen 
line 9334=>waistcoat,  and  a   bottle  of  ointment  for  creaking  joints.  Old  Rory 
line 9335=>Brandybuck,  in  return  for  much  hospitality, got a dozen  bottles of Old 
line 9336=>Winyards: a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as 
line 9337=>it had been laid down by Bilbo's father. Rory quite forgave Bilbo, and voted 
line 9338=>him a capital fellow after the first bottle. 
line 9339=>     There was plenty of everything left for Frodo.  And, of course, all the 
line 9340=>chief  treasures, as well  as  the  books,  pictures, and  more than  enough 
line 9341=>furniture,  were  left  in his possession. There was,  however, no sign  nor  
line 9342=>mention of money or jewellery: not a  penny-piece or  a glass bead was given 
line 9343=>away. 
line 9344=>     Frodo had a  very  trying time that afternoon. A fa lse rumour  that the 
line 9345=>whole household was being distributed free spread like wildfire; and  before 
line 9346=>long  the place was packed with  people who had no business there, but could 
line 9347=>not be kept out. Labels got torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some  
line 9348=>people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make off 
line 9349=>with minor  items not  addressed to  them,  or  with  anything  that  seemed 
line 9350=>unwanted  or unwatched.  The road to the gate  was blocked  with barrows and 
line 9351=>handcarts.  
line 9352=>     In the middle of  the  commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo  
line 9353=>had retired for a while and left his  friend Merry Brandybuck to keep an eye 
line 9354=>on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.  
line 9355=>     'He is indisposed,' he said. 'He is resting.' 
line 9356=>     'Hiding, you mean,'  said  Lobelia. 'Anyway we want  to see him and  we 
line 9357=>mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!' 
line 9358=>     Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover  
line 9359=>their parting gift  of spoons. It did  not improve their tempers. Eventually 
line 9360=>
line 9361=>####-they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a  table with a lot  of 
line 9362=>papers in front of him. He looked indisposed - to see Sackville-Bagginses at 
line 9363=>any  rate;  and he stood up,  fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he 
line 9364=>spoke quite politely. 
line 9365=>     The Sackville-Bagginses were  rather offensive. They began  by offering 
line 9366=>him  bad  bargain-prices  (as between  friends)  for  various  valuable  and 
line 9367=>unlabelled  things.  When  Frodo  replied  that  only  the  things specially 
line 9368=>directed by Bilbo were being given away, they said the whole affair was very 
line 9369=>fishy. 
line 9370=>     'Only one thing  is clear to me,' said Otho, 'and that  is that you are 
line 9371=>doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.' 
line 9372=>     Otho would  have been Bilbo's heir, but for  the  adoption of Frodo. He 
line 9373=>read the will carefully and  snorted. It was,  unfortunately, very clear and 
line 9374=>correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other  
line 9375=>things seven signatures of witnesses in red ink). 
line 9376=>     'Foiled again!' he said  to his  wife. 'And after waiting sixty   years.  
line 9377=>Spoons? Fiddlesticks!' He snapped his fingers under Frodo's nose and slumped 
line 9378=>off. But Lobelia was not so easily got rid of. A little later Frodo came out 
line 9379=>of the study  to see how things were going  on and found her still about the 
line 9380=>place, investigating nooks  and comers and  tapping the  floors. He escorted 
line 9381=>her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but 
line 9382=>rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside  her umbrella.  Her  
line 9383=>face looked as if  she was in the throes of thinking out a  really  crushing 
line 9384=>parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:  
line 9385=>     'You'll live to regret  it, young  fellow! Why  didn't you  go too? You  
line 9386=>don't belong here; you're no Baggins  - you - you're a Brandybuck!' 
line 9387=>     'Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,' said Frodo 
line 9388=>as he shut the door on her. 
line 9389=>     'It was a compliment,' said Merry  Brandybuck, 'and so, of  course, not 
line 9390=>true.' 
line 9391=>     Then they went  round the hole,  and  evicted three  young hobbits (two 
line 9392=>Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking  holes  in the  walls  of one of the 
line 9393=>cellars.  Frodo  also had a  tussle  with young Sancho  Proudfoot  (old  Odo 
line 9394=>Proudfoot's  grandson),  who had  begun an  excavation in the larger pantry, 
line 9395=>where  he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo's gold excited both 
line 9396=>curiosity  and  hope;  for legendary  gold  (mysteriously obtained,  if  not  
line 9397=>positively ill-gotten), is, as every  one  knows, any one's for  the  finding 
line 9398=>
line 9399=>####--unless the search is interrupted. 
line 9400=>     When he had overcome  Sancho and  pushed him out, Frodo  collapsed on a  
line 9401=>chair in the hall. It's time to  close the shop, Merry,'  he said. 'Lock the 
line 9402=>door, and don't open it to anyone today,  not even if they bring a battering 
line 9403=>ram.' Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea. 
line 9404=>     He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. 
line 9405=>'Lobelia again most likely,' he thought. 'She must have thought of something 
line 9406=>really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.' 
line 9407=>     He went on  with his tea.  The knock was repeated,  much louder, but he 
line 9408=>took no notice. Suddenly the wizard's head appeared at the window.  
line 9409=>     'If you don't let me in, Frodo, I  shall blow your door right down your 
line 9410=>hole and out through the hill,' he said. 
line 9411=>     'My dear Gandalf! Half a  minute!' cried Frodo, running out of the room 
line 9412=>to the door. 'Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.' 
line 9413=>     'Then I  forgive you.  But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap 
line 9414=>towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk.' 
line 9415=>     'She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo's 
line 9416=>ring. I longed to disappear.' 
line 9417=>     'Don't do that!'  said  Gandalf, sitting down. 'Do be  careful of  that 
line 9418=>ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last 
line 9419=>word.' 
line 9420=>     'Well, what about it?' 
line 9421=>     'What do you know already?' 
line 9422=>     'Only  what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and 
line 9423=>how he used it: on his journey, I mean.' 
line 9424=>     'Which story, I wonder,' said Gandalf.  
line 9425=>     'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,' said Frodo. 'He 
line 9426=>told me  the  true story  soon after I  came to live here.  He said  you had 
line 9427=>pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. "No secrets between 
line 9428=>us,  Frodo,"  he  said;  "but  they are not  to go  any  further. It's  mine 
line 9429=>anyway."' 
line 9430=>     'That's interesting,' said Gandalf.  'Well,  what did  you  think of it 
line 9431=>all?' 
line 9432=>     'If you mean, inventing all that about a "present",  well, I thought the 
line 9433=>true story much more likely, and I  couldn't see the point of altering it at 
line 9434=>all. It was very  unlike Bilbo to do  so,  anyway; and I thought  it  rather  
line 9435=>odd.' 
line 9436=>
line 9437=>####-     'So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures 
line 9438=>- if  they use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful  with it. 
line 9439=>It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.' 
line 9440=>     'I don't understand,' said Frodo. 
line 9441=>     'Neither do I,'  answered  the wizard. 'I have  merely begun  to wonder  
line 9442=>about the ring,  especially since last night. No need to worry.  But if  you  
line 9443=>take my  advice you will use it very  seldom, or not at  all. At least I beg 
line 9444=>you not  to use it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say 
line 9445=>again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!' 
line 9446=>     'You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?' 
line 9447=>     'I am not certain, so I  will say no  more. I may  be able to  tell you  
line 9448=>something  when I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for 
line 9449=>the present.' He got up. 
line 9450=>     'At  once!' cried Frodo.  'Why,  I thought  you were staying  on for at 
line 9451=>least a week. I was looking forward to your help.' 
line 9452=>     'I did mean to  - but I have had to change my mind. I  may be away for a  
line 9453=>good while;  but  I'll come and see you again, as soon  as I  can. Expect me 
line 9454=>when you see me! I shall  slip in quietly.  I  shan't often be visiting  the 
line 9455=>Shire openly again.  I find that I have become rather unpopular. They  say I 
line 9456=>am a  nuisance  and  a  disturber  of the  peace. Some people  are  actually 
line 9457=>accusing me of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is 
line 9458=>supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his wealth.' 
line 9459=>     'Some  people!'  exclaimed Frodo.  'You  mean  Otho  and  Lobelia.  How 
line 9460=>abominable!  I would give  them Bag  End and everything else, if I could get  
line 9461=>Bilbo back  and go off tramping in the country with  him. I  love the Shire. 
line 9462=>But I begin to  wish, somehow, that I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever  
line 9463=>see him again.' 
line 9464=>     'So do I,' said Gandalf. 'And  I wonder many other things. Good-bye now!  
line 9465=>Take  care  of  yourself!  Look out  for  me, especially at  unlikely times!  
line 9466=>Good-bye!' 
line 9467=>     Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked 
line 9468=>off at a surprising pace; but Frodo  thought the  old wizard looked unusually 
line 9469=>bent, almost  as if  he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing 
line 9470=>in, and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not 
line 9471=>see him again for a long time. 
line 9472=> 
line 9473=> 
line 9474=>
line 9475=>####-<h4>Chapter 2.</h4> <br> The Shadow of the Past 
line 9476=>
line 9477=> 
line 9478=> 
line 9479=>     The talk did not die down in nine  or even ninety-nine days. The second 
line 9480=>disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all 
line 9481=>over the Shire,  for a year  and a day,  and was remembered much longer than 
line 9482=>that.  It became  a fireside -story for  young  hobbits;  and eventually  Mad 
line 9483=>Baggins,  who used to vanish with a  bang and a flash and reappear with bags 
line 9484=>of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long  
line 9485=>after all the true events were forgotten. 
line 9486=>     But in the meantime, the general opinion in the  neighbourhood was that 
line 9487=>Bilbo, who  had always been rather cracked, had at  last gone quite mad, and  
line 9488=>had run off into the Blue. There he had  undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a  
line 9489=>river and  come to a tragic,  but  hardly an  untimely, end.  The blame  was 
line 9490=>mostly laid on Gandalf. 
line 9491=>     'If only that  dratted  wizard will leave young  Frodo  alone,  perhaps 
line 9492=>he'll  settle  down  and  grow some  hobbit-sense,'  they said. And  to  all 
line 9493=>appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the  
line 9494=>growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once  began to  
line 9495=>carry on Bilbo's reputation for oddity. He  refused to go into mourning; and 
line 9496=>the next  year  he gave a party  in  honour of  Bilbo's  hundred-and-twelfth 
line 9497=>birthday, which he  called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was  short  of the 
line 9498=>mark, for twenty guests were invited  and  there were several meals at which  
line 9499=>it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say. 
line 9500=>     Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving 
line 9501=>Bilbo's  Birthday Party year after year  until  they got used to it. He said 
line 9502=>that he did not think Bilbo  was dead. When  they asked: 'Where is he then?' 
line 9503=>he shrugged his shoulders. 
line 9504=>     He lived  alone, as Bilbo had done; but he  had  a  good  many friends, 
line 9505=>especially among  the younger hobbits  (mostly descendants  of the Old Took) 
line 9506=>who  had  as children been fond of  Bilbo  and often in and out of Bag  End.  
line 9507=>Folco Boffin and Fredegar  Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends 
line 9508=>were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin),  and Merry Brandybuck  (his real 
line 9509=>name was Meriadoc, but  that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping 
line 9510=>all 
line 9511=>over  the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the 
line 9512=>amazement of  sensible folk he was sometimes  seen far  from home walking in 
line 9513=>
line 9514=>####-the hills and woods under the starlight.  Merry and Pippin suspected that he 
line 9515=>visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done. 
line 9516=>     As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of 
line 9517=>good 'preservation':  outwardly he retained the appearance  of a  robust and 
line 9518=>energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. 'Some folk have all the luck,' they 
line 9519=>said;  but it was not until Frodo approached the  usually more  sober age of 
line 9520=>fifty that they began to think it queer. 
line 9521=>     Frodo himself, after the first shock, found  that being his  own master  
line 9522=>and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End  was rather  pleasant. For some  years he was 
line 9523=>quite  happy and did not  worry much about the  future. But half unknown  to 
line 9524=>himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was  steadily growing. He 
line 9525=>found himself  wondering at times,  especially in the autumn, about the wild 
line 9526=>lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his 
line 9527=>dreams. He began to sa y to himself: 'Perhaps I shall cross the  River myself 
line 9528=>one day.' To which the other half of his mind always replied: 'Not yet.' 
line 9529=>     So it  went on,  until his forties were  running  out, and his fiftieth 
line 9530=>birthday  was  drawing  near:  fifty  was a number   that he felt was somehow 
line 9531=>significant (or ominous); it was at any  rate at that age that adventure had 
line 9532=>suddenly  befallen  Bilbo. Frodo began to feel  restless, and the  old paths 
line 9533=>seemed too well-trodden. He  looked at maps, and  wondered  what lay  beyond 
line 9534=>their edges: maps made  in the Shire showed  mostly  white spaces beyond its 
line 9535=>borders.  He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and 
line 9536=>Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking 
line 9537=>and talking with the strange  wayfarers that began at this time to appear in 
line 9538=>the Shire. 
line 9539=>     There were rumours of  strange things happening in the  world  outside; 
line 9540=>and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several 
line 9541=>years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the 
line 9542=>Shire, could  now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, 
line 9543=>passing and  not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and  were  no  
line 9544=>longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road 
line 9545=>in  unusual numbers. The ancient East -West Road ran through the Shire to its 
line 9546=>end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their 
line 9547=>mines in the Blue Mountains. They  were the  hobbits' chief  source of  news 
line 9548=>from distant parts  - if they  wanted any: as a rule  dwarves said little and 
line 9549=>hobbits  asked  no  more.  But now Frodo  often met strange dwarves  of  far  
line 9550=>countries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in 
line 9551=>
line 9552=>####-whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor. 
line 9553=>     That name  the hobbits  only knew in legends  of the  dark past, like a  
line 9554=>shadow  in  the  background  of their  memories;  but  it  was  ominous  and 
line 9555=>disquieting. It seemed that the  evil power in Mirkwood had been  driven out 
line 9556=>by the White Council  only  to  reappear  in  greater  strength  in the  old 
line 9557=>strongholds of Mordor. The  Dark Tower had been rebuilt,  it was  said. From 
line 9558=>there the  power was spreading far and  wide,  and away far  east  and south 
line 9559=>there were  wars and  growing  fear.  Orcs were  multiplying  again  in  the  
line 9560=>mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but  cunning and armed 
line 9561=>with  dreadful  weapons.  And there  were  murmured  hints of creatures more 
line 9562=>terrible than all these, but they had no name. 
line 9563=>     Little of all this,  of  course, reached the ears of  ordinary hobbits. 
line 9564=>But  even the deafest  and most stay-at-home began to hear queer  tales; and 
line 9565=>those whose business  took  them  to  the  borders  saw strange  things. The 
line 9566=>conversation in The  Green Dragon at Bywater,  one evening in the spring  of 
line 9567=>Frodo's  fiftieth year,  showed that  even in the comfortable  heart of  the 
line 9568=>Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them. 
line 9569=>     Sam Gamgee was sitting in one  corner near the fire,  and opposite  him 
line 9570=>was Ted  Sandyman, the  miller's son;  and there  were various  other rustic 
line 9571=>hobbits listening to their talk. 
line 9572=>     'Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,' said Sam. 
line 9573=>     'Ah,'  said  Ted, 'you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales 
line 9574=>and children's stories at home, if I want to.' 
line 9575=>     'No doubt you can,' retorted Sam, 'and I daresay  there's more truth in 
line 9576=>some of them than you reckon.  Who invented the stories anyway? Take 
line 9577=>dragons 
line 9578=>now.' 
line 9579=>     'No thank 'ee,' said  Ted, 'I won't.  I heard tell of them when I was a  
line 9580=>youngster, but there's no  call to  believe in  them  now. There's  only one 
line 9581=>Dragon in Bywater, and that's Green,' he said, getting a general laugh. 
line 9582=>     'All  right,' said  Sam, laughing with the rest. 'But  what about these 
line 9583=>Tree-men, these giants, as you might call  them? They do say that one bigger 
line 9584=>than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.' 
line 9585=>     'Who's they?' 
line 9586=>     'My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up 
line 9587=>to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He saw one.' 
line 9588=>     'Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal's always saying  he's seen  things; and 
line 9589=>
line 9590=>####-maybe he sees things that ain't there.' 
line 9591=>     'But  this  one was as big  as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven 
line 9592=>yards to a stride, if it was an inch.' 
line 9593=>     'Then I bet it wasn't an inch. What he saw was an elm  tree, as like as 
line 9594=>not.' 
line 9595=>     'But this one was  walking, I tell you; and there  ain't no elm tree on 
line 9596=>the North Moors.' 
line 9597=>     'Then Hal can't have  seen one,' said Ted. There  was some laughing and 
line 9598=>clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had scored a point. 
line 9599=>     'All  the same,'  said  Sam,  'you can't deny  that others besides  our 
line 9600=>Halfast have seen  queer  folk crossing the  Shire  - crossing  it, mind you: 
line 9601=>there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders  have never  
line 9602=>been so busy before. 
line 9603=>     'And I've heard tell  that Elves are moving west. They do  say they are 
line 9604=>going to the harbours, out away beyond the  White Towers.' Sam waved his 
line 9605=>arm 
line 9606=>vaguely: neither he nor  any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the 
line 9607=>old towers  beyond  the western borders  of the  Shire. But  it was  an  old 
line 9608=>tradition that  away over  there stood the Grey  Havens, from which at times 
line 9609=>elven-ships set sail, never to return. 
line 9610=>     'They are sailing,  sailing, sailing over the Sea,  they are going into 
line 9611=>the West  and  leaving us,' said  Sam, half chanting the words, shaking  his 
line 9612=>head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed. 
line 9613=>     'Well,  that isn't anything  new, if you believe the  old tales.   And I 
line 9614=>don't see  what it matters to me or you.  Let  them sail!  But I warrant you  
line 9615=>haven't seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire.' 
line 9616=>     'Well I don't  know,' said Sam  thoughtfully. He believed he  had  once 
line 9617=>seen an Elf in the  woods, and still hoped to  see more one  day. Of all the 
line 9618=>legends  that he had heard in his  early  years such fragments of tales  and 
line 9619=>half-remembered  stories  about  the Elves as the hobbits knew,  had  always 
line 9620=>moved him  most deeply. 'There  are some,  even in these parts, as  know the 
line 9621=>Fair Folk and get news  of them,'  he said. 'There's Mr. Baggins now, that I 
line 9622=>work for. He told me  that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves.  
line 9623=>And old Mr. Bilbo knew more:  many's the  talk I had with  him  when I was a  
line 9624=>little lad.' 
line 9625=>     'Oh, they're both cracked,' said Ted. 'Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, 
line 9626=>and Frodo's cracking. If that's where  you get your news from, you'll  never  
line 9627=>
line 9628=>####-want for moonshine. Well,  friends,  I'm  off home.  Your  good  health!' He 
line 9629=>drained his mug and  went out noisily. 
line 9630=>     Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For  
line 9631=>one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have 
line 9632=>a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But 
line 9633=>Sam ha d more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up 
line 9634=>and went out. 
line 9635=>     It was  early April and the sky was now clearing after  heavy rain. The 
line 9636=>sun was down,  and  a cool  pale evening was quietly fading  into night.  He 
line 9637=>walked  home  under  the  early stars  through  Hobbiton and  up  the  Hill, 
line 9638=>whistling softly and thoughtfully. 
line 9639=>     It  was  just at  this  time that  Gandalf  reappeared  after his  long 
line 9640=>absence. For three years  after  the Party he had  been away.  Then he  paid 
line 9641=>Frodo a  brief visit,  and after taking a good look at him he went off again. 
line 9642=>During  the  next  year  or  two  he  had  turned  up  fairly often,  coming 
line 9643=>unexpectedly  after  dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise.  He 
line 9644=>would  not  discuss  his  own  business  and  journeys, and  seemed  chiefly 
line 9645=>interested in small news about Frodo's health and doings. 
line 9646=>     Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo 
line 9647=>had seen or heard of him, and  he had begun  to think that  the wizard would 
line 9648=>never return and  had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as 
line 9649=>Sam was walking home  and twilight was fading, there came the once  familiar 
line 9650=>tap on the study window.  
line 9651=>     Frodo welcomed  his old friend with  surprise  and great delight.  They 
line 9652=>looked hard at one another. 
line 9653=>     'Ah well eh?' said Gandalf. 'You look the same as ever, Frodo!' 
line 9654=>     'So do you,' Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked 
line 9655=>older and  more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide 
line 9656=>world, and  soon they were  deep in talk, and  they stayed  up far into  the 
line 9657=>night. 
line 9658=>     Next morning after a late breakfast, the  wizard was sitting with Frodo 
line 9659=>by the open  window of the  study. A bright fire was on the hearth,  but the 
line 9660=>sun was warm, and  the  wind was in the  South. Everything looked fresh, and 
line 9661=>the new green of Spring  was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the  
line 9662=>trees' fingers.  
line 9663=>     Gandalf  was thinking of  a  spring,  nearly  eighty years before, when 
line 9664=>Bilbo  had run out  of Bag End without  a handkerchief. His hair was perhaps 
line 9665=>
line 9666=>####-whiter  than it  had  been  then,  and his  beard  and eyebrows were perhaps 
line 9667=>longer, and  his face more lined with care and  wisdom; but his eyes were as 
line 9668=>bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour  and 
line 9669=>delight. 
line 9670=>     He was  smoking  now in  silence, for  Frodo was sitting still, deep in 
line 9671=>thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark shadow of the tidings 
line 9672=>that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence. 
line 9673=>     'Last  night  you  began to  tell  me  strange  things  about  my ring, 
line 9674=>Gandalf,' he said. 'And then you stopped, because you said that such matters 
line 9675=>were best left until  daylight. Don't you think  you  had better finish now?  
line 9676=>You  say the ring  is dangerous,  far mor e  dangerous than  I guess. In what 
line 9677=>way?' 
line 9678=>     'In many  ways,' answered  the wizard. It is far  more powerful than  I 
line 9679=>ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the  end it  would utterly 
line 9680=>overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him. 
line 9681=>     'In Eregion long  ago many Elven-rings  were made,  magic  rings as you  
line 9682=>call them, and they were, of course, of various  kinds: some more potent and 
line 9683=>some  less.  The lesser rings were only essays  in the craft before  it  was 
line 9684=>full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but  trifles  - yet still to my 
line 9685=>mind dangerous for mortals. But  the Great Rings,  the Rings of Power,  they 
line 9686=>were perilous.  
line 9687=>     'A  mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great  Rings, does not die, but 
line 9688=>he does not  grow  or obtain more life, he merely continues, until  at  last 
line 9689=>every minute is a weariness. And if he often  uses the Ring  to make himself 
line 9690=>invisible,  he fades: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks 
line 9691=>in the twilight under the eye of the  dark power that rules the Rings.  Yes, 
line 9692=>sooner or  later  - later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but 
line 9693=>neither strength nor good purpose will last  - sooner or later the dark power  
line 9694=>will devour him.' 
line 9695=>     'How terrifying!' said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound 
line 9696=>of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden. 
line 9697=>     'How long have you  known this?'  asked Frodo  at length. 'And how much 
line 9698=>did Bilbo know?' 
line 9699=>     'Bilbo knew no  more than he told you, I  am  sure,' said Gandalf.  'He 
line 9700=>would certainly never have  passed on  to you anything that he thought would 
line 9701=>be a danger, even though I  promised to  look after you. He thought the ring  
line 9702=>was very beautiful, and very  useful at  need;  and if anything was wrong or 
line 9703=>
line 9704=>####-queer, it was himself. He said that it was "growing on his mind", and he was 
line 9705=>always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to 
line 9706=>blame.  Though he had found out that  the thing needed looking after; it did 
line 9707=>not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded  in an odd 
line 9708=>way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight.' 
line 9709=>     'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,' said Frodo,  'so I have 
line 9710=>always kept it on its chain.' 
line 9711=>     'Very wise,'  said Gandalf.  'But  as for  his long life,   Bilbo  never  
line 9712=>connected  it  with the  ring  at all. He took  all  the credit  for that to 
line 9713=>himself,  and he was very  proud of  it. Though  he was getting restless and 
line 9714=>uneasy.  Thin and  stretched  he  said. A  sign  that  the  ring was getting 
line 9715=>control.' 
line 9716=>     'How long have you known all this?' asked Frodo again. 
line 9717=>     'Known?'  said  Gandalf.  'I  have known  much that only the Wise know,  
line 9718=>Frodo. But  if you mean "known about this ring", well,  I still do not know,  
line 9719=>one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.  
line 9720=>     'When did I first begin to guess?' he mused, searching back  in memory. 
line 9721=>'Let me see - it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power  
line 9722=>from Mirkwood,  just before the Battle of Five  Armies, that Bilbo found his 
line 9723=>ring.  A  shadow  fell on my  heart then, though  I did not know  yet what I 
line 9724=>feared. I wondered often how Gollum came  by a Great Ring, as plainly it was 
line 9725=>- that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo's strange story 
line 9726=>of how he had "won" it, and I  could not believe it. When I at last  got the 
line 9727=>truth out of him,  I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to 
line 9728=>the  ring beyond  doubt. Much like Gollum  with his "birthday  present". The 
line 9729=>lies were too much alike for my comfort.  Clearly the ring had an unwholesome 
line 9730=>power  that  set to  work on  its keeper at once.  That was the  first  real 
line 9731=>warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were 
line 9732=>better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little 
line 9733=>else that I could  do.  I could not take it  from him without doing  greater  
line 9734=>harm; and  I had no right to  do so anyway. I could only watch  and wait.  I 
line 9735=>might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held 
line 9736=>me 
line 9737=>back.' 
line 9738=>     'Who is he?' asked Frodo. I have never heard of him before.' 
line 9739=>     'Maybe  not,' answered Gandalf. 'Hobbits  are, or were,  no concern  of 
line 9740=>his. Yet he is great among the Wise.  He  is the  chief of  my order and the 
line 9741=>
line 9742=>####-head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it,  
line 9743=>and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, 
line 9744=>is  his province. He  has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their 
line 9745=>making; but when the  Rings  were debated  in the Council, all that he would  
line 9746=>reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept  - but 
line 9747=>uneasily. Still I watched and I waited. 
line 9748=>     'And all  seemed well  with  Bilbo. And  the  years  passed. Yes,  they 
line 9749=>passed, and  they seemed  not to touch him.  He showed no signs of age.  The 
line 9750=>shadow fell  on me  again. But I said  to  myself: "After all he comes of  a  
line 9751=>long-lived family on his mother's side. There is time yet. Wait!" 
line 9752=>     'And  I waited.  Until  that night when he left this house. He said and 
line 9753=>did things then that  filled me with a  fear that no words  of Saruman could 
line 9754=>allay. I knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have  
line 9755=>spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.' 
line 9756=>     'There  wasn't  any  permanent  harm  done,  was  there?'  asked  Frodo 
line 9757=>anxiously. 'He would  get all right in time, wouldn't he? Be able to rest in 
line 9758=>peace, I mean?' 
line 9759=>     'He felt better at once,' said Gandalf. 'But there is only one Power in 
line 9760=>this world that knows all about the Rings and their effects; and as far as I 
line 9761=>know there is no Power  in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the 
line 9762=>Wise I  am  the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch  of 
line 9763=>knowledge, but  full  of surprises.  Soft as  butter  they  can be,  and yet 
line 9764=>sometimes as tough as old  tree-roots.  I  think it likely  that  some would  
line 9765=>resist the  Rings far longer  than most of the Wise  would believe.  I don't 
line 9766=>think you need worry about Bilbo. 
line 9767=>     'Of  course, he possessed the ring  for many years,  and used it,  so it 
line 9768=>might take a long while for the  influence to  wear off  - before it was safe 
line 9769=>for him to see it  again, for  instance.  Otherwise,  he might  live on  for  
line 9770=>years,  quite happily: just stop  as  he was when he parted with  it. For he 
line 9771=>gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I  was  not 
line 9772=>troubled about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the  thing go. It is for  
line 9773=>you that I feel responsible. 
line 9774=>     'Ever  since  Bilbo left  I have been deeply concerned  about you,  and 
line 9775=>about all  these charming, absurd, helpless  hobbits. It would be a grievous 
line 9776=>blow to the world, if  the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all  your kind, 
line 9777=>jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers, Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not 
line 9778=>to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.' 
line 9779=>
line 9780=>####-     Frodo shuddered. 'But why  should we be?'  he asked. 'And why should he 
line 9781=>want such slaves?' 
line 9782=>     'To tell you the  truth,' replied Gandalf,  'I  believe that hitherto - 
line 9783=>hitherto,  mark you - he has entirely overlooked the existence  of   hobbits.  
line 9784=>You should be thankful. But your  safety has passed. He does not need you   - 
line 9785=>he  has  many  more useful  servants   -  but  he won't forget you again. And 
line 9786=>hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and 
line 9787=>free. There is  such a thing as malice and revenge.' 
line 9788=>     'Revenge?' said Frodo. 'Revenge for what? I still don't understand what 
line 9789=>all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our ring.' 
line 9790=>     'It has everything to do with  it,' said Gandalf. 'You do  not know the 
line 9791=>real peril  yet; but  you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I was last  
line 9792=>here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for a moment.' 
line 9793=>     Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain 
line 9794=>that hung  from  his  belt. He unfastened  it  and handed  it slowly  to the 
line 9795=>wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in 
line 9796=>some way reluctant for Gandalf to touch it. 
line 9797=>     Gandalf held it up. It looked  to be  made of pure and solid gold. 'Can 
line 9798=>you see any markings  on it?' he asked. 
line 9799=>     'No,'  said  Frodo. 'There  are none. It is quite  plain,  and it never  
line 9800=>shows a scratch or sign of wear.' 
line 9801=>     'Well  then, look!'  To Frodo's  astonishment and  distress  the wizard 
line 9802=>threw it suddenly  into the middle  of a glowing corner  of the fire.  Frodo 
line 9803=>gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back. 
line 9804=>     'Wait!' he said in a commanding voice,  giving Frodo a quick  look from 
line 9805=>under his bristling brows. 
line 9806=>     No apparent  change came over the ring. After a  while  Gandalf got up, 
line 9807=>closed  the shutters outside the window,  and drew  the  curtains.  The room 
line 9808=>became dark and silent, though the  clack of Sam's shears, now nearer to the  
line 9809=>windows,  could  still be heard  faintly from the garden. For  a  moment the 
line 9810=>wizard st ood looking at the fire; then he stooped and  removed  the ring  to 
line 9811=>the hearth with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped. 
line 9812=>     It  is quite cool,' said Gandalf. 'Take it!' Frodo received  it  on his 
line 9813=>shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever. 
line 9814=>     'Hold it up!' said Gandalf. 'And look closely!' 
line 9815=>     As  Frodo  did  so,  he  now  saw  fine  lines, finer than  the  finest  
line 9816=>pen-strokes,  running along the ring, outside and inside: lines of fire that 
line 9817=>
line 9818=>####-seemed  to  form  the  letters of a flowing  script. They  shone  piercingly 
line 9819=>bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth. 
line 9820=> 
line 9821=>     I cannot read the fiery letters,' said Frodo in a quavering voice. 
line 9822=>     'No,' said Gandalf, 'but I can. The  letters are Elvish,  of an ancient 
line 9823=>mode, but the  language is that of Mordor, which I will  not utter here. But 
line 9824=>this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough: 
line 9825=>     One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, 
line 9826=>     One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. 
line 9827=>     It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore: 
line 9828=>     Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky, 
line 9829=>     Seven for the Dwarf- lords in their halls of stone, 
line 9830=>     Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, 
line 9831=>     One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne 
line 9832=>     In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie. 
line 9833=>     One Ring to rule them all. One Ring to find them, 
line 9834=>     One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them 
line 9835=>     In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.' 
line 9836=>     He  paused,  and  then  said  slowly in  a  deep voice:  'This  is  the 
line 9837=>Master-ring, the One  Ring to rule them all.  This is the  One  Ring that he 
line 9838=>lost many ages ago, to the great weakening of  his power. He greatly desires 
line 9839=>it - but he must not get it.' 
line 9840=>     Frodo sat silent  and motionless.  Fear seemed  to stretch out  a  vast  
line 9841=>hand, like a dark  cloud rising in the East and  looming  up  to engulf him. 
line 9842=>'This ring!' he stammered. 'How, how on earth did it come to me?' 
line 9843=>     'Ah!' said Gandalf. 'That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back 
line 9844=>in  the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now remember. If  I were to 
line 9845=>tell  you all  that tale, we should still  be sitting  here when  Spring had 
line 9846=>passed into Winter. 
line 9847=>     'But last  night  I told  you of Sauron the Great,  the Dark  Lord. The 
line 9848=>rumours that you have  heard are  true: he  has indeed arisen again and left 
line 9849=>his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the  Dark Tower 
line 9850=>of Mordor. That name even  you  hobbits have heard of, like a  shadow on the 
line 9851=>borders of  old  stories. Always after a  defeat and a  respite, the  Shadow 
line 9852=>takes another shape and grows again.' 
line 9853=>     'I wish it need not have happened in my time,' said Frodo. 
line 9854=>     'So do I,' said Gandalf, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But 
line 9855=>
line 9856=>####-that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the 
line 9857=>time that  is given, us. And already, Frodo,  our  time is beginning to look  
line 9858=>black. The Enemy is fast becoming very strong. His plans are  far from ripe,  
line 9859=>I think, but  they are ripening. We shall be hard put to  it.  We  should be 
line 9860=>very hard put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance. 
line 9861=>     'The Enemy  still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to 
line 9862=>beat down all resistance,  break the last defences, and cover  all the lands 
line 9863=>in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring. 
line 9864=>     'The  Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid  from him, and  his hand 
line 9865=>never touched  them or  sullied them. Seven the  Dwarf-kings possessed,  but 
line 9866=>three he  has recovered,  and the others the  dragons have consumed. Nine he 
line 9867=>gave  to  Mortal Men,  proud and great, and so ensnared them. Long ago  they 
line 9868=>fell under  the dominion  of the One, and they became  Ringwraiths,  shadows 
line 9869=>under  his  great Shadow, his most terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a  
line 9870=>year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who  knows?  As the Shadow grows 
line 9871=>once 
line 9872=>more, they too may walk again. But  come!  We will not speak of such  things 
line 9873=>even in the morning of the Shire. 
line 9874=>     'So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also,  or  
line 9875=>else  they are  destroyed.  The Three are hidden still.  But that no  longer  
line 9876=>troubles him. He only  needs the One; for he made  that Ring himself, it  is 
line 9877=>his, and he let a great part of his  own former power pass  into it, so that 
line 9878=>he could rule all the other s.  If he recovers it, then he  will command them 
line 9879=>all again, wherever they be,  even the Three, and  all that has been wrought 
line 9880=>with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger than ever. 
line 9881=>     'And this  is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the  One had 
line 9882=>perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should have been  done. But he 
line 9883=>knows now that it has not perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking 
line 9884=>it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent  on it. It is his great hope and 
line 9885=>our great fear. ' 
line 9886=>     'Why,  why wasn't it destroyed?'  cried Frodo. 'And how  did  the Enemy  
line 9887=>ever come to lose it, if  he  was so strong, and it was so precious to him?' 
line 9888=>He  clutched  the Ring  in his hand,  as  if  he saw  already  dark  fingers 
line 9889=>stretching out to seize it. 
line 9890=>     'It  was taken from him,' said Gandalf.  'The  strength of the Elves to 
line 9891=>resist  him was greater long ago; and  not all Men were estranged from them. 
line 9892=>The  Men of Westernesse  came  to their aid. That  is a  chapter of  ancient 
line 9893=>
line 9894=>####-history which it might be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and 
line 9895=>gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. 
line 9896=>One day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in 
line 9897=>full by one who knows it best. 
line 9898=>     'But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how  this thing 
line 9899=>came to  you, and that will be tale enough, this is all that  I will say. It 
line 9900=>was Gil-galad,  Elven-king and Elendil  of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, 
line 9901=>though they themselves perished in the  deed; and Isildur Elendil's son  cut 
line 9902=>the  Ring  from  Sauron's hand and  took  it  for his own.  Then  Sauron was 
line 9903=>vanquished  and  his  spirit fled and was hidden for long  years,  until his 
line 9904=>shadow took shape again in Mirkwood. 
line 9905=>     'But  the  Ring was  lost. It fell  into  the Great  River, Anduin,  and 
line 9906=>vanished. For Isildur was marching north  along the east banks of the River,  
line 9907=>and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs of the Mountains, and 
line 9908=>almost all his folk  were slain. He leaped  into the waters,  but  the  Ring 
line 9909=>slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Orcs saw him and killed him 
line 9910=>with arrows.' 
line 9911=>     Gandalf paused. 'And there in the dark pools amid the  Gladden Fields,' 
line 9912=>he said, 'the Ring passed out  of knowledge and legend; and even so much  of 
line 9913=>its history is known now  only to a few, and the Council of the  Wise  could 
line 9914=>discover no more. But at last I can carry on the story, I think. 
line 9915=>     'Long  after, but  still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the 
line 9916=>Great River  on  the edge of  Wilderland  a  clever -handed  and quiet-footed 
line 9917=>little people. I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of  the 
line 9918=>fathers  of the Stoors, for they loved  the  River, and often swam in it, or  
line 9919=>made  little  boats  of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute,  
line 9920=>for it was  large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother  
line 9921=>of  the  folk, stern  and  wise  in old lore,  such  as they  had. The  most 
line 9922=>inquisitive and  curious-minded of that  family was called  Smjagol. He  was 
line 9923=>interested in  roots and beginnings; he dived into  deep pools; he  burrowed 
line 9924=>under  trees and  growing plants; he tunnelled  into green  mounds;  and  he 
line 9925=>ceased to  look up at the hill -tops, or the leaves on trees, or  the flowers 
line 9926=>opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward. 
line 9927=>     'He had a  friend  called Djagol, of similar sort, sharper -eyed but not 
line 9928=>so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and went down to the Gladden 
line 9929=>Fields, where  there were  great beds  of  iris  and  flowering reeds. There 
line 9930=>Smjagol got out and went nosing about the banks but Deal sat in the boat and 
line 9931=>
line 9932=>####-fished. Suddenly a great fish took  his  hook, and before he  knew where  he 
line 9933=>was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to  the bottom. Then he let 
line 9934=>go of his line, for he thought he saw  something shining  in  the river -bed; 
line 9935=>and holding his breath he grabbed at it. 
line 9936=>     'Then up he came spluttering,  with weeds in his  hair and a handful of 
line 9937=>mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away, 
line 9938=>there 
line 9939=>in his  hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it  shone and glittered in the 
line 9940=>sun, so  that his heart  was glad.  But  Smjagol had  been watching him from 
line 9941=>behind  a tree, and as Deal  gloated  over the  ring, Smjagol came softly up 
line 9942=>behind. 
line 9943=>     '"Give  us  that,  Deal,  my  love,"  said Smjagol,  over  his friend's 
line 9944=>shoulder. 
line 9945=>     '"Why?" said Deal. 
line 9946=>     ' "Because it's my birthday, my love, and I wants it," said Smjagol. 
line 9947=>     '"I don't care," said Deal. "I have  given  you a present already, more 
line 9948=>than I could afford. I found this, and I'm going to keep it." 
line 9949=>     ' "Oh, are you  indeed, my  love," said  Smjagol; and he caught Deal by 
line 9950=>the  throat  and  strangled  him,  because  the gold  looked  so bright  and 
line 9951=>beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger. 
line 9952=>     'No one  ever found out what had become  of  Deal;  he was murdered far  
line 9953=>from home, and  his body  was cunningly hidden. But  Smjagol returned alone; 
line 9954=>and he found that none of his  family could see him, when he was wearing the 
line 9955=>ring. He was  very  pleased with  his discovery  and he concealed it; and he 
line 9956=>used it  to  find  out secrets, and  he  put  his  knowledge to crooked  and 
line 9957=>malicious  uses.  He became  sharp-eyed and  keen-eared  for  all  that  was 
line 9958=>hurtful. The ring had given him power according to  his stature. It is not to 
line 9959=>be wondered at  that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when 
line 9960=>visible)  
line 9961=>by  all his  relations.  They kicked him, and he  bit their feet. He took to 
line 9962=>thieving, and going about muttering to himself,  and gurgling in his throat. 
line 9963=>So they called him Gollum, and cursed him, and told him to go far  away; and 
line 9964=>his grandmother, desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him 
line 9965=>out of her hole. 
line 9966=>     'He wandered in  loneliness, weeping a little for the  hardness  of the 
line 9967=>world, and he journeyed up the River, till  he came to a stream that  flowed 
line 9968=>down from the mountains, and he went that way.  He caught fish in deep pools 
line 9969=>
line 9970=>####-with invisible fingers and ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as  he 
line 9971=>was  bending over a  pool, he felt a burning  on the back of his head) and a  
line 9972=>dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he 
line 9973=>had almost forgotten about  the Sun. Then for the last time he looked up and 
line 9974=>shook his fist at her. 
line 9975=>     'But  as  he  lowered his eyes, he saw far above  the tops of the Misty 
line 9976=>Mountains, out of which the stream came.  And he thought suddenly: "It would 
line 9977=>be cool and shady under  those mountains. The Sun could not  watch me there. 
line 9978=>The  roots  of those mountains  must be  roots indeed; there  must be  great 
line 9979=>secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning." 
line 9980=>     'So he journeyed by night up into  the highlands, and he found a little 
line 9981=>cave  out of which the dark stream ran; and  he wormed his way like a maggot 
line 9982=>into the heart of the  hills, and vanished  out  of all  knowledge. The Ring 
line 9983=>went into the shadows with him, and even the maker, when his power had 
line 9984=>begun 
line 9985=>to grow again, could learn nothing of it.' 
line 9986=>     'Gollum!' cried  Frodo. 'Gollum? Do  you mean  that this  is  the  very 
line 9987=>Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!' 
line 9988=>     'I  think  it  is  a sad  story,' said the  wizard, 'and it might  have 
line 9989=>happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.' 
line 9990=>     'I  can't  believe  that  Gollum  was  connected with  hobbits, however 
line 9991=>distantly,' said Frodo with some heat. 'What an abominable notion!' 
line 9992=>     'It is  true all  the same,' replied Gandalf. 'About their  origins, at 
line 9993=>any  rate, I know  more than hobbits  do themselves. And even  Bilbo's story 
line 9994=>suggests the kinship. There  was  a  great  deal in the background  of their 
line 9995=>minds  and memories  that was  very  similar.  They  understood one  another 
line 9996=>remarkably well,  very much  better  than a hobbit would  understand, say, a  
line 9997=>Dwarf, or an Orc, or even  an Elf. Think of the riddles they both  knew, for  
line 9998=>one thing.' 
line 9999=>     'Yes,' said Frodo. 'Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and 
line 10000=>of  much the same sort. And hobbits don't cheat.  Gollum  meant to cheat all  
line 10001=>the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo  off his  guard. And I daresay 
line 10002=>it amused his wickedness  to  start a game which might end  in providing him 
line 10003=>with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.' 
line 10004=>     'Only too true, I fear,' said Gandalf. 'But there was something else in 
line 10005=>it, I think, which you don't see yet. Even Gollum was not wholly  ruined. He 
line 10006=>had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed  -as a hobbit 
line 10007=>
line 10008=>####-might. There  was a little  corner of  his mind that was still  his own, and 
line 10009=>light  came  through it, as  through  a  chink in the dark: light out of the 
line 10010=>past.  It was actually  pleasant,  I think,  to  hear  a kindly voice again, 
line 10011=>bringing up memories  of wind,  and trees, and sun  on the  grass, and  such 
line 10012=>forgotten things.  
line 10013=>     'But that, of  course, would only make the evil  part of him angrier in 
line 10014=>the end - unless it could  be conquered.  Unless it could be cured.' Gandalf 
line 10015=>sighed. 'Alas! there is little hope of  that for him. Yet  not  no hope. No, 
line 10016=>not  though  he  possessed  the Ring so  long, almost  as far back as he can 
line 10017=>remember. For it was long since he  had worn it much:  in the black darkness 
line 10018=>it was seldom needed. Certainly he had never "faded".  He is  thin and tough 
line 10019=>still. But the  thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had 
line 10020=>become almost unbearable. 
line 10021=>     'All the "great secrets" under the mountains had turned  out to be just  
line 10022=>empty night: there was  nothing more to find out,  nothing worth doing, only 
line 10023=>nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering.  He was altogether wretched. 
line 10024=>He hated the  dark,  and  he hated light more: he hated  everything, and the 
line 10025=>Ring most of all.' 
line 10026=>     'What  do you mean?' said Frodo. 'Surely the Ring was his  precious and 
line 10027=>the only thing he cared for?  But if he  hated it,  why didn't he get rid of 
line 10028=>it, or go away and leave it?' 
line 10029=>     'You  ought to  begin to understand, Frodo,  after all you have heard,' 
line 10030=>said Gandalf. 'He  hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved  himself. He 
line 10031=>could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter. 
line 10032=>     'A  Ring  of  Power  looks   after  itself,  Frodo.  It  may  slip  off 
line 10033=>treacherously, but its keeper never  abandons it. At most he  plays with the 
line 10034=>idea of handing  it on  to someone else's care  - and  that  only at an early 
line 10035=>stage, when it first  begins  to grip. But  as  far as I know Bilbo alone in 
line 10036=>history has ever gone beyond playing, and  really done it.  He needed all my 
line 10037=>help, too. And even  so he would never  have just  forsaken  it, or  cast it 
line 10038=>aside. It  was not Gollum, Frodo, but the  Ring  itself that decided things.  
line 10039=>The Ring left him.' 
line 10040=>     'What, just in time  to meet Bilbo?' said Frodo. 'Wouldn't an  Orc have 
line 10041=>suited it better?' 
line 10042=>     'It  is no laughing  matter,'  said Gandalf. 'Not for you.  It was  the 
line 10043=>strangest event in the  whole history of the  Ring so far:  Bilbo's  arrival 
line 10044=>just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark. 
line 10045=>
line 10046=>####-     'There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The  Ring was  trying to 
line 10047=>get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur's hand and betrayed him; 
line 10048=>then when a  chance came it caught poor Deal, and he was murdered; and after  
line 10049=>that Gollum,  and it had devoured him. It could make  no further use of him:  
line 10050=>he was too  small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never  
line 10051=>leave his deep pool again. So  now, when its master was awake  once more and 
line 10052=>sending out his dark  thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to 
line 10053=>be 
line 10054=>picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!  
line 10055=>     'Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the 
line 10056=>Ring-maker.  I can put it no plainer than by saying that Bilbo was meant  to 
line 10057=>find the Ring, and not by its maker.  In which  case you  also were meant to 
line 10058=>have it. And that maybe an encouraging thought.' 
line 10059=>     It  is  not,' said Frodo. "Though I am not sure  that I understand you. 
line 10060=>But how have you  learned all this about the Ring, and about  Gollum? Do you  
line 10061=>really know it all, or are you just guessing still?' 
line 10062=>     Gandalf looked  at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. I knew much  and I have 
line 10063=>learned much,' he answered. 'But I am not  going to give an account of all my 
line 10064=>doings to you. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is  known  
line 10065=>to all the  Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by the fire-writing 
line 10066=>alone, apart from any  other evidence.' 'And  when  did you discover  that?' 
line 10067=>asked Frodo, interrupting. 'Just  now in this room, of course,' answered the 
line 10068=>wizard sharply.  'But  I expected to  find  it.  I have come back  from dark 
line 10069=>journeys and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof,  and 
line 10070=>all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum's part, and fitting it into the 
line 10071=>gap in the history, required some  thought. I may have  started with guesses 
line 10072=>about Gollum, but I am not guessing now. I know. I have seen him.' 
line 10073=>     'You have seen Gollum?' exclaimed Frodo in amazement. 
line 10074=>     'Yes. The obvious thing to do, of  course, if  one  could. I tried long 
line 10075=>ago; but I have managed it at last.' 
line 10076=>     'Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?' 
line 10077=>     'Not so  clearly.  What I  have told you is what Gollum was  willing to 
line 10078=>tell - though not, of course, in the  way  I have  reported it. Gollum  is a  
line 10079=>liar,  and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the  Ring his 
line 10080=>"birthday  present",  and he  stuck  to  that.  He  said it  came  from  his 
line 10081=>grandmother, who  had lots  of beautiful  things of  that kind. A ridiculous 
line 10082=>story. I have no doubt  that Smjagol's grandmother was a matriarch,  a great 
line 10083=>
line 10084=>####-person in her  way,  but to talk of  her  possessing  many  Elven-rings  was 
line 10085=>absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of 
line 10086=>truth. 
line 10087=>     'The  murder  of  Deal haunted  Gollum,  and he had made  up a defence, 
line 10088=>repeating  it  to his "precious" over and  over again, as he gnawed bones in 
line 10089=>the dark, until he almost  believed it. It  was   his birthday. Deal ought to 
line 10090=>have given the ring to him. It had  previously turned up  just so as to be a  
line 10091=>present. It was his birthday present, and so on, and on. 
line 10092=>     I  endured  him  as long  as  I could,  but  the truth  was desperately 
line 10093=>important, and in the end I  had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him, 
line 10094=>and wrung  the  true  story  out of  him, bit by  bit,  together  with  much 
line 10095=>snivelling  and snarling. He thought  he was misunderstood and ill-used. But 
line 10096=>when  he  had  at  last  told  me his history,  as  far  as  the end of  the 
line 10097=>Riddle-game  and Bilbo's escape, he would not say any more,  except in  dark 
line 10098=>hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was 
line 10099=>going  to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, 
line 10100=>and driven  into  a hole and  then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good 
line 10101=>friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That 
line 10102=>was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What  is more, he 
line 10103=>knew where he came from.' 
line 10104=>     'But how did he find that out?' asked Frodo. 
line 10105=>     'Well, as for the  name, Bilbo very foolishly told  Gollum himself; and 
line 10106=>after that  it  would  not be difficult to discover his country, once Gollum 
line 10107=>came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring proved stronger than 
line 10108=>his fear of the Orcs, or even of the light. After a year  or two he left the 
line 10109=>mountains. You  see, though  still  bound  by desire of it, the Ring was  no 
line 10110=>longer devouring him; he began  to revive a little.  He  felt  old , terribly 
line 10111=>old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry. 
line 10112=>     'Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always 
line 10113=>will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide  from daylight and 
line 10114=>moonshine,  and make his way swiftly  and softly by dead of night  with  his 
line 10115=>pale cold  eyes,  and  catch  small  frightened or  unwary  things. He  grew 
line 10116=>stronger  and  bolder  with new food  and  new air. He  found  his way  into 
line 10117=>Mirkwood, as one would expect.' 
line 10118=>     'Is that where you found him?' asked Frodo. 
line 10119=>     'I  saw  him there,' answered Gandalf, 'but before that he had wandered 
line 10120=>far, following  Bilbo's trail. It was difficult to  learn anything  from him 
line 10121=>
line 10122=>####-for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted  by curses and threats.  
line 10123=>"What had it  got in its pocketses?" he said. "It wouldn't say, no precious. 
line 10124=>Little cheat. Not a fair  question. It  cheated first, it did. It  broke the 
line 10125=>rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. And we will, precious!" 
line 10126=>     'That is a sample of his talk. I don't suppose you want any more. I had 
line 10127=>weary days  of it. But from hints dropped among  the snarls I  even gathered 
line 10128=>that his padding feet had  taken him  at last to Esgaroth, and even  to  the 
line 10129=>streets of Dale, listening secretly and peering. Well, the news of the great 
line 10130=>events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo's name  and 
line 10131=>knew where he came from.  We had made no secret of our return journey to his 
line 10132=>home in the West. Gollum's sharp ears would soon learn what he wanted.' 
line 10133=>     'Then why didn't  he track Bilbo further?' asked Frodo. 'Why didn't  he 
line 10134=>come to the Shire?' 
line 10135=>     'Ah,' said Gandalf, 'now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set 
line 10136=>out and  came  back westward, as far as the Great River. But  then he turned 
line 10137=>aside. He  was not daunted by  the distance, I am  sure.  No, something else 
line 10138=>drew him away. So my friends think, those that hunted him for me. 
line 10139=>     'The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail 
line 10140=>was  still fresh  then. Through Mirkwood and back again it  led them, though 
line 10141=>they never  caught him. The wood was full of  the  rumour  of  him, dreadful 
line 10142=>tales even among beasts and birds. The  Woodmen said that there was some 
line 10143=>new 
line 10144=>terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to  find nests; it 
line 10145=>crept into  holes  to  find  the young; it slipped  through windows  to find 
line 10146=>cradles. 
line 10147=>     'But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered 
line 10148=>off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves' ken, and was lost. And then 
line 10149=>I made a great mistake. Yes,  Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may 
line 10150=>prove the  worst. I let the matter be. I let  him go; for I had much else to 
line 10151=>think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman. 
line 10152=>     'Well, that was  years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and 
line 10153=>dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I took it up again, after Bilbo 
line 10154=>left here. And my search would  have been in vain,  but for the  help that I 
line 10155=>had from a friend: Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this  age 
line 10156=>of  the world.  Together we  sought  for  Gollum down  the  whole length  of 
line 10157=>Wilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given 
line 10158=>up the chase and turned to other parts, Gollum was found. My friend returned 
line 10159=>
line 10160=>####-out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him. 
line 10161=>     'What he had  been doing  he would not say. He only wept and  called us 
line 10162=>cruel,  with many a gollum in his throat; and when we pressed him he  whined 
line 10163=>and  cringed, and  rubbed his  long hands, licking his  fingers  as if  they 
line 10164=>pained  him, as if he remembered some old torture.  But I am afraid there is 
line 10165=>no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by 
line 10166=>mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.' 
line 10167=>     A heavy silence fell in the room.  Frodo could hear his  heart beating. 
line 10168=>Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam's  shears could now be 
line 10169=>heard. 
line 10170=>     'Yes,  to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things,  
line 10171=>and the Dark Power was bending all its will to  gather them there.  The Ring 
line 10172=>of the Enemy would leave  its  mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And 
line 10173=>all folk were whispering then of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred  
line 10174=>of  the  West.  There were his fine  new  friends, who would help him in his 
line 10175=>revenge!  
line 10176=>     'Wretched  fool!  In that land he  would  learn  much, too much for his 
line 10177=>comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on  the borders he would  
line 10178=>be caught, and taken - for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When 
line 10179=>he was found he  had already been  there long,  and was on his  way back. On 
line 10180=>some errand  of  mischief. But  that  does  not matter  much now. His  worst  
line 10181=>mischief was done. 
line 10182=>     'Yes, alas! through  him the  Enemy has learned that the One  has  been 
line 10183=>found again. He  knows where Isildur fell. He knows  where  Gollum found his 
line 10184=>ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that 
line 10185=>it is not one of the  Three, for they have  never been lost, and they endure 
line 10186=>no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine, for they are 
line 10187=>accounted for.  He  knows that it is  the One.  And he has  at last heard, I 
line 10188=>think, of hobbits and the Shire. 
line 10189=>     'The Shire - he may be seeking for  it now, if he has not already found 
line 10190=>out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that  he may  even think  that  the 
line 10191=>long-unnoticed name of Baggins has become important.' 
line 10192=>     'But this is  terrible!' cried Frodo. 'Far  worse than the worst that I 
line 10193=>imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best of friends, what am I 
line 10194=>to do? For now I am really afraid. What  am  I to do? What a pity that Bilbo  
line 10195=>did not stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!' 
line 10196=>     'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike 
line 10197=>
line 10198=>####-without need. And  he has been well rewarded, Frodo. Be sure that he took so 
line 10199=>little hurt from the evil,  and escaped  in  the  end, because he began  his 
line 10200=>ownership of the Ring so. With Pity.' 
line 10201=>     'I am sorry,' said  Frodo.  'But I am frightened; and I do not feel any 
line 10202=>pity for Gollum.' 
line 10203=>     'You have not seen him,' Gandalf broke in. 
line 10204=>     'No,  and I don't  want to,' said Frodo. I can't understand you. Do you  
line 10205=>mean to  say that you, and the Elves, have let him live on  after all  those 
line 10206=>horrible  deeds? Now at any rate he is  as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. 
line 10207=>He deserves death.' 
line 10208=>     'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some 
line 10209=>that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager  to 
line 10210=>deal out death in judgement.  For  even the very wise cannot see all ends. I 
line 10211=>have not much hope  that Gollum can be cured before  he dies, but there is a  
line 10212=>chance of it. And  he is bound  up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells 
line 10213=>me that  he  has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and 
line 10214=>when that comes, the pity  of Bilbo may  rule the fate  of many -  yours not 
line 10215=>least. In any case we did  not kill him:  he is very old  and very wretched. 
line 10216=>The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such  kindness as 
line 10217=>they can find in their wise hearts.' 
line 10218=>     'All the same,' said Frodo,  'even if  Bilbo could  not kill  Gollum, I 
line 10219=>wish he had not kept the  Ring. I wish he had never found it, and that I had 
line 10220=>not got it!  Why  did  you  let me keep it? Why didn't you make me  throw it  
line 10221=>away, or, or destroy it?' 
line 10222=>     'Let you? Make you?' sa id the  wizard.  'Haven't you been  listening to 
line 10223=>all  that I  have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying.  But as 
line 10224=>for throwing  it away,  that was  obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of 
line 10225=>being  found. In evil hands it might have done great evil. Worst  of all, it 
line 10226=>might have fallen into the  hands of the Enemy. Indeed  it certainly  would; 
line 10227=>for this is the One, and  he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it 
line 10228=>to himself. 
line 10229=>     'Of  course, my  dear  Frodo,  it  was dangerous  for you; and that has 
line 10230=>troubled me deeply. But there  was so  much at stake that I had to take some 
line 10231=>risk  - though even when  I was far away there has never been a day when the 
line 10232=>Shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I  
line 10233=>did not think  that the Ring would have  any lasting effect on  you, not for 
line 10234=>evil,  not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine 
line 10235=>
line 10236=>####-years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little for certain.' 
line 10237=>     'But  why  not destroy  it, as you say should have been done long ago?' 
line 10238=>cried Frodo again. If you had warned me, or even  sent me a message, I would 
line 10239=>have done away with it.' 
line 10240=>     'Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?' 
line 10241=>     'No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.' 
line 10242=>     'Try!' said Gandalf. Try now!' 
line 10243=>     Frodo drew the Ring  out of his pocket again and looked  at it. It  now 
line 10244=>appeared  plain and smooth, without  mark or device that  he  could see. The 
line 10245=>gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was 
line 10246=>its  colour,  how perfect was  its  roundness. It was an admirable thing and 
line 10247=>altogether  precious. When he  took  it out he had intended to fling it from 
line 10248=>him into the very hottest  part of the  fire. But he found now that he could 
line 10249=>not do so, not without a great  struggle. He weighed the  Ring in his  hand, 
line 10250=>hesitating,  and forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told  him; 
line 10251=>and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast  it away - 
line 10252=>but he found that he had put it back in his pocket. 
line 10253=>     Gandalf laughed grimly. 'You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily 
line 10254=>let  it  go,  nor will to damage it. And I  could not "make" you - except by 
line 10255=>force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking  the Ring, force  is 
line 10256=>useless. Even if you  took it and struck it  with a  heavy sledge -hammer,  it 
line 10257=>would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine. 
line 10258=>     'Your small  fire, of course, would  not melt even ordinary  gold. This 
line 10259=>Ring has already passed through it unscathed,  and even unheated.  But there 
line 10260=>is  no smith's forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the 
line 10261=>anvils and furnaces  of  the Dwarves could do that.  It has been  said  that 
line 10262=>dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings  of Power, but there is not now 
line 10263=>any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was  there 
line 10264=>ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the 
line 10265=>One 
line 10266=>Ring,  the Ruling Ring, for  that was  made by Sauron himself. There is only 
line 10267=>one  way:  to  find  the  Cracks  of Doom in  the  depths  of Orodruin,  the 
line 10268=>Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there, if you really wish to destroy it, 
line 10269=>to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.' 
line 10270=>     'I do  really wish to destroy it!'  cried Frodo. 'Or,  well, to have it 
line 10271=>destroyed. I am not  made for perilous  quests. I wish  I had never seen the 
line 10272=>Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?' 
line 10273=>
line 10274=>####-     'Such questions cannot be  answered,'  said Gandalf.  'You may be  sure 
line 10275=>that it was not  for any merit that others do not possess: not for  power or  
line 10276=>wisdom,  at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you  must therefore  use 
line 10277=>such strength and heart and wits as you have.' 
line 10278=>     'But I  have so  little of any  of  these  things!  You  are  wise  and 
line 10279=>powerful. Will you not take the Ring?' 
line 10280=>     'No!' cried Gandalf, springing  to  his feet. 'With that power I should 
line 10281=>have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring  would  gain a power  
line 10282=>still greater and more deadly.' His eyes flashed and his face  was lit as by 
line 10283=>a fire within.  'Do not tempt me! For I do not  wish to become like the  Dark 
line 10284=>Lord  himself. Yet the  way of the  Ring  to  my heart is by pity, pity  for  
line 10285=>weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do  not tempt me! I dare not  
line 10286=>take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too 
line 10287=>great, for my  strength.  I shall  have  such  need of it. Great  perils lie 
line 10288=>before me.' 
line 10289=>     He  went to the  window and drew aside the curtains  and the  shutters.  
line 10290=>Sunlight  streamed  back again into  the  room. Sam   passed  along the  path  
line 10291=>outside whistling. 'And now,'  said  the wizard, turning back to Frodo, 'the 
line 10292=>decision lies with you. But  I will always  help you.' He  laid his hand  on 
line 10293=>Frodo's shoulder. 'I will help you bear this  burden, as long as It is yours 
line 10294=>to bear. But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.' 
line 10295=>     There was a long  silence.  Gandalf  sat down again and puffed  at  his 
line 10296=>pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes  seemed closed, but under the  lids he 
line 10297=>was watching Frodo  intently. Frodo  gazed fixedly at the red embers on  the 
line 10298=>hearth,  until they filled all his vision,  and he seemed to be looking down 
line 10299=>into  profound  wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled  Cracks of Doom 
line 10300=>and the terror of the Fiery Mountain. 
line 10301=>     'Well!'  said Gandalf at last.  'What are you  thinking about? Have you  
line 10302=>decided what to do?' 
line 10303=>     'No!'  answered Frodo,  coming back to himself  out  of  darkness,  and 
line 10304=>finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out of the  window he 
line 10305=>could see the sunlit garden.   'Or perhaps, yes.  As far as I understand what 
line 10306=>you have said, I suppose I must keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the 
line 10307=>present, whatever it may do to me.' 
line 10308=>     'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with 
line 10309=>that purpose,' said  Gandalf.  
line 10310=>     'I hope so,'  said Frodo.  'But I  hope  that  you may  find some other  
line 10311=>
line 10312=>####-better  keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it  seems that I  am  a  danger, a  
line 10313=>danger  to all that live near  me.  I cannot  keep the Ring and stay here. I 
line 10314=>ought to leave   Bag End,  leave the Shire, leave everything and go away.' He 
line 10315=>sighed. 
line 10316=>     'I should like to  save  the Shire, if I could  - though there have been 
line 10317=>times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have 
line 10318=>felt that an earthquake or  an invasion of dragons might  be good  for them. 
line 10319=>But  I don't feel  like that  now. I feel  that  as  long as the Shire  lies 
line 10320=>behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find  wandering more bearable: I shall 
line 10321=>know that somewhere there is a firm  foothold, even if my feet  cannot stand 
line 10322=>there again. 
line 10323=>     'Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that 
line 10324=>as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like Bilbo's  or better, ending 
line 10325=>in  peace. But this  would  mean exile,  a  flight from danger into  danger, 
line 10326=>drawing  it after me. And I suppose I  must go alone, if I am to do that and 
line 10327=>save  the Shire.  But I  feel very  small, and  very  uprooted,  and  well - 
line 10328=>desperate. The Enemy is so strong and terrible.' 
line 10329=>     He did  not tell  Gandalf, but as  he  was speaking a  great desire  to 
line 10330=>follow  Bilbo flamed up in his heart  - to follow Bilbo, and even perhaps  to 
line 10331=>find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he  could almost  
line 10332=>have run out there and then down the road without his hat, as Bilbo ha d done 
line 10333=>on a similar morning long ago. 
line 10334=>     'My  dear  Frodo!'  exclaimed  Gandalf.  'Hobbits  really  are  amazing 
line 10335=>creatures, as I have said before. You  can learn all that there  is  to know 
line 10336=>about their  ways in a month, and yet after  a hundred  years they can still 
line 10337=>surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected to get  such  an answer, not even 
line 10338=>from  you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though  he little 
line 10339=>thought how important it  would prove. I am afraid  you are  right. The Ring 
line 10340=>will not be able to stay hidden in the  Shire much longer; and for  your own 
line 10341=>sake, as  well  as  for others, you  will have to go, and leave the  name of 
line 10342=>Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the Shire or  
line 10343=>in the Wild. I will give  you a travelling name now. When you go, go as  Mr. 
line 10344=>Underhill. 
line 10345=>     'But I don't think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can 
line 10346=>trust, and who would be willing  to go by your side  -  and that you would be 
line 10347=>willing to take  into unknown perils.  But  if you look for a  companion, be 
line 10348=>careful in choosing! And be  careful of what  you say,  even to your closest  
line 10349=>
line 10350=>####-friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.' 
line 10351=>     Suddenly he  stopped as if  listening.  Frodo became aware that all was 
line 10352=>very quiet,  inside and  outside. Gandalf  crept to one side of  the window.  
line 10353=>Then with  a  dart he  sprang to  the sill,  and thrust a  long arm out  and 
line 10354=>downwards. There was a squawk, and up came Sam Gamgee's curly head 
line 10355=>hauled by 
line 10356=>one ear. 
line 10357=>     'Well, well, bless my beard!' said Gandalf. 'Sam Gamgee is it? Now what 
line 10358=>may you be doing?' 
line 10359=>     'Lor bless  you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!' said Sam. 'Nothing! Leastways I was 
line 10360=>just  trimming the grass-border  under  the window,  if you  follow me.'  He 
line 10361=>picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence. 
line 10362=>     'I don't,' said Gandalf grimly. It is some time  since I last heard the 
line 10363=>sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?' 
line 10364=>     'Eavesdropping,  sir? I don't  follow you, begging  your pardon.  There 
line 10365=>ain't no eaves at Bag End, and that's a fact.' 
line 10366=>     'Don't be  a  fool! What  have  you  heard,  and why  did you  listen?' 
line 10367=>Gandalf's eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.  
line 10368=>     'Mr. Frodo, sir!' cried Sam quaking. 'Don't let him hurt me, sir! Don't  
line 10369=>let  him turn  me  into anything unnatural!  My old  dad would take on so. I 
line 10370=>meant no harm, on my honour, sir!' 
line 10371=>     'He  won't hurt you,' said Frodo,  hardly able to keep  from  laughing, 
line 10372=>although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. 'He knows, as well as I  
line 10373=>do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight 
line 10374=>away!' 
line 10375=>     'Well, sir,' said Sam dithering a little. 'I heard a deal that I didn't 
line 10376=>rightly  understand,  about an  enemy, and  rings, and  Mr. Bilbo, sir,  and 
line 10377=>dragons, and a  fiery mountain, and - and  Elves, sir. I listened because  I 
line 10378=>couldn't help  myself, if you know what I mean. Lor bless  me, sir, but I do 
line 10379=>love tales of  that sort. And  I believe  them  too,  whatever Ted may  say. 
line 10380=>Elves,  sir! I  would dearly love  to see  them. Cou ldn't you take  me to see 
line 10381=>Elves, sir, when you go?' 
line 10382=>     Suddenly Gandalf laughed. 'Come  inside!' he shouted,  and  putting out 
line 10383=>both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings and all, 
line 10384=>right through the window and stood him on the floor. 'Take you to see Elves, 
line 10385=>eh?' he  said, eyeing Sam  closely, but with a smile flickering on his face. 
line 10386=>'So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?' 
line 10387=>
line 10388=>####-     'I  did,  sir.  And that's why I choked:  which  you heard seemingly. I 
line 10389=>tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.' 
line 10390=>     'It can't be  helped, Sam,' said  Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized 
line 10391=>that  flying  from the Shire  would mean  more painful partings than  merely 
line 10392=>saying farewell  to  the familiar comforts of Bag End. 'I shall have to  go. 
line 10393=>But' - and  here he looked  hard at Sam  - 'if you really care about me, you  
line 10394=>will keep that dead secret. See? If you don't, if you even breathe a word of 
line 10395=>what you've heard here, then  I  hope  Gandalf will turn you into a  spotted 
line 10396=>toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.' 
line 10397=>     Sam fell on his knees,  trembling. 'Get  up, Sam!' said Gandalf. I have 
line 10398=>thought of something better than  that. Something  to shut your  mouth,  and  
line 10399=>punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!' 
line 10400=>     'Me,  sir!' cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk.  'Me 
line 10401=>go and see Elves and all! Hooray!' he shouted, and then burst into tears.  
line 10402=> 
line 10403=>
line 10404=>####- 
line 10405=>
line 10406=>Chapter 3. Three is Company 
line 10407=>
line 10408=> 
line 10409=> 
line 10410=>     'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to  go soon,' said Gandalf. Two 
line 10411=>or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made  no sign of getting ready to 
line 10412=>go. 
line 10413=>     'I know. But it is difficult to do both,' he objected. If I just vanish 
line 10414=>like Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in no time.' 
line 10415=>     'Of course you mustn't vanish!' said Gandalf. 'That wouldn't do at all! 
line 10416=>I said soon, not instantly. If  you can think of any way of slipping out  of 
line 10417=>the  Shire  without  its  being generally known, it will  be  worth a little 
line 10418=>delay. But you must not delay too long.' 
line 10419=>     'What  about the  autumn, on  or after  Our Birthday?' asked  Frodo. 'I  
line 10420=>think I could probably make some arrangements by then.' 
line 10421=>     To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come 
line 10422=>to  the  point. Bag End seemed a more  desirable residence than  i t  had for 
line 10423=>years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the 
line 10424=>Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart would think 
line 10425=>more kindly  of journeying, as it always did at that season. He  had  indeed 
line 10426=>privately made up his mind to leave on his  fiftieth birthday:  Bilbo's  one 
line 10427=>hundred and twenty-eighth. It  seemed somehow the proper day on which to set 
line 10428=>out and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and  the  one 
line 10429=>thing  that made the thought  of leaving  bearable. He  thought as little as 
line 10430=>possible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in  the end. But he did 
line 10431=>not tell all his  thoughts to Gandalf. What the  wizard  guessed  was always 
line 10432=>difficult to tell. 
line 10433=>     He looked at Frodo and smiled. 'Very well,' he said. 'I think that will 
line 10434=>do -  but  it must not  be any  later. I  am getting  very anxious.  In  the 
line 10435=>mean-while, do take care, and don't let out any hint of where you are going!  
line 10436=>And  see  that Sam Gamgee does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him 
line 10437=>into a toad.' 
line 10438=>     'As for  where I am going,' said Frodo, 'it would be  difficult to give 
line 10439=>that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.' 
line 10440=>     'Don't be absurd!' said Gandalf. 'I  am not warning you against leaving 
line 10441=>an  address  at the post -office!  But you are leaving the  Shire   - and that 
line 10442=>should not be known,  until you  are far away. And  you must go, or at least 
line 10443=>
line 10444=>####-set  out,  either North,  South,  West  or East  -  and  the direction should 
line 10445=>certainly not be known.' 
line 10446=>     'I have been so  taken up with the thoughts of leaving  Bag End, and of 
line 10447=>saying  farewell, that I have  never even  considered  the  direction,' said 
line 10448=>Frodo. 'For where am I to go? And by  what  shall I  steer? What is to be my  
line 10449=>quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure, there and back aga in; but I go to lose 
line 10450=>one, and not return, as far as I can see.' 
line 10451=>     'But you cannot  see very far,' said Gandalf. 'Neither can I. It may be 
line 10452=>your task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be for others: I do 
line 10453=>not know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.' 
line 10454=>     'No  indeed!' said  Frodo.  'But  in the  meantime what course am I  to 
line 10455=>lake?' 
line 10456=>     'Towards  danger; but not  too  rashly, nor too straight,' answered the 
line 10457=>wizard. 'If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That journey  should not 
line 10458=>prove too  perilous, though the  Road is less easy than it was, and it  will 
line 10459=>grow worse as the year fails.' 
line 10460=>     'Rivendell!' said  Frodo. 'Very good:  I will go east, and  I will make 
line 10461=>for Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he will be delighted.' He 
line 10462=>spoke lightly;  but his heart was  moved  suddenly with  a desire to see the 
line 10463=>house of Elrond  Halfelven, and  breathe the  air  of that deep valley where 
line 10464=>many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace. 
line 10465=>     One summer's evening an astonishing piece of news  reached the Ivy Bush 
line 10466=>and Green Dragon. Giants and other portents on the borders of the Shire were 
line 10467=>forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was  selling Bag End, indeed 
line 10468=>he had already sold it - to the Sackville-Bagginses!  
line 10469=>     'For a nice bit, loo,' said some.  'At a bargain price,'  said  others,  
line 10470=>'and that's more likely when Mistress Lobelia's  the  buyer.' (Otho had died 
line 10471=>some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.) 
line 10472=>     Just  why  Mr.  Frodo  was selling  his  beautiful hole was  even  more 
line 10473=>debatable than the price. A  few held the theory - supported by the nods and  
line 10474=>hints  of Mr. Baggins himself  - that Frodo's money was  running out: he  was 
line 10475=>going to leave Hobbiton and live in a  quiet way on the proceeds of the sale 
line 10476=>down  in  Buckland  among   his  Brandybuck  relations.  'As  far  from  the 
line 10477=>Sackville-Bagginses  as may be,'  some added.  But  so firmly fixed  had the 
line 10478=>notion of  the immeasurable wealth  of the Bagginses of Bag End  become that 
line 10479=>most found this  hard to believe, harder than  any  other reason or unreason 
line 10480=>that  their fancy  could suggest:  to  most  it suggested  a  dark  and  yet 
line 10481=>
line 10482=>####-unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go 
line 10483=>about by day, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in the  Bag End'. But 
line 10484=>however a removal might  fit in with the  designs of his wizardry, there was 
line 10485=>no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland. 
line 10486=>     'Yes, I shall be moving  this autumn,' he  said.  'Merry Brandybuck  is 
line 10487=>looking out  for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.' 
line 10488=>     As a matter of fact with  Merry's help he had already chosen and bought 
line 10489=>a little house  at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all  but 
line 10490=>Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision 
line 10491=>to set out eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on  the 
line 10492=>eastern borders  of  the Shire, and as he had lived there  in childhood  his 
line 10493=>going back would at least seem credible. 
line 10494=>     Gandalf  stayed in the Shire for over two months.  Then one evening, at 
line 10495=>the end of  June, soon  after Frodo's  plan  had  been finally  arranged, he 
line 10496=>suddenly  announced that  he was going off  again next morning.  'Only for a 
line 10497=>short  while, I hope,'  he said.  'But  I am  going down beyond the southern 
line 10498=>borders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.' 
line 10499=>     He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried. 
line 10500=>'Has anything happened?' he asked. 
line 10501=>     'Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs 
line 10502=>looking into. If I think it necessary after all  for you to get off at once, 
line 10503=>I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick  
line 10504=>to your plan; but be more careful than ever, especially of the  Ring.  Let me 
line 10505=>impress on you once more: don't use it!'  
line 10506=>     He  went off at dawn.  'I may be back any day,'  he  said. 'At the very 
line 10507=>latest I shall come back  for  the farewell party. I think after all you may 
line 10508=>need my company on the Road.' 
line 10509=>     At first  Frodo  was a  good deal  disturbed,  and wondered often  what 
line 10510=>Gandalf could  have  heard; but his  uneasiness wore  off, and in  the  fine  
line 10511=>weather  he forgot his  troubles for a  while. The  Shire had seldom seen so 
line 10512=>fair a summer, or so rich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey 
line 10513=>was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full. 
line 10514=>     Autumn was well under  way  before  Frodo began to worry  about Gandalf 
line 10515=>again.  September  was  passing  and there  was  still no  news of him.  The 
line 10516=>Birthday, and the removal, drew  nearer, and still he did not come,  or send 
line 10517=>word.  Bag End began to be busy.  Some of Frodo's friends  came  to stay and 
line 10518=>help  him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco  Boffin, and 
line 10519=>
line 10520=>####-of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between 
line 10521=>them 
line 10522=>they turned the whole place upside-down. 
line 10523=>     On  September  20th  two  covered  carts  went off  laden  to Buckland, 
line 10524=>conveying  the furniture and goods that Frodo had not  sold to his new home, 
line 10525=>by way of the  Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became  really anxious, 
line 10526=>and kept  a constant look -out  for  Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning,  
line 10527=>dawned as fair and  clear  as it had long ago for Bilbo's great party. Still 
line 10528=>Gandalf did not appear. In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was 
line 10529=>quite small, just  a  dinner  for himself  and his four helpers; but  he was 
line 10530=>troubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought  that he would so soon have 
line 10531=>to part  with his young  friends weighed  on his heart. He  wondered how  he 
line 10532=>would break it to them. 
line 10533=>     The four younger  hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party 
line 10534=>soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf's absence. The dining-room was 
line 10535=>bare except for a table  and  chairs,  but the food  was good, and there was 
line 10536=>good  wine:  Frodo's  wine  had  not  been  included  in  the  sale  to  the 
line 10537=>Sackville-Bagginses. 
line 10538=>     'Whatever happens to  the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s  get  their 
line 10539=>claws on  it, at any rate I have found a good home for this!' said Frodo, as 
line 10540=>he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards.  
line 10541=>     When they had sung many songs, and talked of  many things they had done 
line 10542=>together,  they toasted  Bilbo's birthday, and  they  drank his  health  and 
line 10543=>Frodo's together according to Frodo's custom. Then they went out for a sniff 
line 10544=>of air, and glimpse of the stars, and then  they went to bed.  Frodo's party 
line 10545=>was over, and Gandalf had not come. 
line 10546=>     The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder 
line 10547=>of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove off with Fatty (that is 
line 10548=>Fredegar  Bolger).  'Someone must get there and  warm the house  before  you  
line 10549=>arrive,' said Merry.  'Well, see you later - the day  after tomorrow,  if you  
line 10550=>don't go to sleep on the way!' 
line 10551=>     Folco went  home  aft er lunch,  but Pippin remained behind.  Frodo  was 
line 10552=>restless and anxious,  listening in vain for a  sound of Gandalf. He decided 
line 10553=>to  wait until  nightfall. After that,  if  Gandalf wanted him urgently,  he 
line 10554=>would go to Crickhollow, and might even get there first. For Frodo was going 
line 10555=>on foot. His plan - for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any 
line 10556=>other reason  -  was to walk from Hobbiton to  Bucklebury  Ferry, taking  it 
line 10557=>
line 10558=>####-fairly easy. 
line 10559=>     'I shall  get  myself a bit  into  training,  too,' he said, looking at 
line 10560=>himself  in  a dusty mirror in the  half-empty  hall.  He  had  not done any 
line 10561=>strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection  looked rather flabby, 
line 10562=>he thought. 
line 10563=>     After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, 
line 10564=>Lotho, turned  up, much to Frodo's annoyance. 'Ours at last!' said  Lobelia, 
line 10565=>as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of 
line 10566=>Bag  End  did not take effect  until  midnight.  But Lobelia  can perhaps be 
line 10567=>forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years  longer for  
line 10568=>Bag End  than she once hoped, and she was now  a  hundred years old. 
line 10569=>Anyway, 
line 10570=>she had  come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and 
line 10571=>she wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought 
line 10572=>a complete inventory  with her and went  right through  it. In  the end  she 
line 10573=>departed with Lotho and  the spare  key and  the promise that the  other key 
line 10574=>would  be  left at  the  Gamgees' in Bagshot Row.  She  snorted, and  showed 
line 10575=>plainly that she  thought the Gamgees  capable of plundering the hole during  
line 10576=>the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea. 
line 10577=>     He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee  in the  kitchen. It had 
line 10578=>been  officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland  'to  do for  Mr. 
line 10579=>Frodo and look after his bit of garden'; an arrangement that was approved by 
line 10580=>the Gaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of having Lobelia  
line 10581=>as a neighbour. 
line 10582=>     'Our  last meal at  Bag End!'  said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They 
line 10583=>left the washing up  for Lobelia.  Pippin  and Sam  strapped  up their three 
line 10584=>packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for a last  stroll in the 
line 10585=>garden. Sam disappeared. 
line 10586=>     The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. 
line 10587=>Frodo 
line 10588=>wandered round the familiar rooms,  and saw the light  of the sunset fade on 
line 10589=>the walls,  and  shadows  creep out  of  the  corners.  It  grew slowly dark 
line 10590=>indoors. He went out and walked down to  the gate at the bottom of the path,  
line 10591=>and then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half expected to  see Gandalf 
line 10592=>come striding up through the dusk. 
line 10593=>     The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. 'It's going  to be 
line 10594=>a fine night,'  he  said  aloud.  'That's good for a beginning.  I feel like 
line 10595=>
line 10596=>####-walking. I  can't  bear any  more  hanging about. I am going  to start,  and 
line 10597=>Gandalf must follow  me.'  He  turned to go back, and  then  slopped, for he 
line 10598=>heard voices, just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was 
line 10599=>certainly the old Gaffer's;  the other was strange, and  somehow  unpleasant. 
line 10600=>He could not make out what it said, but he heard the Gaffer's answers, which 
line 10601=>were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out. 
line 10602=>     'No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Sam went 
line 10603=>with 
line 10604=>him: anyway all  his stuff went.  Yes, sold out and  gone,  I tell'ee.  Why?  
line 10605=>Why's none of my business, or yours.  Where to?  That ain't no  secret. He's 
line 10606=>moved to Bucklebury or some such place, away down yonder. Yes it is  - a tidy 
line 10607=>way.  I've never been so far myself; they're  queer folks in Buckland. No, I 
line 10608=>can't give no message. Good night to you!' 
line 10609=>     Footsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why  the fact 
line 10610=>that they did not  come on up the Hill seemed a  great relief. 'I am sick of 
line 10611=>questions a nd curiosity  about my doings,  I  suppose,' he thought. 'What an 
line 10612=>inquisitive lot they all  are!' He had half a mind to go and ask  the Gaffer  
line 10613=>who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and 
line 10614=>walked quickly back to Bag End. 
line 10615=>     Pippin was sitting on his pack  in  the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo 
line 10616=>stepped inside the dark door. 'Sam!' he called. 'Sam! Time!' 
line 10617=>     'Coming, sir!' came  the answer  from far within, followed soon by  Sam 
line 10618=>himself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell to the beer -barrel in 
line 10619=>the cellar. 
line 10620=>     'All aboard, Sam?' said Frodo. 
line 10621=>     'Yes, sir. I'll last for a bit now, sir.' 
line 10622=>     Frodo shut and locked the  round door, and  gave the key  to Sam.  'Run 
line 10623=>down with this to your home, Sam!' he said. 'Then cu t along the Row and meet 
line 10624=>us as quick as you can at the gate in the  lane  beyond the meadows.  We are 
line 10625=>not  going  through  the village  tonight.  Too  many ears pricking and eyes 
line 10626=>prying.' Sam ran off at full speed. 
line 10627=>     'Well, now we're off at last!'  said  Frodo. They shouldered their packs 
line 10628=>and took up their sticks, and  walked round the corner to the  west  side of 
line 10629=>Bag End. 'Good-bye!' said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows. He 
line 10630=>waved 
line 10631=>his hand, and then turned and (following Bilbo, if  he had known it) hurried 
line 10632=>after Peregrin down  the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in  the 
line 10633=>
line 10634=>####-hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a  
line 10635=>rustle in the grasses.  
line 10636=>     At the bottom of the  Hill  on its western  side they came  to  the gate 
line 10637=>opening on to a  narrow lane.  There they  halted and adjusted the straps of 
line 10638=>their packs. Presently  Sam  appeared, trotting quickly and  breathing hard; 
line 10639=>his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head 
line 10640=>a tall shapeless fell  bag, which  he called  a hat. In the gloom  he looked 
line 10641=>very much like a dwarf. 
line 10642=>     'I am sure you  have given me all the heaviest stuff,'  said Frodo.  'I  
line 10643=>pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.' 
line 10644=>     'I could take a lot  more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,' said Sam 
line 10645=>stoutly and untruthfully. 
line 10646=>     'No, you  don't,  Sam!' said  Pippin.  'It is  good  for him. He's  got 
line 10647=>nothing except what he ordered us to pack. He's been slack lately, and he'll 
line 10648=>feel the weight less when he's walked off some of his own.' 
line 10649=>     'Be kind to a poor old hobbit!' laughed Frodo. 'I shall be as thin as a  
line 10650=>willow-wand, I'm sure, before I get to Buckland. But I was talking nonsense. 
line 10651=>I suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, and I shall look into  it 
line 10652=>at our next  packing.'  He  picked  up his  stick  again. 'Well, we all like 
line 10653=>walking  in the dark,' he said,  'so let's put  some miles  behind us before 
line 10654=>bed.' 
line 10655=>     For a short way they followed  the lane westwards. Then leaving it they 
line 10656=>turned left and took quietly to  the  fields again. They went in single file 
line 10657=>along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them. 
line 10658=>In their  dark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings. 
line 10659=>Since they were  all hobbits, and were  trying  to be silent,  they made  no 
line 10660=>noise that even hobbits would  hear. Even the wild things in  the fields and 
line 10661=>woods hardly noticed their passing. 
line 10662=>     After  some  time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow 
line 10663=>plank -bridge.  The stream  was  there no more than  a winding  black ribbon,  
line 10664=>bordered with leaning  alder -trees. A mile or two further south they hastily 
line 10665=>crossed the great  road  from  the Brandywine Bridge; they were  now in  the 
line 10666=>Tookland and  bending south-eastwards they made for the  Green Hill Country. 
line 10667=>As they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and  saw the  lamps  
line 10668=>in Hobbiton far off twinkling in  the gentle  valley of  the  Water. Soon it 
line 10669=>disappeared  in the  folds of the darkened land, and was followed by Bywater 
line 10670=>beside  its grey pool. When the  light of  the  last  farm was  far  behind, 
line 10671=>
line 10672=>####-peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell. 
line 10673=>     'I wonder if  I shall ever  look down into that valley  again,' he said 
line 10674=>quietly. 
line 10675=>     When they  had walked for about three hours they rested. The night  was 
line 10676=>clear,  cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up  the 
line 10677=>hill-sides from the streams and deep  meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in 
line 10678=>a light wind  above their heads, made a black net aga inst the pale sky. They 
line 10679=>ate a  very  frugal supper (for hobbits), and  then went on again. Soon they 
line 10680=>struck a narrow road, that  went rolling  up and down,  fading grey into the 
line 10681=>darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and  Stock, and the Bucklebury  Ferry. 
line 10682=>It climbed away from the  main road  in the Water-valley, and wound over the 
line 10683=>skirts  of  the  Green  Hills  towards  Woody-End,  a  wild  corner  of  the 
line 10684=>Eastfarthing. 
line 10685=>     After a while  they plunged into  a deeply  cloven  track  between tall 
line 10686=>trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was very dark. At first  
line 10687=>they  talked,  or hummed a  tune  softly together, being  now far  away from 
line 10688=>inquisitive ears. Then they marched  on in silence,  and Pippin began to lag 
line 10689=>behind.  At  last, as  they began to   climb  a  steep slope, he  stopped and 
line 10690=>yawned. 
line 10691=>     'I  am  so sleepy,' he said,  'that soon I shall fall down on the road. 
line 10692=>Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.' 
line 10693=>     'I thought you liked walking in the dark,' said Frodo. 'But there is no 
line 10694=>great  hurry.  Merry expects  us some time the day after  tomorrow; but that 
line 10695=>leaves us nearly two days more. We'll halt at the first likely spot.' 
line 10696=>     'The  wind's in  the West,' said Sam. 'If  we get to the other  side of 
line 10697=>this hill,  we shall find  a spot  that  is  sheltered and snug  enough, sir. 
line 10698=>There is  a dry fir-wood just ahead,  if  I  remember rightly.' Sam knew the 
line 10699=>land well  within twenty miles of  Hobbiton, but that was  the  limit of his 
line 10700=>geography. 
line 10701=>     Just  over the  top  of  the  hill they came on  the patch of fir-wood. 
line 10702=>Leaving  the  road  they  went into  the deep resin -scented  darkness of the 
line 10703=>trees, and  gathered  dead  sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a  
line 10704=>merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it 
line 10705=>for  a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an  angle  of the great 
line 10706=>tree's roots, they curled  up  in  their cloaks and blankets, and were  soon 
line 10707=>fast asleep. They set no  watch; even Frodo feared  no danger yet,  for they 
line 10708=>were still in  the heart  of the Shire. A few  creatures came and  looked at 
line 10709=>
line 10710=>####-them when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business 
line 10711=>of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed. 
line 10712=>     'Hobbits!' he thought. 'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings 
line 10713=>in this land,  but  I have  seldom  heard of a hobbit  sleeping out of doors 
line 10714=>under a tree. Three of them! There's something mighty queer behind this.' He 
line 10715=>was quite right, but he never found out any more about it. 
line 10716=>     The morning came,  pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that 
line 10717=>a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff. 
line 10718=>     'Walking for pleasure! Why didn't  I drive?'  he thought, as he usually 
line 10719=>did at the beginning of an expedition. 'And all  my  beautiful feather  beds 
line 10720=>are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These  tree -roots would  do them good.' 
line 10721=>He stretched. 'Wake up, hobbits!' he cried. It's a beautiful morning.' 
line 10722=>     'What's beautiful about it?' said Pippin, peering  over the edge of his 
line 10723=>blanket with one eye. 'Sam! Gel breakfast ready for half-past nine! Have you 
line 10724=>got the bath-water hot?' 
line 10725=>     Sam jumped up,  looking rather  bleary. 'No,  sir, I haven't, sir!'  he 
line 10726=>said. 
line 10727=>     Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and  rolled him  over, and then 
line 10728=>walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was rising red out 
line 10729=>of the mists that lay thick  on  the world. Touched  with  gold and red  the 
line 10730=>autumn trees seemed to  be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below 
line 10731=>him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared. 
line 10732=>     When  he returned  Sam  and  Pippin had got a good fire going. 'Water!' 
line 10733=>shouted Pippin. 'Where's the water?' 
line 10734=>     'I  don't keep  water in my  pockets,' said  Frodo. 'We thought you had 
line 10735=>gone to find  some,' said Pippin, busy  setting out the food, and cups. 'You  
line 10736=>had better go now.' 
line 10737=>     'You  can come too,'  said  Frodo, 'and  bring  all the water -bottles.' 
line 10738=>There was  a stream at the foot of the hill. They  filled their  bottles and 
line 10739=>the small  camping kettle at a little fall  where the water fell  a few feet 
line 10740=>over an outcrop  of grey stone. It  was  icy cold;  and they spluttered  and 
line 10741=>puffed as they bathed their faces and hands.  
line 10742=>     When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it 
line 10743=>was after  ten o'clock, and the day was beginning to turn fine and hot. They 
line 10744=>went  down the slope, and across the stream where  it  dived under the road,  
line 10745=>and up the next slope, and up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by 
line 10746=>that time their cloaks, blankets, water , food, and other gear already seemed 
line 10747=>
line 10748=>####-a heavy burden. 
line 10749=>     The day's march promised to be warm and tiring  work. After some miles, 
line 10750=>however, the road  ceased to roll up and  down: it climbed  to the  top of a  
line 10751=>steep bank in a weary zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to  go down 
line 10752=>for  the last time. In front of  them they saw  the lower lands  dotted with 
line 10753=>small clumps of  trees that melted away in  the distance to a brown woodland 
line 10754=>haze. They were looking across the  Woody End towards  the Brandywine 
line 10755=>River. 
line 10756=>The road wound away before them like a piece of string. 
line 10757=>     'The road goes on  for ever,' said Pippin; 'but I can't without a rest. 
line 10758=>It is  high time for lunch.' He sat down on the bank at the side of the road 
line 10759=>and looked  away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end 
line 10760=>of the Shire in which he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him. His round 
line 10761=>eyes were wide open  - for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a 
line 10762=>new horizon. 
line 10763=>     'Do Elves live in those woods?' he asked. 
line 10764=>     'Not that I ever  heard,' said Pippin.  Frodo  was silent.  He  too was 
line 10765=>gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it  before. Suddenly 
line 10766=>he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly: 
line 10767=>     The Road goes ever on and on  
line 10768=>     Down from the door where it began. 
line 10769=>     Now far ahead the Road has gone, 
line 10770=>     And I must follow, if I can, 
line 10771=>     Pursuing it with weary feet, 
line 10772=>     Until it joins some larger way, 
line 10773=>     Where many paths and errands meet. 
line 10774=>     And whither then? I cannot say. 
line 10775=>     'That sounds  like a bit of old Bilbo's rhyming,' said Pippin. 'Or is it 
line 10776=>one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.' 
line 10777=>     'I don't know,' said Frodo. It came to me then, as  if I was making  it 
line 10778=>up; but I  may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds  me very much of 
line 10779=>Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was 
line 10780=>only  one  Road;  that it was like a great river: its  springs were at every 
line 10781=>doorstep,  and every path was  its  tributary. "It's  a dangerous  business,  
line 10782=>Frodo, going out of your door," he used to say. "You step into the Road, and 
line 10783=>if you don't keep your feet,  there is no knowing where  you might  be swept  
line 10784=>off to.  Do you realize  that  this  is the  very  path  that  goes  through 
line 10785=>
line 10786=>####-Mirkwood,  and that if you  let it, it  might take you to the Lonely Mountain 
line 10787=>or  even  further and to worse places?"  He  used to say  that  on  the path 
line 10788=>outside the  front door at  Bag End, especially  after he had been out for a  
line 10789=>long walk.' 
line 10790=>     'Well,  the Road won't sweep me  a nywhere for an  hour  at least,' said 
line 10791=>Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example,  putting their 
line 10792=>packs against the bank and their  legs out  into the road. After a rest they 
line 10793=>had a good lunch, and then more rest. 
line 10794=>     The sun was beginning to get  low and the light of afternoon was on the 
line 10795=>land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road. 
line 10796=>This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little 
line 10797=>traffic to  the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour  or 
line 10798=>more when Sam  stopped a  moment as  if  listening. They were  now on  level 
line 10799=>ground,  and  the  road  after  much  winding  lay  straight  ahead  through 
line 10800=>grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods.  
line 10801=>     'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,' said Sam. 
line 10802=>     They  looked back, but the turn of the  road prevented them from seeing 
line 10803=>far. 'I wonder if that  is Gandalf coming after us,' said Frodo; but even as 
line 10804=>he said it, he had a feeling  that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide 
line 10805=>from the view of the rider came over him. 
line 10806=>     'It  may not matter much,' he  said apologetically, 'but I would rather  
line 10807=>not be seen on the  road  - by anyone. I am  sick of my  doings being noticed  
line 10808=>and discussed. And if  it is Gandalf,' he added as  an afterthought, 'we can 
line 10809=>give him  a little surprise, to pay him out for being so late. Let's get out 
line 10810=>of sight!' 
line 10811=>     The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not 
line 10812=>far  from the  road. There  they lay  flat. Frodo  hesitated  for  a second: 
line 10813=>curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire  to hide. The 
line 10814=>sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of 
line 10815=>long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head 
line 10816=>and peered cautiously above one of the great roots. 
line 10817=>     Round the  corner came  a black horse, no hobbit-pony  but a full-sized 
line 10818=>horse;  and  on  it sat  a large man,  who seemed to  crouch in  the saddle, 
line 10819=>wrapped in a great black  cloak and  hood, so that only his boots in the high 
line 10820=>stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible. 
line 10821=>     When it reached the  tree and was level with Frodo  the  horse stopped. 
line 10822=>The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From 
line 10823=>
line 10824=>####-inside the hood came  a  noise as of  someone sniffing to  catch an  elusive 
line 10825=>scent; the head turned from side to side of the road. 
line 10826=>     A sudden  unreasoning  fear of  discovery laid hold  of Frodo,  and  he 
line 10827=>thought  of his Ring. He hardly dared  to breathe,  and yet the desire to get 
line 10828=>it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. 
line 10829=>He felt  that  he had only to  slip  it on, and then he  would  be safe. The 
line 10830=>advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. 'And I am still in 
line 10831=>the Shire,' he thought, as his hand touched the chain on  which  it hung. At  
line 10832=>that moment  the  rider  sat up,  and  shook the  reins.  The  horse stepped 
line 10833=>forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot. 
line 10834=>     Frodo crawled to  the edge of the road and watched the rider,  until he 
line 10835=>dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him 
line 10836=>that suddenly, before it  passed out  of sight,  the horse turned aside  and 
line 10837=>went into the trees on the right. 
line 10838=>     'Well, I  call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,' said  Frodo  to 
line 10839=>himself, as he  walked towards his companions. Pippin and  Sam  had remained 
line 10840=>flat  in the  grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo  described the rider and 
line 10841=>his strange behaviour. 
line 10842=>     'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or smelling for me; 
line 10843=>and also I felt certain that I did  not want him to discover  me. I've never 
line 10844=>seen or fell anything like it in the Shire before.' 
line 10845=>     'But what has  one of the Big  People got  to do with us?' said Pippin. 
line 10846=>'And what is he doing in this part of the world?' 
line 10847=>     'There are some Men about,' said Frodo. 'Down in the Southfarthing they  
line 10848=>have  had trouble  with Big  People,  I believe. But I have  never heard  of 
line 10849=>anything like this rider. I wonder  where he comes from.' 
line 10850=>     'Begging  your  pardon,' put  in Sam  suddenly,  'I know where he comes 
line 10851=>from. It's from Hobbiton that  this here black  rider comes, unless  there's 
line 10852=>more than one. And I know where he's going to.' 
line 10853=>     'What do you mean?' said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment.  
line 10854=>'Why didn't you speak up before?' 
line 10855=>     'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to 
line 10856=>our  hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he says to me: Hello, Sam! 
line 10857=>he says. I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There's been a  
line 10858=>strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and he's only just gone. 
line 10859=>I've sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that I liked the sound of him. He seemed 
line 10860=>mighty put out, when I told him Mr. Baggins had  left his old home for good. 
line 10861=>
line 10862=>####-Hissed at me, he did.  It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was  
line 10863=>he? says I to the Gaffer. / don't know,  says he; but he wasn't a hobbit. He 
line 10864=>was tall and black-like, and he  stooped aver me. I reckon it was one of the 
line 10865=>Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke funny. 
line 10866=>     'I  couldn't stay  to  hear more, sir, since  you were  waiting; and  I 
line 10867=>didn't give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting old, and more than 
line 10868=>a bit blind,  and it  must have been  near dark when this fellow come up the 
line 10869=>Hill  and  found him taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope  he hasn't 
line 10870=>done no harm, sir, nor me.' 
line 10871=>     'The Gaffer can't be blamed anyway,' said Frodo. 'As a matter of fact I 
line 10872=>heard him talking to a  stranger, who  seemed to  be inquiring for me, and I 
line 10873=>nearly went and asked him who it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about 
line 10874=>it before. I might have been more careful on the road.' 
line 10875=>     'Still, there may be no connexion between  this rider and the  Gaffer's 
line 10876=>stranger,' said Pippin. 'We left Hobbiton  secretly enough, and  I don't see 
line 10877=>how he could have followed us.' 
line 10878=>     'What about the smelling, sir?' said Sam. 'And the Gaffer said he was a  
line 10879=>black chap.' 
line 10880=>     'I wish  I had  waited  for  Gandalf,' Frodo  muttered. 'But perhaps it 
line 10881=>would only have made matters worse.' 
line 10882=>     'Then you know  or guess something about this  rider?' said Pippin, who 
line 10883=>had caught the muttered words.  
line 10884=>     'I don't know, and I would rather  not guess,'  said Frodo. 'All right, 
line 10885=>cousin Frodo! You can  keep your  secret for the present,  if you want to be 
line 10886=>mysterious. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a  bite and  a  
line 10887=>sup,  but somehow  I think  we had better move on from here.  Your  talk  of 
line 10888=>sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me.' 
line 10889=>     'Yes, I think we  will move on now,' said Frodo;  'but  not on the road 
line 10890=>-in case  that rider comes back, or another  follows him. We  ought to do  a  
line 10891=>good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.' 
line 10892=>     The shadows  of  the trees  were long and  thin  on the  grass, as they 
line 10893=>started off again. They now kept  a stone's throw to  the left of  the road, 
line 10894=>and kept out of sight of it as much  as they  could. But this hindered them; 
line 10895=>for the grass was thick and  tussocky, and the ground uneven, and the  trees 
line 10896=>began to draw together into thickets.  
line 10897=>     The sun had gone down  red behind the hills at their backs, and evening 
line 10898=>was coming on before they came back to the road at the end of the long level 
line 10899=>
line 10900=>####-over which  it had run straight for  some miles.  At that point it bent left 
line 10901=>and  went down into the lowlands of  the Yale  making for Stock;  but a lane 
line 10902=>branched right, winding  through a  wood of ancient oak-trees on its way  to 
line 10903=>Woodhall. 'That is the way for us,' said Frodo. 
line 10904=>     Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk  of a tree: it 
line 10905=>was  still alive  and had leaves  on  the small branches that it had put out 
line 10906=>round the  broken  stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it  was hollow,  and 
line 10907=>could  be entered  by  a great  crack  on the  side  away from the road. The 
line 10908=>hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor  of old leaves and  decayed 
line 10909=>wood.  They rested and had a light  meal, talking quietly and listening from 
line 10910=>time to time. 
line 10911=>     Twilight  was about  them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind 
line 10912=>was sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering. Soon the  road began to 
line 10913=>fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A  star  came out above the trees in 
line 10914=>the darkening East before them.  They went  abreast  and in step, to keep up 
line 10915=>their spirits.  After  a time, as the stars  grew thicker and  brighter, the 
line 10916=>feeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened  for the sound of 
line 10917=>hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk 
line 10918=>along,  especially  when  they  are drawing near to home at night. With most  
line 10919=>hobbits  it  is  a supper -song  or a bed-song;  but these  hobbits  hummed a  
line 10920=>walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). 
line 10921=>Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune  that  was as old as  the hills, 
line 10922=>and taught  it to Frodo as they walked in the  lanes of the Water -valley and 
line 10923=>talked about Adventure. 
line 10924=>     Upon the hearth the fire is red, 
line 10925=>     Beneath the roof there is a bed; 
line 10926=>     But not yet weary are our feet, 
line 10927=>     Still round the corner we may meet 
line 10928=>     A sudden tree or standing stone 
line 10929=>     That none have seen but we alone. 
line 10930=>     Tree and flower and leaf and grass, 
line 10931=>     Let them pass! Let them pass! 
line 10932=>     Hill and water under sky, 
line 10933=>     Pass them by! Pass them by! 
line 10934=> 
line 10935=>     Still round the corner there may  wait 
line 10936=>     A new road or a secret gate, 
line 10937=>
line 10938=>####-     And though we pass them by today, 
line 10939=>     Tomorrow we may come this way 
line 10940=>     And take the hidden paths that run 
line 10941=>     Towards the Moon or to the Sun. 
line 10942=>     Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe, 
line 10943=>     Let them go! Let them go! 
line 10944=>     Sand and stone and pool and dell, 
line 10945=>     Fare you well! Fare you well! 
line 10946=> 
line 10947=>     Home is behind, the world ahead, 
line 10948=>     And there are many paths to tread 
line 10949=>     Through shadows to the edge of night, 
line 10950=>     Until the stars are all alight. 
line 10951=>     Then world behind and home ahead, 
line 10952=>     We'll wander back to home and bed. 
line 10953=>     Mist and twilight, cloud and shade, 
line 10954=>     Away shall fade! Away shall fade! 
line 10955=>     Fire and lamp, and meat and bread, 
line 10956=>     And then to bed! And then to bed! 
line 10957=>     The song ended. 'And now to bed! And now to bed!' sang Pippin in a high 
line 10958=>voice. 
line 10959=>     'Hush!' said Frodo. 'I think I hear hoofs again.' 
line 10960=>     They slopped suddenly  and  stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. 
line 10961=>There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and 
line 10962=>clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and  ran 
line 10963=>into the deeper shade under the oak-trees. 
line 10964=>     'Don't let  us go too far!' said Frodo. 'I don't want to be seen, but I 
line 10965=>want to see if it is another Black Rider.' 
line 10966=>     'Very well!' said Pippin. 'But don't forget the sniffing!' 
line 10967=>     The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better  
line 10968=>than the general  darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a 
line 10969=>large tree-bole, while  Frodo  crept back a few yards  towards  the lane. It 
line 10970=>showed grey and pale, a line  of fading light through the wood. Above it the 
line 10971=>stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon. 
line 10972=>     The sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw something dark pass 
line 10973=>across  the lighter  space between two trees, and then halt. It looked  like 
line 10974=>the  black shade of a horse led by a smaller black  shadow. The black shadow 
line 10975=>
line 10976=>####-stood close  to the point where they had left the  path, and it  swayed from 
line 10977=>side to side. Frodo thought he heard the sound of  snuffling. The shadow bent 
line 10978=>to the ground, and then began to crawl towards him. 
line 10979=>     Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time 
line 10980=>it was stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he  realized what 
line 10981=>he was  doing, his hand was groping  in his pocket. But at that moment there 
line 10982=>came  a sound  like mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in  
line 10983=>the starlit air. The black shadow straightened up and retreated.  It climbed 
line 10984=>on to the  shadowy  horse  and  seemed  to  vanish  across the lane into the 
line 10985=>darkness on the other side. Frodo breathed again. 
line 10986=>     'Elves!' exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. 'Elves, sir!' He would have 
line 10987=>burst  out of the trees and dashed off towards  the voices, if they  had not 
line 10988=>pulled him back. 
line 10989=>     'Yes,  it  is Elves,' said  Frodo. 'One can meet them sometimes  in the 
line 10990=>Woody End.  They don't live in the Shire, but they  wander into it in Spring 
line 10991=>and  Autumn,  out  of their own  lands away  beyond the  Tower Hills.  I  am 
line 10992=>thankful that they do! You did not  see, but  that Black  Rider stopped just  
line 10993=>here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he 
line 10994=>heard the voices he slipped away.' 
line 10995=>     'What  about the Elves?'  said  Sam, too  excited  to trouble about the 
line 10996=>rider. 'Can't we go and see them?' 
line 10997=>     'Listen! They are coming this way,' said Frodo. 'We have only to wait.' 
line 10998=>The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above  the others.  It was 
line 10999=>singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo knew only a little, and the 
line 11000=>others knew nothing. Yet  the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape 
line 11001=>itself  in their thought into words which they only partly understood.  This 
line 11002=>was the song as Frodo heard it: 
line 11003=>     Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear! 
line 11004=>     O Queen beyond the Western Seas! 
line 11005=>     O Light to us that wander here 
line 11006=>     Amid the world of woven trees! 
line 11007=> 
line 11008=>     Gilthoniel! O Elbereth! 
line 11009=>     Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath! 
line 11010=>     Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee 
line 11011=>     In a far land beyond the Sea. 
line 11012=> 
line 11013=>
line 11014=>####-     O stars that in the Sunless Year 
line 11015=>     With shining hand by her were sawn, 
line 11016=>     In windy fields now bright and clear 
line 11017=>     We see your silver blossom blown! 
line 11018=> 
line 11019=>     O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! 
line 11020=>     We still remember, we who dwell 
line 11021=>     In this far land beneath the trees, 
line 11022=>     Thy starlight on the Western Seas. 
line 11023=>     The  song  ended.  'These  are High  Elves!  They  spoke  the  name  of 
line 11024=>Elbereth!' said Frodo in amazement,  'Few of that fairest folk are ever seen 
line 11025=>in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth,  east  of the  Great Sea. 
line 11026=>This is indeed a strange chance!' 
line 11027=>     The hobbits  sat in shadow  by the wayside. Before long the Elves  came 
line 11028=>down the lane towards the valley. They  passed slowly, and the hobbits could 
line 11029=>see the starlight glimmering on their hair and  in their  eyes. They bore no  
line 11030=>lights,  yet as they walked a  shimmer, like the light of the moon above the 
line 11031=>rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were 
line 11032=>now silent, and  as the last Elf  passed  he turned  and looked  towards the 
line 11033=>hobbits and laughed. 
line 11034=>     'Hail,  Frodo!' he  cried. 'You  are  abroad  late. Or are  you perhaps 
line 11035=>lost?'  Then he called aloud  to the others, and all the company stopped and 
line 11036=>gathered round. 
line 11037=>     'This  is indeed  wonderful!'  they  said. 'Three hobbits in  a wood at 
line 11038=>night! We  have not seen  such a thing  since Bilbo went away.  What is  the 
line 11039=>meaning of it?' 
line 11040=>     'The meaning of it, fair people,'  said Frodo, 'is simply that  we seem 
line 11041=>to be going the same  way as you are. I like  walking under the stars. But I 
line 11042=>would welcome your company.' 
line 11043=>     'But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are  so  dull,' they 
line 11044=>laughed. 'And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do 
line 11045=>not 
line 11046=>know whither we are going?' 
line 11047=>     'And how do you know my name?' asked Frodo in return. 
line 11048=>     'We know many things,'  they said. 'We have seen you often before  with 
line 11049=>Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.' 
line 11050=>     'Who are you, and who is your lord?' asked Frodo. 
line 11051=>
line 11052=>####-     'I am Gildor,' answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him. 
line 11053=>'Gildor Inglorion of  the  House  of Finrod. We are Exiles, and most of  our 
line 11054=>kindred have long  ago  departed and  we  too are  now only  tarrying here a  
line 11055=>while, ere we return  over the Great Sea.  But some  of  our kinsfolk  dwell 
line 11056=>still  in peace in Rivendell.  Come now, Frodo, tell us what you  are doing?  
line 11057=>For we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you.' 
line 11058=>     'O Wise  People!' interrupted Pippin eagerly. 'Tell us about  the Black  
line 11059=>Riders!' 
line 11060=>     'Black Riders?' they said  in  low voices. 'Why  do you ask a bout Black  
line 11061=>Riders?' 
line 11062=>     'Because two Black Riders have  overtaken us today,  or one has done so 
line 11063=>twice,' said Pippin;  'only a little while ago  he slipped away as you  drew 
line 11064=>near.' 
line 11065=>     The Elves did not answer at  once, but spoke together  softly  in their 
line 11066=>own tongue.  At length Gildor turned to the  hobbits. 'We  will not speak of 
line 11067=>this here,' he said. 'We think you had  best come now with us. It is not our 
line 11068=>custom, but for this time we will lake you on our road, and  you shall lodge 
line 11069=>with us tonight, if you  will.' 
line 11070=>     'O Fair  Folk!  This is good fortune beyond my hope,' said  Pippin. Sam 
line 11071=>was speechless.  'I  thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,' said Frodo bowing. 
line 11072=>'Elen snla l®menn' omentielvo, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,' he 
line 11073=>added in the high-elven speech. 
line 11074=>     'Be careful,  friends!' cried  Gildor laughing. 'Speak no secrets! Here 
line 11075=>is  a  scholar in  the  Ancient  Tongue.  Bilbo  was a  good  master.  Hail, 
line 11076=>Elf-friend!' he said, bowing to Frodo.  'Come now with your friends and join 
line 11077=>our company! You had best walk in the middle so  that you may not stray. You  
line 11078=>may be weary before we halt.' 
line 11079=>     'Why? Where are you going?' asked Frodo. 
line 11080=>     'For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some 
line 11081=>miles, but  you shall have  rest at  the  end of it, and it will shorten your 
line 11082=>journey tomorrow.' 
line 11083=>     They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint 
line 11084=>lights: for  Elves  (even  more  than hobbits)  could walk when they  wished  
line 11085=>without sound or footfall.  Pippin soon began  to feel sleepy, and staggered 
line 11086=>once  or twice; but each time a tall Elf at his side  put out  his  arm  and 
line 11087=>saved him from a  fall. Sam walked along at Frodo's side, as if in a  dream, 
line 11088=>with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished  joy. 
line 11089=>
line 11090=>####-     The  woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and 
line 11091=>thicker;  and as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, 
line 11092=>there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. At  
line 11093=>last the Elves turned aside from the path.  A  green ride  lay almost unseen 
line 11094=>through the  thickets on the right; and this they  followed as it wound away 
line 11095=>back up the  wooded slopes on to the  top of a shoulder of  the  hills  that 
line 11096=>stood out into the lower land of the river -valley. Suddenly they came out of 
line 11097=>the shadow of  the trees, and  before them lay a  wide space of  grass, grey 
line 11098=>under the night. On three sides the woods  pressed upon it; but eastward the 
line 11099=>ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of 
line 11100=>the slope,  were  below their feet. Beyond, the  low lands  lay dim and flat 
line 11101=>under the stars.  Nearer  at hand  a few lights twinkled  in the village  of 
line 11102=>Woodhall. 
line 11103=>     The  Elves sat on  the grass  and spoke  together in  soft voices; they 
line 11104=>seemed to take no further  notice of the hobbits.  Frodo and his  companions 
line 11105=>wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole  over  them. 
line 11106=>The  night grew  on,  and  the  lights in the valley  went out. Pippin  fell 
line 11107=>asleep, pillowed on a green hillock. 
line 11108=>     Away  high  in the East swung Remmirath,  the Netted Stars,  and slowly 
line 11109=>above  the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some 
line 11110=>shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned  up, 
line 11111=>as  he  climbed  over  the  rim  of the  world, the  Swordsman  of  the  Sky, 
line 11112=>Menelvagor with  his shining  belt. The  Elves all burst into song. Suddenly 
line 11113=>under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light. 
line 11114=>     'Come!' the  Elves called to the hobbits. 'Come!  Now is  the time  for 
line 11115=>speech and merriment!' 
line 11116=>     Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. 'There is a fire in the 
line 11117=>hall, and food for hungry guests,' said an Elf standing before him. 
line 11118=>     At the south  end of the greensward  there  was an opening.  There  the 
line 11119=>green  floor  ran on into the wood, and formed a  wide  space like  a  hall, 
line 11120=>roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each 
line 11121=>side. In the middle there was a wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars 
line 11122=>torches with lights of gold and silver were burning  steadily. The Elves sat 
line 11123=>round the  fire upon the grass or  upon the  sawn  rings of old trunks. Some 
line 11124=>went  to  and  fro bearing cups and  pouring  drink; others brought  food on 
line 11125=>heaped plates and dishes.  
line 11126=>     'This  is poor fare,' they said  to the hobbits; 'for we are lodging in 
line 11127=>
line 11128=>####-the greenwood far from  our halls. If ever  you are our guests at  home,  we 
line 11129=>will treat you better.' 
line 11130=>     'It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,' said Frodo. 
line 11131=>     Pippin afterwards recalled little o f either food or drink, for his mind 
line 11132=>was  filled  with the  light upon the elf-faces, and the  sound of voices so 
line 11133=>various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking  dream.  But he remembered  
line 11134=>that there was bread, surpassing the savour of a fair white  loaf to one who 
line 11135=>is starving;  and fruits  sweet  as  wildberries  and richer than the tended 
line 11136=>fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, 
line 11137=>cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer afternoon. 
line 11138=>     Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what 
line 11139=>he felt or thought that  night, though it remained in  his  memory as one of 
line 11140=>the chief  events of his life.  The  nearest he  ever got was to say: 'Well, 
line 11141=>sir, if I could grow  apples like that, I would call  myself a gardener. But 
line 11142=>it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.' 
line 11143=>     Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was 
line 11144=>chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened 
line 11145=>eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in 
line 11146=>their own language. They smiled at  him  and said laughing: 'Here is a jewel 
line 11147=>among hobbits!' 
line 11148=>     After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away 
line 11149=>to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and  slept the 
line 11150=>rest  of the night away. Sam refused to  leave  his  master. When Pippin had 
line 11151=>gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and 
line 11152=>closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor. 
line 11153=>     They  spoke of many things, old  and new,  and Frodo questioned  Gildor  
line 11154=>much about happenings  in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were 
line 11155=>mostly  sad and ominous: of  gathering  darkness, the wars  of Men,  and the 
line 11156=>flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked  the question  that  was nearest to 
line 11157=>his heart: 
line 11158=>     'Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?' 
line 11159=>     Gildor  smiled.  'Yes,' he answered.  'Twice. He said farewell to us on 
line 11160=>this very  spot. But I saw  him once again, far  from here.' He would say no 
line 11161=>more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent. 
line 11162=>     'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,' said 
line 11163=>Gildor. 'But I already know a little, and I  can read more in your  face and 
line 11164=>in the thought behind your questions. You are leaving the Shire, and yet you  
line 11165=>
line 11166=>####-doubt that you will find  what you seek, or accomplish what  you intend,  or  
line 11167=>that you will ever return. Is not that so?' 
line 11168=>     'It is,' said Frodo; 'but I thought my going was a secret known only to 
line 11169=>Gandalf and my faithful Sam.' He looked down at Sam, who was snoring 
line 11170=>gently. 
line 11171=>     'The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,' said Gildor. 
line 11172=>     'The Enemy?' said Frodo. 'Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?' 
line 11173=>     'I  do not know  for what  reason the Enemy is pursuing you,'  answered 
line 11174=>Gildor; 'but I perceive that he is  - strange indeed though that seems to me. 
line 11175=>And I warn  you  that peril is now both before you  and behind you, and upon 
line 11176=>either side.' 
line 11177=>     'You  mean the Riders? I feared  that  they were servants of the Enemy. 
line 11178=>What are the Black Riders?' 
line 11179=>     'Has Gandalf told you nothing?' 
line 11180=>     'Nothing about such creatures.' 
line 11181=>     'Then I think it  is not  for me to say more  - lest terror should keep 
line 11182=>you from your journey. For it seems to me that you  have set out only just in 
line 11183=>time, if  indeed you are in time. You must now make  haste, and neither stay 
line 11184=>nor turn back; for the Shire is no longer any protection to you.' 
line 11185=>     'I cannot  imagine what information could be more terrifying  than your 
line 11186=>hints  and warnings,' exclaimed Frodo. 'I knew  that  danger lay  ahead,  of 
line 11187=>course; but I did not expect to  meet it in  our  own Shire.  Can't a hobbit 
line 11188=>walk from the Water to the River in peace?' 
line 11189=>     'But  it is not your own Shire,' said Gildor. 'Others dwelt here before 
line 11190=>hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The 
line 11191=>wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for  
line 11192=>ever fence it out.' 
line 11193=>     'I know - and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I 
line 11194=>do  now?  My  plan was  to  leave  the Shire  secretly, and  make my  way to 
line 11195=>Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland.' 
line 11196=>     'I  think you should still follow that  plan,'  said Gildor.  'I do not 
line 11197=>think the Road  will prove too  hard for  your courage. But  if  you  desire 
line 11198=>clearer counsel, you should ask  Gandalf. I do not know the reason  for your  
line 11199=>flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your  pursuers will assail  
line 11200=>you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you  will see him before 
line 11201=>you leave the Shire?' 
line 11202=>     'I hope so. But that is another  thing that  makes  me anxious. I  have 
line 11203=>
line 11204=>####-been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come to Hobbiton at 
line 11205=>the 
line 11206=>latest two  nights  ago; but he has  never appeared. Now I am wondering what 
line 11207=>can have happened. Should I wait for him?' 
line 11208=>     Gildor  was silent for a moment. 'I do not like this news,' he said  at 
line 11209=>last.  'That Gandalf should be late, does not  bode well. But it is said: Do 
line 11210=>not meddle  in  the  affairs  o f Wizards, for they  are subtle  and quick to  
line 11211=>anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait.' 
line 11212=>     'And  it  is also  said,'  answered  Frodo:  'Go not  to the  Elves for 
line 11213=>counsel, for they will say both no and yes.' 
line 11214=>     'Is it  indeed?' laughed Gildor. 'Elves  seldom give  unguarded advice, 
line 11215=>for advice is a  dangerous gift,  even from  the  wise to the wise, and  all 
line 11216=>courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning 
line 11217=>yourself; and how then shall  I choose better  than you? But if  you  demand  
line 11218=>advice, I will for friendship's sake give it.  I think you  should now go at 
line 11219=>once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I  
line 11220=>also advise  this:  do not  go  alone. Take such friends  as are trusty  and 
line 11221=>willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do  not give this counsel gladly. 
line 11222=>The Elves have their  own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little  
line 11223=>concerned  with the ways of  hobbits,  or of any other creatures upon earth. 
line 11224=>Our  paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting  there 
line 11225=>may be more than chance; but the purpose  is not clear to  me, and I fear to 
line 11226=>say too much.' 
line 11227=>     'I am  deeply grateful,' said  Frodo;  'but  I  wish you would  tell me 
line 11228=>plainly what the  Black  Riders  are. If I  take your  advice I may not  see 
line 11229=>Gandalf for  a  long while,  and I ought to know what  is  the  danger  that 
line 11230=>pursues me.' 
line 11231=>     'Is  it not  enough to  know  that they  are servants  of  the  Enemy?' 
line 11232=>answered Gildor. 'Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are deadly. Ask no 
line 11233=>more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you,  Frodo son of 
line 11234=>Drogo, will  know more  of  these  fell things than  Gildor  Inglorion.  May 
line 11235=>Elbereth protect you!' 
line 11236=>     'But where shall I find courage?' asked Frodo. 'That is what I  chiefly 
line 11237=>need.' 
line 11238=>     'Courage is found in unlikely places,' said  Gildor. 'Be  of good hope!  
line 11239=>Sleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we will send our  messages 
line 11240=>
line 11241=>####-through  the lands.  The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey, 
line 11242=>and 
line 11243=>those that have power for good shall be on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; 
line 11244=>and  may the stars shine upon the end  of your road! Seldom have we had such 
line 11245=>delight in strangers,  and it  is  fair to hear words  of the Ancient Speech 
line 11246=>from the lips of other wanderers in the world.' 
line 11247=>     Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor  finished speaking. 'I  
line 11248=>will sleep now,' he said; and the  Elf led him to a bower beside Pippin, and 
line 11249=>he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber. 
line 11250=> 
line 11251=>
line 11252=>####- 
line 11253=>
line 11254=>Chapter 4. A Short Cut to Mushrooms 
line 11255=>
line 11256=> 
line 11257=> 
line 11258=>     In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in  a bower made by a 
line 11259=>living tree  with branches laced  and drooping to the ground; his bed was of 
line 11260=>fern and grass,  deep and soft  and  strangely fragrant. The sun was shining 
line 11261=>through  the fluttering leaves,  which were still green  upon the  tree.  He 
line 11262=>jumped up and went out. 
line 11263=>     Sam  was  sitting  on the grass near the  edge  of the wood. Pippin was 
line 11264=>standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign of the Elves.  
line 11265=>     'They have left us fruit  and drink, and bread,' said Pippin. 'Come and 
line 11266=>have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did last night. I 
line 11267=>did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.' 
line 11268=>     Frodo  sat  down  beside  Sam and began  to eat. 'Wha t is the  plan for  
line 11269=>today?' asked Pippin. 
line 11270=>     'To  walk  to Bucklebury as  quickly as possible,'  answered Frodo, and 
line 11271=>gave his attention to the food. 
line 11272=>     'Do you think  we shall see  anything  of  those Riders?' asked  Pippin 
line 11273=>cheerfully. Under  the  morning  sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of 
line 11274=>them did not seem very alarming to him. 
line 11275=>     'Yes, probably,' said Frodo, not liking  the reminder. 'But  I  hope to 
line 11276=>get across the river without their seeing us.' 
line 11277=>     'Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?' 
line 11278=>     'Not much  - only hints and riddles,' said Frodo evasively. 'Did you ask  
line 11279=>about the sniffing?' 
line 11280=>     'We didn't discuss it,' said Frodo with his mouth full. 
line 11281=>     'You should have. I am sure it is very important.' 
line 11282=>     'In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused  to explain it,' said 
line 11283=>Frodo sharply. 'And now leave me in peace  for a bit! I don't want to answer  
line 11284=>a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!' 
line 11285=>     'Good heavens!' said Pippin. 'At breakfast?' He walked away towards the 
line 11286=>edge of the green. 
line 11287=>     From Frodo's mind the bright morning - treacherously bright, he thought  
line 11288=>- had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of Gildor. 
line 11289=>The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running  on the green turf and 
line 11290=>singing. 
line 11291=>
line 11292=>####-     'No!  I could  not!' he said  to  himself.  'It is one thing to take my 
line 11293=>young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we are hungry and weary, 
line 11294=>and food  and  bed are  sweet.  To  take them into exile,  where  hunger and 
line 11295=>weariness may ha ve  no cure,  is quite another  - even if they are willing to 
line 11296=>come. The inheritance  is mine  alone.  I don't think I  ought  even to take 
line 11297=>Sam.' He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him. 
line 11298=>     'Well, Sam!' he said. 'What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as 
line 11299=>ever I  can - in fact I  have made up my mind now not even to wait  a day at 
line 11300=>Crickhollow, if it can be helped.' 
line 11301=>     'Very good, sir!' 
line 11302=>     'You still mean to come with me?' 
line 11303=>     'I do.' 
line 11304=>     'It  is going to be very dangerous, Sam. 'It is already dangerous. Most  
line 11305=>likely neither of us will come back.' 
line 11306=>     'If you don't come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,' said Sam. 
line 11307=>'Don't you leave him! they said to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I 
line 11308=>am  going  with  him, if   he climbs to the Moon,  and if  any of those Black 
line 11309=>Rulers try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said. They 
line 11310=>laughed.' 
line 11311=>     'Who are they, and what are you talking about?' 
line 11312=>     'The  Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and  they seemed to know 
line 11313=>you were going away, so I didn't see the use of denying  it. Wonderful folk, 
line 11314=>Elves, sir! Wonderful!' 
line 11315=>     'They are,' said Frodo.  'Do you like  them still,  now  you have had a  
line 11316=>closer view?' 
line 11317=>     'They  seem a bit above my likes and dislikes,  so  to speak,' answered 
line 11318=>Sam slowly. 'It don't seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite 
line 11319=>different from what I expected - so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it 
line 11320=>were.' 
line 11321=>     Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some  outward 
line 11322=>sign of the odd change that seemed  to have come  over him. It did not sound 
line 11323=>like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he  knew. But it looked 
line 11324=>like the old  Sam Gamgee sitting  there, except that  his face was unusually 
line 11325=>thoughtful. 
line 11326=>     'Do  you feel any  need to  leave the Shire now  - now that your wish to 
line 11327=>see them has come true already?' he asked. 
line 11328=>     'Yes,  sir. I  don't  know how to  say it, but after last night  I feel 
line 11329=>
line 11330=>####-different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind  of way.  I know  we are going  to 
line 11331=>take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't  
line 11332=>to see Elves now, nor dragons, nor mountains, that  I want  - I don't rightly 
line 11333=>know what I  want: but I  have something to do before the end, and  it  lies 
line 11334=>ahead, not  in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.' 
line 11335=>     'I don't  altogether.  But I  understand  that Gandalf chose me a  good 
line 11336=>companion. I am content. We will go together.' 
line 11337=>     Frodo finished his  breakfast in silence.  Then standing  up he  looked 
line 11338=>over the land ahead, and called to Pippin. 
line 11339=>     'All ready to start?' he said as Pippin ran up. 'We must be getting off 
line 11340=>at once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.' 
line 11341=>     'You slept  late, you mean,' said Pippin. 'I was up long before; and we 
line 11342=>are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.' 
line 11343=>     'I  have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry 
line 11344=>as quickly  as possible. I am not  going out of the way, back to the road we 
line 11345=>left last night: I am going to  cut straight across country from here.' 
line 11346=>     'Then you are going to fly,'  said Pippin.  'You  won't cut straight on 
line 11347=>foot anywhere in this country.' 
line 11348=>     'We  can  cut  straighter than the road anyway,'  answered  Frodo. 'The 
line 11349=>Ferry is east from Woodhall;  but the hard road curves away to the left  -you  
line 11350=>can see a bend of it away north over there. It goes round  the north  end of 
line 11351=>the Marish so as to  strike  the causeway from  the  Bridge above Stock. But 
line 11352=>that is miles out of the way.  We could save a quarter  of the distance if we 
line 11353=>made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.' 
line 11354=>     'Short cuts make  long delays,' argued  Pippin. 'The  country  is rough 
line 11355=>round  here, and  there are bogs and  all  kinds of difficulties down in the 
line 11356=>Marish -I know the land  in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black 
line 11357=>Riders, I can't  see that it is any worse meeting  them on  a road than in a  
line 11358=>wood or a field.' 
line 11359=>     'It is  less  easy  to find people in the  woods and  fields,' answered 
line 11360=>Frodo. 'And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that 
line 11361=>you will be looked for on the road and not off it.' 
line 11362=>     'All right!' said Pippin. 'I will follow  you into every bog and ditch. 
line 11363=>But it is  hard! I had counted  on  passing the Golden Perch at Stock before 
line 11364=>sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time 
line 11365=>since I tasted it.' 
line 11366=>     'That settles it!'  said Frodo. 'Short cuts  make delays, but inns make 
line 11367=>
line 11368=>####-longer  ones. At all costs we must  keep  you away from the Golden Perch. We 
line 11369=>want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?' 
line 11370=>     'I  will go  along with you, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam (in spite of  private 
line 11371=>misgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in the Eastfarthing). 
line 11372=>     'Then  if we are going to toil  through bog and briar, let's  go  now!' 
line 11373=>said Pippin. 
line 11374=>     It was  already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds 
line 11375=>were  beginning  to come up from the West. It looked likely to turn to rain. 
line 11376=>The hobbits scrambled down a steep  green  bank and  plunged into the  thick 
line 11377=>trees below. Their course  had been chosen to  leave Woodhall to their left, 
line 11378=>and  to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side 
line 11379=>of  the  hills,  until they reached the flats  beyond. Then they  could make 
line 11380=>straight  for the Ferry over country that was open, except for a few ditches 
line 11381=>and fences. Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line. 
line 11382=>     He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it  had 
line 11383=>appeared. There were no paths  in the  undergrowth, and they did not  get on 
line 11384=>very  fast.  When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a  
line 11385=>stream  running  down from  the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with  steep 
line 11386=>slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the 
line 11387=>line they had chosen. They could  not jump over it, nor indeed get across it 
line 11388=>at  all without  getting wet, scratched, and muddy.  They  halted, wondering  
line 11389=>what to do.  'First check!' said Pippin, smiling grimly. 
line 11390=>     Sam Gamgee  looked back.  Through an opening  in  the trees he caught a 
line 11391=>glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down. 
line 11392=>     'Look!'  he said, clutching  Frodo by the  arm. They all looked, and on 
line 11393=>the edge high above  them they saw against the sky a horse  standing. Beside 
line 11394=>it stooped a black figure. 
line 11395=>     They  at once gave  up any  idea of going back. Frodo led  the way, and 
line 11396=>plunged quickly into the  thick bushes beside the stream. 'Whew!' he said to  
line 11397=>Pippin. 'We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but   we 
line 11398=>got under  cover only just in time. You've got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear  
line 11399=>anything coming?' 
line 11400=>     They  stood still,  almost holding  their breath as  they listened; but 
line 11401=>there was  no sound  of pursuit. 'I  don't fancy  he  would try bringing his 
line 11402=>hor se down that bank,' said Sam. 'But I guess he  knows we came down it.  We 
line 11403=>had better be going on.' 
line 11404=>     Going  on was  not altogether easy.  They had packs  to carry,  and the 
line 11405=>
line 11406=>####-bushes and  brambles were reluctant to  let  them through. They were cut off  
line 11407=>from the wind by  the ridge behind, and the air  was still  and stuffy. When 
line 11408=>they forced their way at last into more open ground, they were hot and tired 
line 11409=>and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in 
line 11410=>which they  were  going.  The banks of  the stream sank,  as it reached  the 
line 11411=>levels and  became broader  and shallower,  wandering off towards the Marish 
line 11412=>and the River. 
line 11413=>     'Why,  this  is  the Stock-brook!' said Pippin. 'If we are going to try 
line 11414=>and get back on to our course, we must  cross at once and bear right.' 
line 11415=>     They waded  the  stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown 
line 11416=>and treeless, on the  further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of 
line 11417=>trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here  and there an elm tree or  an 
line 11418=>ash. The ground was fairly level, and  there was little undergrowth; but the 
line 11419=>trees were loo close for them to see far  ahead.  The leaves blew upwards in 
line 11420=>sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. 
line 11421=>Then the wind died  away and the rain came streaming down. They trudged 
line 11422=>along 
line 11423=>as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through  thick  drifts  of 
line 11424=>old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered  and trickled. They did not 
line 11425=>talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side. 
line 11426=>     After  half an hour Pippin said: 'I hope  we  have not turned  too much 
line 11427=>towards the south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not  
line 11428=>a very broad belt --I should  have said  no more than a mile at the widest  - 
line 11429=>and we ought to have been through it by now.' 
line 11430=>     'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,' said Frodo. 'That won't  
line 11431=>mend  matters. Let us keep on as we  are going! I am not sure that I want to 
line 11432=>come out into the open yet.' 
line 11433=>     They  went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed 
line 11434=>out of ragged clouds  again and the rain  lessened. It was now past mid-day,  
line 11435=>and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its 
line 11436=>leaves  though fast turning yellow were still thick, and the  ground at  its 
line 11437=>feel  was fairly dry and sheltered. When  they came to make their meal, they 
line 11438=>found that  the  Elves had  filled their bottles  with  a  clear drink, pale 
line 11439=>golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made  of many flowers, and was 
line 11440=>wonderfully  refreshing. Very soon they  were  laughing, and snapping  their  
line 11441=>fingers at rain, and at Black Riders.  The last few  miles, they felt, would 
line 11442=>soon be behind them. 
line 11443=>
line 11444=>####-     Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam 
line 11445=>and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly: 
line 11446=>     Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go 
line 11447=>     To heal my heart and drown my woe. 
line 11448=>     Rain may fall and wind may blow,  
line 11449=>     And many miles be still to go, 
line 11450=>     But under a tall tree I will lie, 
line 11451=>     And let the clouds go sailing by. 
line 11452=>     Ho! Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo 
line 11453=>sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came  down the wind, like  the  cry of 
line 11454=>some evil  and  lonely  creature.  It  rose and fell, and  ended  on  a high 
line 11455=>piercing  note. Even as  they sat and stood, as  if suddenly frozen,  it was 
line 11456=>answered by another  cry, fainter and further off, but no less  chilling  to 
line 11457=>the blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in 
line 11458=>the leaves. 
line 11459=>     'And what do you think that was?' Pippin asked at last, trying to speak 
line 11460=>lightly, but quavering a little. 'If it was a bird, it was  one that I never  
line 11461=>heard in the Shire before.' 
line 11462=>     'It was not bird or beast,' said Frodo. 'It was a call, or  a signal -- 
line 11463=>there were words in that cry, though  I  could not catch them. But no hobbit 
line 11464=>has such a voice.' 
line 11465=>     No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no 
line 11466=>one  spoke of them. They  were now reluctant either to  stay  or go  on; but 
line 11467=>sooner or  later they had got to  get across the  open country to the Ferry, 
line 11468=>and  it was best to go  sooner  and  in daylight.  In a few moments they had 
line 11469=>shouldered their packs again and were off. 
line 11470=>     Before long the wood came  to a  sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched 
line 11471=>before them. They now saw that  they had, in  fact, turned too much  to  the 
line 11472=>south.  Away over  the  flats  they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury 
line 11473=>across the River, but it was now to their left. Creeping cautiously out from 
line 11474=>the edge of the trees,  they set off  across  the  open  as  quickly as they 
line 11475=>could. 
line 11476=>     At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of  the wood. Far back  
line 11477=>behind them stood the  high place  where  they had  breakfasted.  Frodo half 
line 11478=>expected to see the small distant  figure of  a horseman on  the ridge  dark 
line 11479=>against  the sky; but there was  no sign of  one. The  sun escaping from the 
line 11480=>breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining 
line 11481=>
line 11482=>####-brightly again. Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the 
line 11483=>land  became  steadily  more  tame and  well-ordered.  Soon they  came  into  
line 11484=>well-tended fields and meadows: there were  hedges  and gates  and dikes for 
line 11485=>drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an  ordinary corner  of 
line 11486=>the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The  line  of  the River grew 
line 11487=>nearer; and the Black Riders began  to seem  like phantoms of  the woods now 
line 11488=>left far behind. 
line 11489=>     They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and  came to a stout 
line 11490=>gate.  Beyond it a  rutted  lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards  a  
line 11491=>distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped. 
line 11492=>     'I know these fields and this gate!' he said. 'This is Bamfurlong,  old 
line 11493=>Farmer Maggot's land. That's his farm away there in the trees.' 
line 11494=>     'One trouble after  another!' said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed 
line 11495=>as if Pippin  had declared the lane was the slot leading to  a dragon's den. 
line 11496=>The others looked at him in surprise. 
line 11497=>     'What's wrong with  old Maggot?' asked Pippin.  'He's a good  friend to 
line 11498=>all the  Brandy  bucks.  Of course he's  a terror to trespassers, and  keeps 
line 11499=>ferocious  dogs  - but after all, folk down here are near the border and have 
line 11500=>to be more on their guard.' 
line 11501=>     'I  know,' said  Frodo. 'But all the same,' he added with  a shamefaced 
line 11502=>laugh,  'I am  terrified of  him and his dogs. I have avoided  his  farm for  
line 11503=>years and  years. He  caught me  several times trespassing after  mushrooms,  
line 11504=>when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall. On the last occasion he beat  me, and 
line 11505=>then took  me  and showed  me to his dogs. "See, lads," he  said, "next time 
line 11506=>this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat  him. Now see him off!" 
line 11507=>They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the  fright  - 
line 11508=>though I  daresay  the beasts knew their business and  would not really have 
line 11509=>touched me.' 
line 11510=>     Pippin laughed. 'Well, it's time you  made it up. Especially if you are 
line 11511=>coming back to live  in Buckland. Old Maggot is really  a stout fellow -  if 
line 11512=>you leave his mushrooms alone. Let's get into the lane and then we shan't be 
line 11513=>trespassing. If we meet him, I'll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry's,  
line 11514=>and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.' 
line 11515=>     They went along the lane, until they saw the  thatched roofs of a large 
line 11516=>house and farm-buildings peeping ou t among the trees ahead. The Maggots, 
line 11517=>and 
line 11518=>the Puddifoots of  Stock, and most of  the  inhabitants of  the Marish, were 
line 11519=>
line 11520=>####-house-dwellers; and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall 
line 11521=>all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the  wall into the  
line 11522=>lane. 
line 11523=>     Suddenly  as they drew nearer  a terrific baying and barking broke out, 
line 11524=>and a loud voice was heard shouting: 'Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!' 
line 11525=>     Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked  on a few paces. The gate 
line 11526=>opened and  three  huge dogs came  pelting  out  into  the  lane, and dashed 
line 11527=>towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but 
line 11528=>Sam shrank  against the wall, while  two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him 
line 11529=>suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the 
line 11530=>three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling. 
line 11531=>     Through the gate there now appeared  a broad  thick -set  hobbit  with a  
line 11532=>round  red  face. 'Hallo! Hallo!  And who may you  be, and what  may you  be 
line 11533=>wanting?' he asked. 
line 11534=>     'Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!' said Pippin. 
line 11535=>     The farmer looked at  him closely. 'Well, if it  isn't Master Pippin   - 
line 11536=>Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!' he cried, changing from a scowl to a grin. 
line 11537=>'It's a long time since I saw you round here. It's lucky for you that I know 
line 11538=>you. I was just going out to  set my dogs  on  any strangers. There are some 
line 11539=>funny things going  on today. Of course, we do get queer folk  wandering  in  
line 11540=>these parts at times. Too near the River,' he said, shaking his  head.  'But 
line 11541=>this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes  on. He won't cross 
line 11542=>my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.' 
line 11543=>     'What fellow do you mean?' asked Pippin. 
line 11544=>     'Then you haven't  seen him?' said  the  farmer. 'H e  went up the  lane 
line 11545=>towards the  causeway not  a  long while back. He  was a funny  customer and 
line 11546=>asking funny questions. But perhaps you'll come along inside, and we'll pass 
line 11547=>the news more comfortable. I've a  drop  of good ale on tap, if you and your  
line 11548=>friends are willing, Mr. Took.' 
line 11549=>     It seemed plain that the  farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do 
line 11550=>it in his own time and  fashion, so they all accepted  the invitation. 'What 
line 11551=>about the dogs?' asked Frodo anxiously. 
line 11552=>     The farmer laughed.  'They  won't harm you - not unless I  tell 'em to. 
line 11553=>Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!' he cried. 'Heel, Wolf!'  To the relief of Frodo and 
line 11554=>Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free. 
line 11555=>     Pippin introduced  the other two to the farmer. 'Mr. Frodo Baggins,' he 
line 11556=>said.  'You may not remember him, but he used to live at Brandy Hall.' At the 
line 11557=>
line 11558=>####-name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment 
line 11559=>Frodo thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and 
line 11560=>that 
line 11561=>the dogs would be  told  to see him   off. But Farmer Maggot took him by  the 
line 11562=>arm. 
line 11563=>     'Well, if that isn't queerer than ever?'  he exclaimed. 'Mr. Baggins is 
line 11564=>it? Come inside! We must have a talk.' 
line 11565=>     They went  into the farmer's  kitchen, and sat by  the wide fire-place. 
line 11566=>Mrs. Maggot brought out  beer in  a huge jug, and filled four large mugs. It 
line 11567=>was a good brew,  and Pippin found himself more than compensated for 
line 11568=>missing 
line 11569=>the  Golden  Perch.  Sam  sipped his  beer  suspiciously.  He had a  natural 
line 11570=>mistrust of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not 
line 11571=>disposed to be quick  friends with anyone who had beaten his master, however  
line 11572=>long ago. 
line 11573=>     After  a few remarks about  the weather and the agricultural  prospects 
line 11574=>(which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down his  mug and 
line 11575=>looked 
line 11576=>at them all in turn. 
line 11577=>     'Now, Mr.  Peregrin,' he  said,  'where  might you  be coming from, and 
line 11578=>where might you be going  to?  Were you coming to visit' me? For, if so, you 
line 11579=>had gone past my gate without my seeing you.' 
line 11580=>     'Well, no, '  answered Pippin.  'To tell  you the truth, since  you have 
line 11581=>guessed  it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come  over your  
line 11582=>fields. But that was quite by accident.  We  lost our way in the woods, back  
line 11583=>near Woodhall, trying to take a short cu t to the Ferry.' 
line 11584=>     'If you were  in a hurry,  the road would have served you better,' said 
line 11585=>the farmer. 'But I wasn't worrying about  that. You have  leave to walk over  
line 11586=>my land, if you have a  mind, Mr.  Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins  - though I 
line 11587=>daresay  you  still like mushrooms.'  He laughed.  'Ah yes, I recognized the 
line 11588=>name.  I recollect  the time when young Frodo  Baggins  was one of the worst  
line 11589=>young rascals of Buckland. But it  wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of. I had 
line 11590=>just heard the name Baggins before  you  turned up.  What do you think  that 
line 11591=>funny customer asked me?' 
line 11592=>     They  waited anxiously for  him to go on. 'Well,' the farmer continued, 
line 11593=>approaching his point with slow relish, 'he came riding on a big black horse 
line 11594=>in at  the  gate, which  happened  to be open, and right up to my door.  All 
line 11595=>
line 11596=>####-black he was  himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want 
line 11597=>to be known. "Now what  in the Shire  can  he want?" I thought to myself. We 
line 11598=>don't see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anywa y I had never heard 
line 11599=>of any like this black fellow. 
line 11600=>     ' "Good-day to you!" I says,  going  out to him. "This  lane don't lead 
line 11601=>anywhere,  and wherever  you may be going, your quickest way will be back to 
line 11602=>the road." I didn't like the looks of  him; and when  Grip came out, he took  
line 11603=>one sniff and  let out a  yelp as if he had been slung: he put down his tail 
line 11604=>and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still. 
line 11605=>     ' "I come  from yonder," he  said,  slow  and stiff-like, pointing back  
line 11606=>west, over my  fields, if you please.  "Have you seen Baggins?" he asked in a  
line 11607=>queer voice,  and bent  down towards  me. I could not see any face,  for his 
line 11608=>hood fell down so low; and I felt a sort of shiver down  my back. But  I did 
line 11609=>not see why he should come riding over my land so bold. 
line 11610=>     ' "Be off!" I said. "There are no Bagginses  here.  You're in the wrong 
line 11611=>part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton  - but you can  go 
line 11612=>by road this time." 
line 11613=>     ' "Baggins has  left,"  he answered in a whisper. "He is coming. He  is 
line 11614=>not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come 
line 11615=>back with gold." 
line 11616=>     ' "No you won't," I said.  "You'll  go back  where you  belong,  double 
line 11617=>quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs." 
line 11618=>     'He gave a sort  of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. 
line 11619=>Then he spurred  his great  horse right  at me, and I jumped  out of the way 
line 11620=>only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the 
line 11621=>gate  and up the lane  towards the causeway like a bolt  of thunder. What do  
line 11622=>you think of that?' 
line 11623=>     Frodo sat for a moment looking at  the fire,  but  his only thought was 
line 11624=>how on earth would they  reach the Ferry. 'I don't  know what  to think,' he 
line 11625=>said at last. 
line 11626=>     'Then I'll tell you what to think,' said Maggot. 'You should never have 
line 11627=>gone  mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo.  Folk  are queer  up 
line 11628=>there.'  Sam  stirred in  his  chair,  and  looked  at  the  farmer  with an 
line 11629=>unfriendly  eye. 'But you were always a  reckless lad. When  I heard you had 
line 11630=>left the Brandybucks  and  gone  off  to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you  
line 11631=>were going to find trouble. Mark my words, this  all comes of those  strange 
line 11632=>doings of Mr. Bilbo's. His money was got in some strange fashion  in foreign 
line 11633=>
line 11634=>####-parts, they  say. Maybe there is some that want  to know what has  become of 
line 11635=>the gold and jewels that he buried in the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?' 
line 11636=>     Frodo said  nothing:  the  shrewd  guesses of  the farmer  were  rather  
line 11637=>disconcerting. 
line 11638=>     'Well, Mr. Frodo,' Maggot went  on, 'I'm glad that you've had the sense 
line 11639=>to come back to Buckland. My  advice is: stay  there! And don't get mixed up 
line 11640=>with these outlandish folk.  You'll have  friends  in these parts. If any of 
line 11641=>these black  fellows come after you  again,  I'll  deal with  them. I'll say 
line 11642=>you're dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be 
line 11643=>true enough; for as like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.' 
line 11644=>     'Maybe you're right,' said Frodo, avoiding the farmer's eye and staring 
line 11645=>at the fire. 
line 11646=>     Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. 'Well, I see  you have ideas of your 
line 11647=>own,' he said. 'It is as plain as my  nose that no  accident brought you and 
line 11648=>that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my  news was no  great news 
line 11649=>to you, after all.  I am not asking you to tell me anything you  have a mind 
line 11650=>to keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind  of trouble. Perhaps you  
line 11651=>are thinking it won't be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?' 
line 11652=>     'I was thinking so,' said Frodo. 'But we have got to try and get there; 
line 11653=>and  it won't  be  done by sitting  and thinking. So I am afraid we must  be 
line 11654=>going.  Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I've been in terror of 
line 11655=>you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh 
line 11656=>to hear it. It's a pity: for I've missed a good friend. And now I'm sorry to 
line 11657=>leave so soon. But I'll come back, perhaps, one day  - if I get a chance.' 
line 11658=>     'You'll be welcome when you come,' said Maggot. 'But now I've a notion. 
line 11659=>It's near  sundown  already,  and we are going to  have our  supper; for  we 
line 11660=>mostly go to bed  soon after the Sun. If you and Mr. Peregrin and  all could 
line 11661=>stay and have a bite with us, we would be pleased!' 
line 11662=>     'And so should we!' said  Frodo. 'But  we  must  be going at once,  I'm 
line 11663=>afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the Ferry.' 
line 11664=>     'Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I'll 
line 11665=>gel out a small waggon,  and I'll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save 
line 11666=>you a good step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.' 
line 11667=>     Frodo  now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief  of Pippin 
line 11668=>and  Sam. The sun  was  already behind the  western hills, and the light was 
line 11669=>failing.  Two  of  Maggot's  sons  and his  three  daughters came in, and  a  
line 11670=>generous  supper was  laid  on the large table.  The kitchen  was  lit  with 
line 11671=>
line 11672=>####-candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot  hustled in and out. One or two 
line 11673=>other  hobbits  belonging to the farm-household came in.  In  a short  while 
line 11674=>fourteen  sat  down to eat. There  was beer in plenty,  and a mighty dish of 
line 11675=>mushrooms  and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The  dogs lay 
line 11676=>by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked bones. 
line 11677=>     When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern 
line 11678=>and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. 
line 11679=>They  threw their  packs  on board  and  climbed in. The farmer sat  in  the 
line 11680=>driving-seat,  and whipped up his two stout  ponies. His  wife stood  in the 
line 11681=>light of the open door. 
line 11682=>     'You  be  careful  of yourself. Maggot!' she called. 'Don't  go arguing 
line 11683=>with any foreigners, and come straight back!' 
line 11684=>     'I will!' said he, and drove out  of the gate. There was  now no breath 
line 11685=>of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. 
line 11686=>They went without  lights and took it  slowly. After  a mile or two the lane 
line 11687=>came to an end, crossing a deep dike,  and climbing a short slope up  on  to 
line 11688=>the high-banked causeway. 
line 11689=>     Maggot got down and took a good look  either way, north and  south, but 
line 11690=>nothing could  be  seen  in the darkness, and  there was not a sound in  the 
line 11691=>still  air.  Thin  strands  of river -mist  were hanging above the dikes, and 
line 11692=>crawling over the fields.  
line 11693=>     'It's going  to be thick,' said Maggot; 'but  I'll not light my lantern 
line 11694=>till I turn for home. We'll hear anything on the road long before we meet it 
line 11695=>tonight.' 
line 11696=>     It was five miles or more from Maggot's lane to the Ferry. The  hobbits 
line 11697=>wrapped themselves  up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the 
line 11698=>creak  of  the wheels and the  slow clop of  the ponies' hoofs.  The  waggon 
line 11699=>seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him  Pippin was  nodding towards 
line 11700=>sleep; but Sam was staring forwards into the rising fog. 
line 11701=>     They reached the  entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked  by 
line 11702=>two tall white posts  that suddenly loomed up  on their right. Farmer Maggot 
line 11703=>drew  in his  ponies  and the  waggon creaked  to a  halt.  They  were  just 
line 11704=>beginning  lo scramble out, when suddenly they heard what  they had all been 
line 11705=>dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them. 
line 11706=>     Maggot  jumped  down  and stood holding the  ponies' heads, and peering 
line 11707=>forward into the gloom. Clip-clop, clip-clop came the approaching rider. The 
line 11708=>fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air. 
line 11709=>
line 11710=>####-     'You'd better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,' said  Sam anxiously. 'You get down 
line 11711=>in the waggon and cover up with  blankets, and we'll send this  rider to the 
line 11712=>rightabouts!'  He climbed out  and went to the  farmer's side.  Black Riders 
line 11713=>would have to ride over him to get near the waggon. 
line 11714=>     Clop-clop, clop-clop. The rider was nearly on them. 
line 11715=>     'Hallo there!' called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short.  
line 11716=>They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard 
line 11717=>or two ahead. 'Now then!'  said the  farmer, throwing the  reins to  Sam and 
line 11718=>striding forward. 'Don't you come a step nearer! What do you want, and where 
line 11719=>are you going?' 
line 11720=>     'I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?' sa id a muffled voice - but the 
line 11721=>voice was  the voice of Merry Brandybuck.  A dark lantern was uncovered, and 
line 11722=>its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer. 
line 11723=>     'Mr. Merry!' he cried. 
line 11724=>     'Yes, of course! Who  did you think it was?' said Merry coming forward.  
line 11725=>As  he came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly  to 
line 11726=>diminish to  ordinary  hobbit-size. He was  riding a pony, and a  scarf  was 
line 11727=>swathed round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog. 
line 11728=>     Frodo  sprang  out of  the waggon to greet  him. 'So  there you are  at 
line 11729=>last!'  said Merry.  'I was beginning to wonder if you would  turn up at all 
line 11730=>today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across 
line 11731=>and rode up  towards Stock to see if you had fallen in  any ditches. But I'm 
line 11732=>blest  if  I  know  which way  you  have come. Where did you  find them, Mr. 
line 11733=>Maggot? In your duck-pond?' 
line 11734=>     'No,  I  caught 'em trespassing,'  said the farmer, 'and nearly set  my 
line 11735=>dogs on  'em;  but they'll tell  you all the story,  I 've no doubt.  Now, if 
line 11736=>you'll excuse  me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and  all, I'd best be turning for  
line 11737=>home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick.' 
line 11738=>     He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. 'Well, good  night to 
line 11739=>you all,' he said. 'It's been a queer day, and no mistake. But all's well as 
line 11740=>ends well; though perhaps  we should not say  that  until  we reach  our own 
line 11741=>doors. I'll not deny that I'll be glad now when I  do.' He lit his lanterns,  
line 11742=>and got up.  Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat.  'I was 
line 11743=>nearly forgetting,' he said. 'Mrs. Maggot put this up  for Mr. Baggins, with 
line 11744=>her compliments.'  He handed  it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of 
line 11745=>thanks and good-nights. 
line 11746=>     They  watched  the  pale  rings  of  light  round his lanterns as  they 
line 11747=>
line 11748=>####-dwindled  into  the  foggy night. Suddenly  Frodo laughed: from the  covered 
line 11749=>basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising. 
line 11750=> 
line 11751=>
line 11752=>####- 
line 11753=>
line 11754=>Chapter 5. A Conspiracy Unmasked 
line 11755=>
line 11756=> 
line 11757=> 
line 11758=>     'Now we had  better get home  ourselves,' said  Merry. There's something 
line 11759=>funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.' 
line 11760=>     They turned down  the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept  and  
line 11761=>edged with  large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards  or so  it brought  
line 11762=>them to  the  river -bank,  where there was a broad wooden  landing-stage.  A 
line 11763=>large  flat  ferry-boat was  moored beside it.  The white  bollards near the 
line 11764=>water's edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind  them 
line 11765=>the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before 
line 11766=>them was dark,  with only  a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by 
line 11767=>the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side. 
line 11768=>     Merry  led the pony  over a gangway  on to  the ferry,  and the  others 
line 11769=>followed.  Merry  then  pushed slowly off with  a  long pole. The Brandywine 
line 11770=>flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and 
line 11771=>up it a  winding path climbed from the further landing. Lamps were twinkling 
line 11772=>there. Behind loomed  up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds 
line 11773=>of mist, shone many  round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows 
line 11774=>of 
line 11775=>Brandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandybucks.  
line 11776=>     Long  ago Gorhendad Oldbuck,  head of the  Oldbuck family,  one of  the 
line 11777=>oldest  in  the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed  the river, which 
line 11778=>was the original  boundary of  the land  eastwards. He built (and excavated)  
line 11779=>Brandy  Hall, changed his name to Brandybuck,  and settled  down  to  become 
line 11780=>master of  what was virtually  a small independent country. His  family grew 
line 11781=>and grew,  and after his days  continued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied 
line 11782=>the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors,  
line 11783=>and about a hundred windows. The  Brandybucks and  their numerous 
line 11784=>dependants 
line 11785=>then  began  to burrow, and later to  build,  all round about. That was  the 
line 11786=>origin  of Buckland, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old 
line 11787=>Forest, a sort  of colony from the Shire. Its  chief village was Bucklebury, 
line 11788=>clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall. 
line 11789=>     The people in the Marish were  friendly with the Bucklanders,  and  the 
line 11790=>authority of the Master  of the  Hall (as the head of the Brandybuck  family 
line 11791=>
line 11792=>####-was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock  and Rushey. 
line 11793=>But  most of the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, 
line 11794=>half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter  of fact, they were not very 
line 11795=>different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: 
line 11796=>they were fond of boats, and some of them could swim. 
line 11797=>     Their land  was originally unprotected from the East; but on  that side 
line 11798=>they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been  planted many  generations 
line 11799=>ago, and was now thick and  tail, for it  was constantly tended. It  ran all 
line 11800=>the  way from Brandywine Bridge, in a big loop  curving away from the river, 
line 11801=>to  Haysend  (where  the  Withywindle flowed  out  of  the Forest  into  the 
line 11802=>Brandywine): well over twenty miles from end to  end. But, of course,  it was 
line 11803=>not  a complete  protection.  The Forest  drew  close  to the hedge in  many 
line 11804=>places.  The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after  dark,  and that also 
line 11805=>was not usual in the Shire. 
line 11806=>     The  ferry-boat moved slowly  across the water. The Buckland shore drew 
line 11807=>nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had not been over the river  
line 11808=>before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his 
line 11809=>old life lay behind  in the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched 
line 11810=>his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have gone 
line 11811=>on living quietly at Bag End. 
line 11812=>     The four  hobbits stepped off the ferry.  Merry was  tying  it up,  and 
line 11813=>Pippin  was already leading  the pony up the  path, when Sam  (who had  been 
line 11814=>looking ba ck, as if to take farewell of the Shire) said in a hoarse whisper: 
line 11815=>     'Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?' 
line 11816=>     On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just  make  out a  
line 11817=>figure: it looked like a  dark black bundle left behind. But a s they  looked 
line 11818=>it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It  
line 11819=>then crawled, or went crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.  
line 11820=>     'What in the Shire is that?' exclaimed Merry. 
line 11821=>     'Something that is following us,' said Frodo. 'But don't ask  any  more 
line 11822=>now!  Let's get away  at once!' They hurried up the path to the top  of  the 
line 11823=>bank,  but when  they  looked  back  the far shore was shrouded in mist, and 
line 11824=>nothing could be seen. 
line 11825=>     'Thank goodness you don't keep any boats on the west -bank!' said Frodo.  
line 11826=>'Can horses cross the river?' 
line 11827=>     'They  can go twenty miles north to Brandywine  Bridge - or they  might 
line 11828=>swim,'  answered  Merry. 'Though  I  never heard of any horse  swimming  the 
line 11829=>
line 11830=>####-Brandywine. But what have  horses to do with it?' I'll tell you later. Let's 
line 11831=>get indoors and then we can talk.' 
line 11832=>     'All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I'll just ride on and tell 
line 11833=>Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We'll see about supper and things.' 
line 11834=>     'We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,' said Frodo;  'but we could 
line 11835=>do with another.' 
line 11836=>     'You shall have it! Give  me that basket!' said  Merry, and  rode ahead 
line 11837=>into the darkness.  
line 11838=>     It  was some distance from  the  Brandywine  to  Frodo's new  house  at 
line 11839=>Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their left, and on the 
line 11840=>outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from 
line 11841=>the Bridge. Half a mile northward  along this they came to a lane opening on  
line 11842=>their  right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it  climbed up and 
line 11843=>down into the country. 
line 11844=>     At last  they  came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be 
line 11845=>seen  of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of 
line 11846=>a wide  circle of  lawn surrounded by  a belt of  low trees inside the outer  
line 11847=>hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an  out-of-the-way corner of 
line 11848=>the country, and there were  no other dwellings close  by.  You could get in 
line 11849=>and out  without being noticed. It had been built a long while before by the 
line 11850=>Brandybucks, for the use  of guests, or members of the family that wished to 
line 11851=>escape  from  the  crowded  life  of  Brandy  Hall  for a  time.  It  was an 
line 11852=>old-fashioned  countrified house, as much like a hobbit -hole as possible: it 
line 11853=>was long and low,  with no  upper storey; and it had a roof  of  turf, round 
line 11854=>windows, and a large round door. 
line 11855=>     As they walked lip the green path  from  the gate no light was visible; 
line 11856=>the  windows  were dark and shuttered.  Frodo knocked on the door, and Fatty 
line 11857=>Bolger opened it . A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and 
line 11858=>shut themselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on 
line 11859=>either side; in  front  of them a  passage ran back  down the  middle of the 
line 11860=>house. 
line 11861=>     'Well, what do you think of it?' asked Merry coming up the passage. 'We 
line 11862=>have  done our  best in  a short time to make it  look  like home. After all 
line 11863=>Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.' 
line 11864=>     Frodo looked  round.  It did  look like home. Many of his own favourite 
line 11865=>things -  or Bilbo's things (they  reminded  him sharply of him in their new 
line 11866=>selling) - were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been  at Bag End. 
line 11867=>
line 11868=>####-It  was  a  pleasant,  comfortable,  welcoming  place;  and he found himself 
line 11869=>wishing  that he was really coming  here to settle down in quiet retirement. 
line 11870=>It  seemed unfair  to have put his friends  to  all  this  trouble;  and  he 
line 11871=>wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave 
line 11872=>them so soon, indeed at  once. Yet that  would  have  to be  done  that very 
line 11873=>night, before they all went to bed. 
line 11874=>     'It's delightful!' he said with an effort. 'I  hardly feel that I  have 
line 11875=>moved at all.' 
line 11876=>     The  travellers hung  up their  cloaks,  and piled  their packs  on the 
line 11877=>floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end. 
line 11878=>Firelight came out, and a puff of steam. 
line 11879=>     'A bath!' cried Pippin. 'O blessed Meriadoc!' 
line 11880=>     'Which order  shall we  go in?' said Frodo. 'Eldest  first, or quickest 
line 11881=>first? You'll be last either way, Master Peregrin.' 
line 11882=>     'Trust me to arrange things  better than that!'  said Merry.  'We can't 
line 11883=>begin life  at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are 
line 11884=>three tubs, and  a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats 
line 11885=>and soap. Get inside, and be quick!' 
line 11886=>     Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, 
line 11887=>and  busied  themselves  with  the  final  preparations  for  a late supper. 
line 11888=>Snatches of competing songs came  from the bathroom mixed  with the sound 
line 11889=>of 
line 11890=>splashing and wallowing.  The voice of Pippin was  suddenly lifted up  above 
line 11891=>the others in one of Bilbo's favourite bath-songs. 
line 11892=>     Sing hey! for the bath at close of day 
line 11893=>     that washes the weary mud away! 
line 11894=>     A loon is he that will not sing: 
line 11895=>     O! Water Hot is a noble thing! 
line 11896=> 
line 11897=>     O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain, 
line 11898=>     and the brook that leaps from hill to plain; 
line 11899=>     but better than rain or rippling streams 
line 11900=>     is Water Hot that smokes and steams. 
line 11901=> 
line 11902=>     O! Water cold we may pour at need 
line 11903=>     down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed; 
line 11904=>     but better is Beer, if drink we lack, 
line 11905=>
line 11906=>####-     and Water Hot poured down the back. 
line 11907=> 
line 11908=>     O! Water is fair that leaps on high 
line 11909=>     in a fountain white beneath the sky; 
line 11910=>     but never did fountain sound so sweet 
line 11911=>     as splashing Hot Water with my feet! 
line 11912=>     There  was a terrific  splash, and  a  shout  of  Whoa! from  Frodo. It 
line 11913=>appeared that a lot of Pippin's  bath had imitated a fountain and leaped  on 
line 11914=>high. 
line 11915=>     Merry went  to the door: 'What about supper a nd beer in the throat?' he 
line 11916=>called. Frodo came out drying his hair. 
line 11917=>     'There's so much  water  in the air that I'm coming into the kitchen to 
line 11918=>finish,' he said. 
line 11919=>     'Lawks!' said Merry, looking  in. The  stone floor  was swimming.  'You  
line 11920=>ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. Peregrin,' he said. 
line 11921=>'Hurry up, or we shan't wait for you.' 
line 11922=>     They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. 'I suppose you  
line 11923=>three won't want mushrooms again?' said Fredegar without much hope. 
line 11924=>     'Yes we shall!' cried Pippin. 
line 11925=>     'They're mine!'  said Frodo. 'Given to me  by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among 
line 11926=>farmers' wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I'll serve them.' 
line 11927=>     Hobbits have a passion  for mushrooms,  surpassing  even  the greediest  
line 11928=>likings  of Big  People.  A  fact  which  partly explains young Frodo's long 
line 11929=>expeditions  to  the renowned fields of the Marish,  and the  wrath  of  the 
line 11930=>injured Maggot. On this occasion there was plenty for all, even according to 
line 11931=>hobbit standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they 
line 11932=>had  finished even Fatty Bolger heaved  a sigh  of content. They pushed back 
line 11933=>the table, and drew chairs round the fire. 
line 11934=>     'We'll clear up later,' said Merry. 'Now tell me all  about it! I guess 
line 11935=>that you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I 
line 11936=>want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with 
line 11937=>old Maggot, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was 
line 11938=>scared, if that is possible.' 
line 11939=>     'We  have all been  scared,' said Pippin after a pause,  in which Frodo 
line 11940=>stared at the fire and did not speak. 'You would have been,  too, if you had 
line 11941=>been chased for two days by Black Riders.' 
line 11942=>     'And what are they?' 
line 11943=>
line 11944=>####-     'Black figures  riding  on black horses,'  answered Pippin.  'If  Frodo 
line 11945=>won't talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.' He then gave 
line 11946=>a  full account of their journey from the time  when they left Hobbiton. Sam 
line 11947=>gave various supporting nods and exclamations. Frodo remained silent. 
line 11948=>     'I should  think you were making it all up,'  said Merry, 'if I had not 
line 11949=>seen  that black shape on  the landing-stage - and heard the queer  sound in 
line 11950=>Maggot's voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?' 
line 11951=>     'Cousin Frodo has been very close,' said Pippin. 'But the time has come 
line 11952=>for  him to open  out. So far we have been given nothing  more to go on than 
line 11953=>Farmer  Maggot's  guess  that  it  has  something  to  do  with  old Bilbo's 
line 11954=>treasure.' 
line 11955=>     'That  was  only  a  guess,' said Frodo hastily. 'Maggot does  not know 
line 11956=>anything.' 
line 11957=>     'Old Maggot is  a shrewd fellow,' said Merry. 'A lot goes on behind his 
line 11958=>round face that does not come out in his talk. I've heard that he used to go 
line 11959=>into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good 
line 11960=>many  strange things. But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think  
line 11961=>his guess good or bad.' 
line 11962=>     'I think,'  answered Frodo slowly, 'that it was a good guess, as  far as 
line 11963=>it  goes. There is a  connexion with Bilbo's  old adventures,  and the Riders 
line 11964=>are looking,  or perhaps one  ought to say  searching,  for him or for me. I 
line 11965=>also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not 
line 11966=>safe here or anywhere else.' He looked round at the windows and walls, as if 
line 11967=>he was afraid  they would  su ddenly give  way.  The others looked at him  in 
line 11968=>silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves. 
line 11969=>     'It's coming out in a minute,' whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded. 
line 11970=>     'Well!' said Frodo at  last, sitting  up and straightening his back, as 
line 11971=>if he had made  a  decision.  'I can't keep it dark any  longer.  I have got 
line 11972=>something to tell you all. But I don't know quite how to begin.' 
line 11973=>     'I think I could help you,' said Merry quietly, 'by telling you some of 
line 11974=>it myself.' 
line 11975=>     'What do you mean?' said  Frodo, looking  at him anxiously. 'Just this, 
line 11976=>my  dear old  Frodo: you  are miserable, because you don't know how  to  say 
line 11977=>good-bye.  You  meant to leave the Shire, of course. But danger has come  on 
line 11978=>you sooner  than you expected, and now you are  making up your mind to go at 
line 11979=>once. And you don't want to. We are very sorry for you.' 
line 11980=>     Frodo opened his mouth  and shut it again. His  look of surprise was so 
line 11981=>
line 11982=>####-comical that they laughed. 'Dear  old  Frodo!' said Pippin.  'Did you really 
line 11983=>think you had thrown dust in  all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful 
line 11984=>or clever enough for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying 
line 11985=>farewell  to  all your haunts all this  year since April. We have constantly 
line 11986=>heard you  muttering:  "Shall  I  ever   look  down into that valley again, I 
line 11987=>wonder",  and things like that.  And pretending that you had come to the end  
line 11988=>of  your  money,  and  actually  selling  your  beloved  Bag  End  to  those 
line 11989=>Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close talks with Gandalf.' 
line 11990=>     'Good  heavens!'  said Frodo. 'I thought  I had been  both  careful and 
line 11991=>clever. I don't know what Gandalf would say. Is all  the Shire discussing my  
line 11992=>departure then?' 
line 11993=>     'Oh no!' said Merry. 'Don't worry about that! The secret won't keep for  
line 11994=>long,  of  course;  but  at  present it  is,  I  think,  only  known  to  us 
line 11995=>conspirators. After  all, you must remember  that we know you  well, and are 
line 11996=>often with  you.  We can usually guess what you are thinking. I  knew Bilbo,  
line 11997=>too. To  tell you the truth,  I had been watching you  rather  closely  ever  
line 11998=>since he  left. I thought you would go  after him sooner or  later; indeed I 
line 11999=>expected you  to go sooner, and lately we have  been very  anxious.  We have 
line 12000=>been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly,  all on 
line 12001=>your own like he did. Ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open, and  
line 12002=>done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape 
line 12003=>so easily!' 
line 12004=>     'But I must go,' said Frodo. 'It cannot be helped, dear friends. It  is 
line 12005=>wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Since you have 
line 12006=>guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!' 
line 12007=>     'You  do not understand!' said Pippin. 'You  must go  - and therefore we 
line 12008=>must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an excellent fellow,  and 
line 12009=>would jump down a dragon's throat to  save you, if he did not trip over  his 
line 12010=>own feet; but  you  will  need  more than one  companion in  your  dangerous 
line 12011=>adventure.' 
line 12012=>     'My dear  and  most beloved hobbits!'  said Frodo deeply  moved. 'But I 
line 12013=>could not  allow it. I decided that  long ago, too. You speak of danger, but 
line 12014=>you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt,  no there-and -back journey.  
line 12015=>I am flying from deadly peril into deadly peril.' 
line 12016=>     'Of course  we understand,'  said Merry  firmly.  'That is why we  have 
line 12017=>decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing-matter; but we are going to 
line 12018=>do our best to help you against the Enemy.' 
line 12019=>
line 12020=>####-     'The Ring!' said Frodo, now completely amazed. 
line 12021=>     'Yes, the Ring,' said  Merry. 'My dear old hobbit, you don't  allow for  
line 12022=>the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring 
line 12023=>for years  - before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded 
line 12024=>it  as  secret,  I  kept  the  knowledge  in  my  head, until we formed  our 
line 12025=>conspiracy. I  did not know Bilbo, of course, as  well as I know you; I  was 
line 12026=>too young, and he was also more careful  - but  he was not careful enough. If 
line 12027=>you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.' 
line 12028=>     'Go on!' said Frodo faintly. 
line 12029=>     'It was  the  Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall,  as you might 
line 12030=>expect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened to be walking along the  
line 12031=>road, when I  saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared, 
line 12032=>coming towards us.  Bilbo slowed down, and then hey presto! he  vanished.  I 
line 12033=>was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary 
line 12034=>fashion; but  I got through the hedge and walked along the  field inside.  I 
line 12035=>was  peeping  through into the road,  after the S.-B.s  had  passed, and was 
line 12036=>looking  straight at Bilbo  when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of 
line 12037=>gold as he put something back in his trouser -pocket. 
line 12038=>     'After that I kept my  eyes open.  In fact, I confess that I spied. But 
line 12039=>you must  admit that it was very  intriguing, and I was only in my teens.  I 
line 12040=>must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the 
line 12041=>old fellow's secret book.' 
line 12042=>     'You have read his book!' cried Frodo.  'Good heavens above! Is nothing 
line 12043=>safe?' 
line 12044=>     'Not  too safe, I should say,' said  Merry.  'But  I have  only had one 
line 12045=>rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I 
line 12046=>wonder what became  of it. I should  like  another look.  Have you  got  it, 
line 12047=>Frodo?' 
line 12048=>     'No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.' 
line 12049=>     'Well, as  I  was saying,' Merry  proceeded, 'I  kept my  knowledge  to 
line 12050=>myself,  till  this Spring  when  things got  serious. Then  we  formed  our 
line 12051=>conspiracy;  and  as we were serious, too,  and meant business,  we have not  
line 12052=>been too scrupulous. You are  not a very easy  nut to crack,  and Gandalf is 
line 12053=>worse. But if  you want to be  introduced  to our chief investigator, I  can 
line 12054=>produce him.' 
line 12055=>     'Where is  he?' said  Frodo, looking round, as if he  expected a masked 
line 12056=>and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard. 
line 12057=>
line 12058=>####-     'Step forward, Sam!'  said Merry; and  Sam stood up with a face scarlet 
line 12059=>up to  the ears.  'Here's our collector of  information! And he  collected a  
line 12060=>lot, I  can tell you, before he was finally  caught. After which, I may say, 
line 12061=>he seemed to regard himself as on parole, and dried up.' 
line 12062=>     'Sam!' cried  Frodo,  feeling that amazement could  go no  further, and 
line 12063=>quite  unable  to decide whether he felt angry,  amused, relieved, or merely 
line 12064=>foolish. 
line 12065=>     'Yes, sir!' said Sam.  'Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant  no wrong 
line 12066=>to you, Mr.  Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf  for that matter. He  has some sense, 
line 12067=>mind you; and when you  said  go alone, he  said no! lake someone as you can 
line 12068=>trust.' 
line 12069=>     'But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,' said Frodo.  Sam looked 
line 12070=>at him unhappily.  'It all depends on what you want,' put in Merry. 'You can 
line 12071=>trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you  
line 12072=>can trust us to keep any secret of yours  - closer than you keep it yourself.  
line 12073=>But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off  without a  
line 12074=>word. We  are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what 
line 12075=>Gandalf has  told you. We know  a good deal about the Ring. We  are horribly 
line 12076=>afraid - but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.' 
line 12077=>     'And after all, sir,'  added Sam,  'you did  ought to  take the  Elves' 
line 12078=>advice.  Gildor said you should take them as was willing, and you can't deny 
line 12079=>it.' 
line 12080=>     'I don't deny it,' said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. 'I 
line 12081=>don't  deny it, but I'll never believe you  are  sleeping again, whether you  
line 12082=>snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure. 
line 12083=>     'You are a set  of deceitful  scoundrels!'  he  said,  turning  to  the 
line 12084=>others.  'But bless you!' he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, 'I give 
line 12085=>in. I will take Gildor's  advice.  If the danger were not  so dark, I should 
line 12086=>dance for joy. Even so,  I cannot  help feeling  happy; happier than I  have 
line 12087=>felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.' 
line 12088=>     'Good!  That's  settled. Three cheers  for  Captain Frodo and company!' 
line 12089=>they shouted;  and  they  danced round him. Merry and  Pippin  began a song, 
line 12090=>which they had apparently got ready for the occasion. 
line 12091=>     It was made on  the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo  on  his 
line 12092=>adventure long ago, and went to the same tune: 
line 12093=>     Farewell we call to hearth and hall! 
line 12094=>     Though wind may blow and rain may fall, 
line 12095=>
line 12096=>####-     We must away ere break of day 
line 12097=>     Far over wood and mountain tall. 
line 12098=> 
line 12099=>     To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell 
line 12100=>     In glades beneath the misty fell, 
line 12101=>     Through moor and waste we ride in haste, 
line 12102=>     And whither then we cannot tell. 
line 12103=> 
line 12104=>     With foes ahead, behind us dread, 
line 12105=>     Beneath the sky shall be our bed, 
line 12106=>     Until at last our toil be passed, 
line 12107=>     Our journey done, our errand sped. 
line 12108=> 
line 12109=>     We must away! We must away! 
line 12110=>     We ride before the break of day! 
line 12111=>     'Very good!' said Frodo. 'But in that case there are a lot of things to 
line 12112=>do before we go to bed - under a roof, for  tonight at any rate.' 
line 12113=>     'Oh! That was poetry!' said Pippin. 'Do you really mean to start before 
line 12114=>the break of day?' 
line 12115=>     'I don't know,' answered  Frodo. 'I fear those  Black Riders, and  I am 
line 12116=>sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially in  a place to which 
line 12117=>it is known  I was going. Also Gildor advised me  not to wait. But I  should 
line 12118=>very  much like  to see  Gandalf. I could see that even Gildor was disturbed 
line 12119=>when  he heard that Gandalf  had never  appeared. It really  depends  on two 
line 12120=>things.  How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how  soon could 
line 12121=>we 
line 12122=>get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.' 
line 12123=>     'The answer to the  second question,' said Merry, 'is that we could get 
line 12124=>off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything. There are six ponies 
line 12125=>in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except  for  
line 12126=>a few extra clothes, and the perishable food.' 
line 12127=>     'It seems to have been  a  very efficient conspiracy,' said Frodo. 'But 
line 12128=>what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait one day for Gandalf?' 
line 12129=>     'That all depends on  what you think the Riders would do, if they found 
line 12130=>you here,' answered Merry. 'They could  have reached here  by now, of course, 
line 12131=>if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the 
line 12132=>river -bank, just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them 
line 12133=>
line 12134=>####-through by night, though they might break through. Even in the daylight they 
line 12135=>would try  to keep them out, I think, at any  rate until  they got a message 
line 12136=>through to the Master of the Hall  - for they would not like the  look of the 
line 12137=>Riders, and would certainly be  frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland 
line 12138=>cannot resist a determined attack for  long. And it  is possible that in the 
line 12139=>morning even a Black Rider that rode  up  and asked for Mr. Baggins would be 
line 12140=>let through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back  to  live 
line 12141=>at Crickhollow.' 
line 12142=>     Frodo  sat for  a while in thought. 'I have made  up  my mind,' he said 
line 12143=>finally. 'I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light. But I am not going 
line 12144=>by road: it  would be safer  to  wait here than  that.  If  I go through the 
line 12145=>North-gate my departure from  Buckland  will  be  known at once, instead  of 
line 12146=>being secret for  several days at least,  as it might be. And  what is more, 
line 12147=>the Bridge and the  East Road  near the  borders  will certainly be watched, 
line 12148=>whether  any Rider gets into  Buckland or not. We don't know  how many there 
line 12149=>are; but there are at least  two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is 
line 12150=>to go off in a qu ite unexpected direction.' 
line 12151=>     'But that  can only mean going  into  the  Old  Forest!'  said Fredegar 
line 12152=>horrified. 'You can't be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as 
line 12153=>Black Riders.' 
line 12154=>     'Not quite,' said Merry. It sounds very  desperate, but I believe Frodo 
line 12155=>is right. It is the only way of getting off without being followed  at once. 
line 12156=>With luck we might gel a considerable start.' 
line 12157=>     'But you won't have any luck in the Old Forest,' objected Fredegar. 'No 
line 12158=>one ever has luck in there. You'll gel lost. People don't go in there.' 
line 12159=>     'Oh yes they  do!'  said  Merry. 'The Brandybucks go in   - occasionally 
line 12160=>when the fit takes  them. We have  a  private entrance. Frodo  went in once, 
line 12161=>long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when 
line 12162=>the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet.' 
line 12163=>     'Well, do  as you think best!' said Fredegar. 'I am more afraid of  the 
line 12164=>Old  Forest  than of anything I  know about:  the  stories  about  it  are a  
line 12165=>nightmare; but  my  vote hardly counts,  as I am  not going on the  journey. 
line 12166=>Still, I am very glad  someone is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what 
line 12167=>you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.' 
line 12168=>     Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, 
line 12169=>nor to see what lay  outside it. His family came from the Eastfarthing, from 
line 12170=>Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine 
line 12171=>
line 12172=>####-Bridge.  His task, according to the original plans  of the conspirators, was 
line 12173=>to stay  behind and deal with inquisitive folk,  and  to keep up as long  as 
line 12174=>possible the  pretence that Mr. Baggins  was still living at Crickhollow. He 
line 12175=>had even brought along some old clothes of  Frodo's to help  him  in playing  
line 12176=>the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove. 
line 12177=>     'Excellent!' said Frodo,  when he understood the  plan. 'We  could  not  
line 12178=>have  left  any  message behind for Gandalf otherwise.  I don't know whether 
line 12179=>these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk  
line 12180=>a written message, in case they got in and  searched the house. But if Fatty 
line 12181=>is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way we 
line 12182=>have gone, that  decides me. I am going  into  the Old  Forest  first  thing 
line 12183=>tomorrow.' 
line 12184=>     'Well, that's that,' said Pippin. 'On the whole I would rather have our 
line 12185=>job than Fatty's - waiting here till Black Riders come.' 
line 12186=>     'You wait till you are well inside  the Forest,' said Fredegar. 'You'll 
line 12187=>wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.' 
line 12188=>     'It's no  good arguing about it any more,' said Merry.  'We have  still 
line 12189=>got  to tidy up and put the finishing touches to  the packing, before we get 
line 12190=>to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.' 
line 12191=>     When at last he  had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for  some  time. 
line 12192=>His  legs ached. He. was  glad that he was riding in the morning. Eventually 
line 12193=>he fell into a  vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking  out of a high 
line 12194=>window over  a dark  sea of tangled trees.  Down below among the roots there 
line 12195=>was the sound of creatures  crawling and snuffling.  He felt sure they would  
line 12196=>smell him out sooner or later. 
line 12197=>     Then  he heard a noise in the distance.  At first he thought  it  was a  
line 12198=>great wind  coming over the leaves of the forest. Then  he knew  that it was 
line 12199=>not leaves, but the sound of the  Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in 
line 12200=>waking life, though it  had often  troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he 
line 12201=>was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on  a dark heath, 
line 12202=>and there was a strange salt smell in  the air. Looking up he saw before him 
line 12203=>a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge. A great desire came over  
line 12204=>him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle  up the ridge 
line 12205=>towards the  tower:  but  suddenly a light came in  the sky, and there was a  
line 12206=>noise of thunder. 
line 12207=> 
line 12208=> 
line 12209=>
line 12210=>####-<h4>Chapter 6.</h4> <br> The Old Forest 
line 12211=>
line 12212=> 
line 12213=> 
line 12214=>     Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in  the room. Merry was standing 
line 12215=>there with a candle  in one hand, and banging  on the  door with the  other. 
line 12216=>'All right! What is it?' said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered. 
line 12217=>     'What is it!' cried Merry. 'It is  time to get up. It is half past four 
line 12218=>and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin 
line 12219=>is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be 
line 12220=>the  baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up  and  
line 12221=>see us off.' 
line 12222=>     Soon after  six o'clock the  five  hobbits were  ready  to start. Fatty 
line 12223=>Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in 
line 12224=>front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that  went through 
line 12225=>a spinney behind  the house, and then  cut across several fields. The leaves 
line 12226=>of  trees were  glistening, and every twig  was dripping; the grass was grey 
line 12227=>with  cold dew. Everything was  still,  and far-away  noises seemed near and 
line 12228=>clear:  fowls chattering  in a yard,  someone closing a  door of  a  distant 
line 12229=>house. 
line 12230=>     In their shed they found the ponies;  sturdy  little beasts of the kind 
line 12231=>loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for  a long day's work. They mounted, 
line 12232=>and  soon  they  were  riding off  into  the  mist,  which  seemed  to  open 
line 12233=>reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for  
line 12234=>about  an  hour,  slowly  and without talking,  they  saw  the Hedge looming  
line 12235=>suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over  with silver cobwebs.  'How  are 
line 12236=>you  going to get  through  this?'  asked Fredegar. 'Follow me!' said Merry, 
line 12237=>'and you will see.' He turned to the  left  along  the Hedge, and  soon they 
line 12238=>came to a point  wher e it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A 
line 12239=>cutting  had been made, at  some distance from the  Hedge, and  went sloping 
line 12240=>gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at  the sides, which rose 
line 12241=>steadily,  until suddenly  they arched  over a nd formed a  tunnel that dived 
line 12242=>deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side. 
line 12243=>     Here Fatty Bolger halted. 'Good-bye, Frodo!' he  said.  'I wish you were 
line 12244=>not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the 
line 12245=>day is out. But good luck to you - today and every day!' 
line 12246=>     'If there  are no worse things ahead  than  the Old Forest, I  shall be 
line 12247=>lucky,'  said  Frodo. 'Tell Gandalf to hurry along the  East Road: we  shall 
line 12248=>
line 12249=>####-soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.'  'Good-bye!' they cried, and 
line 12250=>rode down the slope and disappeared from Fredegar's sight into the tunnel. 
line 12251=>     It  was  dark and  damp. At the far  end it  was  closed  by  a gate of 
line 12252=>thick -set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had 
line 12253=>all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock  
line 12254=>clicked. The sound was ominous. 
line 12255=>     'There!' said Merry. 'You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and 
line 12256=>on the edge of the Old Forest.' 
line 12257=>     'Are the stories about it true?' asked Pippin. 
line 12258=>     'I don't know what  stories you mean,' Merry answered. 'If you mean the 
line 12259=>old bogey-stories Fatty's nurses  used to tell him, about goblins and wolves 
line 12260=>and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I  don't believe them. 
line 12261=>But the  Forest is queer. Everything in it  is very  much more  alive,  more 
line 12262=>aware of what is going on, so to  speak, than things  are in the  Shire. And 
line 12263=>the  trees do not like strangers. They watch  you. They  are usually content 
line 12264=>merely to  watch  you,  as  long  a s  daylight  lasts,  and  don't  do much. 
line 12265=>Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a  branch,  or  stick  a root 
line 12266=>out,  or grasp at you with a long trailer. But at  night things  can be most  
line 12267=>alarming,  or so I am  told. I have  only once or twice  been in here  after  
line 12268=>dark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the  trees were whispering 
line 12269=>to each  other,  passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; 
line 12270=>and the branches swayed and groped without any wind. They  do  say the trees 
line 12271=>do  actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In  fact long  
line 12272=>ago they  attacked the Hedge: they came and  planted themselves right by it,  
line 12273=>and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and 
line 12274=>made a great  bonfire in the  Forest, and  burned all the  ground in  a long 
line 12275=>strip east of the Hedge. After that the  trees gave up the attack,  but they 
line 12276=>became very unfriendly.  There  is  still a wide  bare  space not far inside 
line 12277=>where the bonfire was made.' 
line 12278=>     'Is it only the trees that are dangerous?' asked Pippin. 
line 12279=>     'There are  various queer things living deep  in the Forest, and on the 
line 12280=>far  side,' said Merry, 'or at least I have heard so; but I have never  seen 
line 12281=>any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever  one comes inside one 
line 12282=>finds 
line 12283=>open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time  to time in a queer 
line 12284=>fashion.  Not far from  this tunnel there is, or was for  a  long time,  the 
line 12285=>beginning of quite  a broad path leading to the Bonfire  Glade,  and then on 
line 12286=>
line 12287=>####-more  or less in our direction, east and a little  north. That is the path I 
line 12288=>am going to try and find.' 
line 12289=>     The hobbits now left the tunnel -gate and rode across  the  wide hollow.  
line 12290=>On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a  
line 12291=>hundred yards a nd more beyond  the Hedge;  but it  vanished  as  soon as  it 
line 12292=>brought them under the trees.  Looking back they could see the  dark line of 
line 12293=>the  Hedge  through  the stems of trees  that were already thick about them. 
line 12294=>Looking  ahead  they  could  see  only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes  and  
line 12295=>shapes: straight  or bent,  twisted, leaning,  squat  or slender, smooth  or  
line 12296=>gnarled and branched;  and all the stems were green  or grey with  moss  and  
line 12297=>slimy, shaggy growths.  
line 12298=>     Merry alone  seemed fairly cheerful.  'You had  better lead  on and find 
line 12299=>that path,'  Frodo  said to him.  'Don't  let us lose one another, or forget 
line 12300=>which way the Hedge lies!' 
line 12301=>     They picked a  way  among the trees, and  their  ponies plodded  along, 
line 12302=>carefully  avoiding the many  writhing  and interlacing roots. There  was no 
line 12303=>undergrowth. The ground was  rising  steadily,  and as they went  forward it  
line 12304=>seemed  that the trees became  taller, darker,  and  thicker. There  was  no 
line 12305=>sound,  except  an occasional drip  of  moisture falling  through  the still 
line 12306=>leaves.  For  the  moment  there  was no  whispering  or movement  among the 
line 12307=>branches; but  they  all got  an uncomfortable feeling that they were  being 
line 12308=>watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity.  The feeling 
line 12309=>steadily  grew, until they found  themselves looking up quickly, or glancing 
line 12310=>back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.  
line 12311=>     There was not  as  yet  any  sign  of  a path,  and  the  trees  seemed 
line 12312=>constantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly  felt that he could not bear it 
line 12313=>any longer, and without warning let out  a shout. 'Oi! Oi!' he  cried. 'I am 
line 12314=>not going to do anything. Just let me pass through, will you!' 
line 12315=>     The others halted startled; but the  cry  fell as if muffled by a heavy 
line 12316=>curtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood  seemed to  become 
line 12317=>more 
line 12318=>crowded and more watchful than before. 
line 12319=>     'I should not shout, if I were you,' said Merry. It does more harm than 
line 12320=>good.' 
line 12321=>     Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, a nd if 
line 12322=>he had been right  to make  the others come into this abominable wood. Merry 
line 12323=>was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. 
line 12324=>
line 12325=>####-Pippin noticed it. 'It  has not taken you long to lose  us,' he said. But at 
line 12326=>that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead. 
line 12327=>     'Well, well!'  he  said. 'These trees do  shift.  There is the  Bonfire 
line 12328=>Glade in front of  us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved 
line 12329=>away!' 
line 12330=>     The light grew clearer as they  went forward. Suddenly they came out of 
line 12331=>the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above 
line 12332=>them, blue and clear to  their surprise, for down under the Forest -roof they 
line 12333=>had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist. The 
line 12334=>sun  was  not,  however,  high  enough  yet to shine down into the clearing, 
line 12335=>though its light was on  the  tree-tops. The  leaves  were  all  thicker and 
line 12336=>greener about  the edges of  the  glade, enclosing  it with  an almost solid 
line 12337=>wall. No tree grew there,  only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky  and 
line 12338=>faded hemlocks  and wood-parsley,  fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes,  and 
line 12339=>rampant nettles and  thistles.  A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and 
line 12340=>cheerful garden after the close Forest. 
line 12341=>     The hobbits  felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening 
line 12342=>daylight in the  sky. At the far side  of the glade there was a break in the 
line 12343=>wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into 
line 12344=>the wood, wide  in places  and open  above, though  every  now and again the 
line 12345=>trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path  they 
line 12346=>rode. They were  still climbing gently, but they now  went much quicker, and 
line 12347=>with better heart;  for it seemed to them that the  Forest had relented, and 
line 12348=>was going to let them pass unhindered after all. 
line 12349=>     But after a while the air began to get  hot and stuffy. The  trees drew 
line 12350=>close again  on either side, and they  could  no longer  see far ahead.  Now 
line 12351=>stronger than ever they  felt again  the ill will  of  the  wood pressing on 
line 12352=>them.  So silent was it that  the fall of their ponies'  hoofs, rustling  on 
line 12353=>dead leaves and  occasionally  stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud  in 
line 12354=>their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank  
line 12355=>to a murmur. 
line 12356=>     O! Wanderers in the shadowed land 
line 12357=>     despair not! For though dark they stand, 
line 12358=>     all woods there be must end at last, 
line 12359=>     and see the open sun go past: 
line 12360=>     the setting sun, the rising sun, 
line 12361=>     the day's end, or the day begun. 
line 12362=>
line 12363=>####-     For east or west all woods must fail... 
line 12364=>     Fail - even as he said the word his voice faded  into  silence. The air 
line 12365=>seemed  heavy and the making  of  words wearisome. Just behind them  a large 
line 12366=>branch fell from an  old overhanging tree with  a crash into  the  path. The 
line 12367=>trees seemed to close in before them. 
line 12368=>     'They  do not  like all that about ending and failing,' said  Merry. 'I  
line 12369=>should not sing any  more  at present. Wait till we do  get to the edge, and 
line 12370=>then we'll turn and give them a rousing chorus!' 
line 12371=>     He spoke cheerfully, and if  he felt any great anxiety, he did not show 
line 12372=>it. The  others did not  answer.  They were depressed.  A heavy  weight  was 
line 12373=>settling steadily  on  Frodo's  heart, and he regretted now with every  step 
line 12374=>forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace  of the trees. He 
line 12375=>was, indeed,  just  about  to stop and propose going back (if that was still 
line 12376=>possible), when  things took  a  new  turn. The  path  stopped climbing, and 
line 12377=>became for a while nearly  level. The dark trees drew aside, and  ahead they 
line 12378=>could see  the path  going  almost  straight forward.  Before them, but some 
line 12379=>distance off, there stood a  green  hill-top, treeless, rising  like a  bald 
line 12380=>head out of the  encircling wood. The  path seemed to be making directly for  
line 12381=>it. 
line 12382=>     They now hurried forward again,  delighted with the thought of climbing 
line 12383=>out  for  a  while above the roof  of the Forest. The path dipped, and  then 
line 12384=>again began  to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep 
line 12385=>hillside.  There  it left the trees and faded into the turf.  The wood stood 
line 12386=>all round the hill like  thick  hair that ended sharply in  a circle round a  
line 12387=>shaven crown. 
line 12388=>     The hobbits  led their  ponies up, winding  round and  round until they 
line 12389=>reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming 
line 12390=>and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near  at 
line 12391=>hand the mist was now almost gone;  though here and there it lay  in hollows 
line 12392=>of the wood, and to  the south  of  them, out of a deep  fold cutting  right 
line 12393=>across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke. 
line 12394=>     'That,'  said Merry, pointing  with his hand, 'that  is the line of the 
line 12395=>Withywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and flows south-west through 
line 12396=>the 
line 12397=>midst of the  Forest to join the  Brandywine below Haysend. We don't want to 
line 12398=>go that way! The Withywindle valley is said to be  the  queerest part of the 
line 12399=>whole wood  - the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.' 
line 12400=>
line 12401=>####-     The others looked in the  direction  that  Merry  pointed out, but they 
line 12402=>could see little but mists over the damp and  deep-cut valley; and beyond it 
line 12403=>the southern half of the Forest faded from view.  
line 12404=>     The sun on the hill-lop was now  getting  hot. It must  have been a bout 
line 12405=>eleven o'clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in 
line 12406=>other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the 
line 12407=>Hedge  or  the  valley of  the Brandywine  beyond  it. Northward, where they 
line 12408=>looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of  the 
line 12409=>great East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea  
line 12410=>of trees, and the horizon was veiled. 
line 12411=>     On the south-eastern  side  the ground fell very  steeply,  as  if  the 
line 12412=>slopes  of  the  hill   were  continued  far  down  under  the  trees,  like 
line 12413=>island-shores that really  are the  sides  of a mountain rising  out of deep 
line 12414=>waters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, 
line 12415=>while they ate their  mid-day meal. As  the sun rose  and  passed  noon they 
line 12416=>glimpsed far  off  in  the east the grey-green lines  of the Downs  that lay 
line 12417=>beyond  the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for  it  was 
line 12418=>good to see a sight of anything beyond the  wood's border s,  though they did  
line 12419=>not mean to go  that way,  if  they  could help it: the Barrow-downs  had as 
line 12420=>sinister a reputation in hobbit -legend as the Forest itself.  
line 12421=>     At length they made up their minds  to go on again. The path  that  had 
line 12422=>brought them to the hill reappeared on  the northward side; but they had not  
line 12423=>followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the 
line 12424=>right.  Soon it  began  to descend  rapidly and they  guessed  that  it must 
line 12425=>actually be heading towards the Withywindle va lley: not at all the direction 
line 12426=>they  wished  lo  take. After some  discussion  they decided to  leave  this 
line 12427=>misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to 
line 12428=>see it  from the hill-top, the Road  must lie that way, and it  could not be 
line 12429=>many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed  
line 12430=>lo  be drier  and more  open,  climbing up to slopes  where  the  trees were 
line 12431=>thinner,  and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes  and other  strange 
line 12432=>and nameless trees  of the denser wood. 
line 12433=>     At first  their  choice  seemed  to  be good: they got along  at a fair 
line 12434=>speed, though whenever they got  a glimpse of the sun  in an open glade they 
line 12435=>seemed  unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But  after a time the  trees 
line 12436=>began to close in again,  just where they had appeared from a distance to be 
line 12437=>thinner and  less tangled. Then  deep  folds  in  the ground were discovered 
line 12438=>
line 12439=>####-unexpectedly, like the ruts of great  giant-wheels or  wide moats and sunken 
line 12440=>roads long disused and choked with  brambles. These lay usually right across 
line 12441=>their  line  of march, and could only be crossed  by scrambling down and out 
line 12442=>again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they 
line 12443=>climbed down they found the  hollow  filled  with  thick bushes  and  matted 
line 12444=>undergrowth, which somehow would not  yield to the  left, but only  gave way 
line 12445=>when they turned to the right; and they  had to go some  distance along  the 
line 12446=>bottom before they could find a  way up  the  further bank.  Each  time they 
line 12447=>clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and  darker;  and always  to the left 
line 12448=>and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the  
line 12449=>right and downwards.  
line 12450=>     After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though 
line 12451=>they knew well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They 
line 12452=>were being headed off,  and were simply following a course chosen for them - 
line 12453=>eastwards and southwards, into the heart of the Forest and not out of it. 
line 12454=>     The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled  into a  
line 12455=>fold that was  wider and  deeper than any they had yet met. It  was so sleep 
line 12456=>and  overhung that  it proved  impossible  to climb out  of it again, either  
line 12457=>forwards  or  backwards, without  leaving  their ponies  and  their  baggage 
line 12458=>behind. All  they could do  was to  follow  the fold - downwards. The ground 
line 12459=>grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they  
line 12460=>found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy 
line 12461=>bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and 
line 12462=>noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully 
line 12463=>over -arched by trees high above them. 
line 12464=>     After stumbling along for some way along  the  stream, they came  quite 
line 12465=>suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before 
line 12466=>them.  Coming  to the opening they found  that they had  made their way down 
line 12467=>through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide 
line 12468=>space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank  
line 12469=>almost as  steep. A golden  afternoon  of  late sunshine lay warm and drowsy 
line 12470=>upon  the hidden land between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a  dark 
line 12471=>river  of brown  water,  bordered with ancient  willows,  arched  over  with 
line 12472=>willows, blocked  with fallen willows,  and flecked with thousands  of faded 
line 12473=>willow-leaves.  The  air was thick  with  them, fluttering  yellow from  the 
line 12474=>branches;  for there  was a  warm  and gentle breeze blowing  softly   in the  
line 12475=>valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking. 
line 12476=>
line 12477=>####-     'Well, now I have at  least some  notion  of where we are!' said Merry. 
line 12478=>'We have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended. This is 
line 12479=>the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore.' 
line 12480=>     He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the  long grasses.  
line 12481=>After a while he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground 
line 12482=>between the cliff-foot and the river; in  some places firm turf went down to 
line 12483=>the water's edge. 'What's more,' he  said, 'there seems to be something like 
line 12484=>a footpath  winding  along on  this side  of the river. If  we turn left and 
line 12485=>follow it, we  shall be bound to  come out on the  east side of  the  Forest 
line 12486=>eventually.' 
line 12487=>     'I dare say!' said Pippin. 'That  is, if the  track goes on so far, and 
line 12488=>does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there.  Who made  the track, 
line 12489=>do you suppose, and why?  I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting  
line 12490=>very suspicious  of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe 
line 12491=>all  the stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we  should  
line 12492=>have to go?' 
line 12493=>     'No,' said Merry, 'I  haven't. I don't  know in the  least how far down 
line 12494=>the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here often enough to 
line 12495=>make 
line 12496=>a path along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.' 
line 12497=>     There being nothing  else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to 
line 12498=>the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and  grasses were lush 
line 12499=>and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy 
line 12500=>to  follow, as it  turned  and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among 
line 12501=>the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed  over other rills, running down 
line 12502=>gullies into the Wi thywindle  out of the higher  forest -lands,  and at these 
line 12503=>points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across.  
line 12504=>     The  hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies  of all 
line 12505=>kinds buzzing round their  ears, and the afternoon sun was burning  on their 
line 12506=>backs.  At last they  came suddenly into a thin shade;  great grey  branches 
line 12507=>reached across  the  path. Each step forward became more  reluctant than the 
line 12508=>last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their  legs, 
line 12509=>and falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes. 
line 12510=>     Frodo  felt his  chin go down and  his head nod. Just in front  of  him 
line 12511=>Pippin fell forward on to his knees.  Frodo halted. 'It's no good,' he heard 
line 12512=>Merry saying. 'Can't go another step  without rest. Must have nap. It's cool 
line 12513=>under the willows. Less flies!' 
line 12514=>
line 12515=>####-     Frodo did not like the sound of this. 'Come  on!' he  cried. 'We  can't  
line 12516=>have a  nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.' But the others were 
line 12517=>too far gone to care. Besi de them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly.  
line 12518=>     Suddenly  Frodo  himself  felt  sleep overwhelming him.  His head swam. 
line 12519=>There now seemed  hardly a sound  in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. 
line 12520=>Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing,  a soft  fluttering as of a song 
line 12521=>half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes 
line 12522=>and  saw leaning over him a  huge willow-tree,  old  and hoary. Enormous  it  
line 12523=>looked,  its  sprawling  branches  going  up like  reaching  arms with  many 
line 12524=>long-fingered hands,  its knotted and twisted trunk gaping  in wide fissures 
line 12525=>that creaked faintly as the boughs  moved. The leaves fluttering against the 
line 12526=>bright sky dazzled  him,  and he toppled over, lying where  he fell upon the 
line 12527=>grass. 
line 12528=>     Merry and Pippin dragged themselves  forward  and  lay down  with their  
line 12529=>backs to  the willow-trunk.  Behind them  the  great  cracks gaped  wide  to 
line 12530=>receive them as the  tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and 
line 12531=>yellow leaves, moving softly against the light, and singing. They shut their 
line 12532=>eyes, and  then it seemed  that  they  could almost hear words,  cool words,  
line 12533=>saying something about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell 
line 12534=>and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow. 
line 12535=>     Frodo   lay for  a while  fighting with  the sleep that was overpowering 
line 12536=>him;  then  with  an  effort  he  struggled  to  his feel again. He  felt  a  
line 12537=>compelling  desire for cool water.  'Wait for me,  Sam,' he  stammered.  'Must  
line 12538=>bathe feet a minute.' 
line 12539=>     Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward  side of the tree, 
line 12540=>where great winding roots grew out into the stream, like  gnarled  dragonets 
line 12541=>straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feel 
line 12542=>in the cool brown water; and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back  
line 12543=>against the tree. 
line 12544=>     Sam sat down and  scratched his head, and yawned like a  cavern. He was 
line 12545=>worried.  The  afternoon  was  getting late,  and  he  thought  this  sudden 
line 12546=>sleepiness  uncanny.  'There's more  behind this than sun and warm air,'  he 
line 12547=>muttered  to himself.  'I don't like this great big tree. I  don't trust it. 
line 12548=>Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won't do at all!' 
line 12549=>     He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become 
line 12550=>of the ponies. He found that  two had wandered on a good way along the path; 
line 12551=>and he had just  caught them and brought them back towards the others,  when 
line 12552=>
line 12553=>####-he  heard two noises; one loud, and the other  soft but very  clear. One was 
line 12554=>the  splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise 
line 12555=>like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast. 
line 12556=>     He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was  in the water close to the  edge, 
line 12557=>and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was 
line 12558=>not struggling. Sam gripped him by the  jacket, and dragged him  from  under 
line 12559=>the root; and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once 
line 12560=>he woke, and coughed and spluttered. 
line 12561=>     'Do you know, Sam,' he said at length, 'the beastly tree  threw me in! I 
line 12562=>felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!' 
line 12563=>     'You were dreaming  I expect, Mr. Frodo,'  said Sam. 'You shouldn't sit 
line 12564=>in such a place, if you feel sleepy.' 
line 12565=>     'What  about the  others?' Frodo asked. 'I wonder  what sort of  dr eams 
line 12566=>they are having.' 
line 12567=>     They went round to the other side of the tree, and  then Sam understood 
line 12568=>the click that he had heard. Pippin  had vanished. The crack by which he had 
line 12569=>laid himself had closed together, so that  not  a chink could be seen. Merry 
line 12570=>was trapped: another crack had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, 
line 12571=>but the  rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of  which  gripped 
line 12572=>like a pair of pincers.  
line 12573=>     Frodo and  Sam beat  first upon the  tree-trunk where Pippin had  lain. 
line 12574=>They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held 
line 12575=>poor Merry. It was quite useless.  
line 12576=>     'What a  foul thing to happen!' cried Frodo  wildly. 'Why  did  we ever  
line 12577=>come into this dreadful  Forest? I wish we were all back at Crickhollow! ' He 
line 12578=>kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless  of  his own  feet. A hardly 
line 12579=>perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves 
line 12580=>rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter. 
line 12581=>     'I suppose we haven't  got an  axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?' asked 
line 12582=>Sam. 
line 12583=>     'I  brought a  little hatchet for chopping firewood,' said Frodo. 'That 
line 12584=>wouldn't be much use.' 
line 12585=>     'Wait a minute!'  cried  Sam, struck by an idea suggested by  firewood. 
line 12586=>'We might do something with fire!' 
line 12587=>     'We might,' said Frodo doubtfully. 'We might succeed in roasting Pippin 
line 12588=>alive inside.' 
line 12589=> 
line 12590=>
line 12591=>####- 
line 12592=>     'We might try  to hurt or  frighten  this tree to begin with,' said Sam 
line 12593=>fiercely. 'If it don't let them go,  I'll  have it down,  if  I have to gnaw 
line 12594=>it.' He  ran to the ponies and before  long  came back with two tinder -boxes 
line 12595=>and a hatchet. 
line 12596=>     Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits  of bark; and made 
line 12597=>a  pile  of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These  they heaped against  the 
line 12598=>trunk  on the far side of the tree from  the prisoners. As soon  as Sam  had 
line 12599=>struck  a spark into  the tinder,  it kindled the dry grass  and a flurry of 
line 12600=>flame and smoke went up. The  twigs crackled. Little fingers  of fire licked 
line 12601=>against  the dry scored rind of  the ancient tree and scorched  it. A tremor  
line 12602=>ran through the whole  willow. The leaves  seemed to hiss above their  heads 
line 12603=>with a sound of pain and anger. A loud  scream came from Merry, and from far 
line 12604=>inside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell. 
line 12605=>     'Put it out! Put it out!' cried Merry. 'He'll squeeze me in two, if you  
line 12606=>don't. He says so!' 
line 12607=>     'Who?  What?' shouted Frodo,  rushing  round  to  the other side of the 
line 12608=>tree. 
line 12609=>     'Put  it out! Put it  out!'  begged Merry.  The  branches of the wi llow 
line 12610=>began to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading 
line 12611=>outwards  to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they 
line 12612=>had  dropped a stone into the quiet slumber  of the river -valley and  set up 
line 12613=>ripples  of anger that  ran out  over the  whole  Forest. Sam kicked at  the 
line 12614=>little fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of 
line 12615=>why he did so, or what he hoped  for, ran  along the path crying help! help! 
line 12616=>help! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill 
line 12617=>voice: it  was  blown away  from  him by  the willow-wind and drowned  in  a  
line 12618=>clamour of leaves,  as soon as the  words left his mouth. He felt desperate: 
line 12619=>lost and witless.  
line 12620=>     Suddenly  he  slopped.  There was an answer, or  so  he  thought; but it 
line 12621=>seemed  to come from  behind him, away down  the  path  further back in  the 
line 12622=>Forest.  He turned round and listened, and soon  there  could  be no  doubt: 
line 12623=>someone was  singing a song; a deep glad voice  was  singing  carelessly and 
line 12624=>happily, but it was singing nonsense: 
line 12625=>     Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! 
line 12626=>     Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! 
line 12627=>     Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! 
line 12628=>
line 12629=>####-     Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both 
line 12630=>stood still. Suddenly  out of  a long string of  nonsense-words (or so  they 
line 12631=>seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song: 
line 12632=>     Hey! Come merry dot! derry dol! My darling! 
line 12633=>     Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling. 
line 12634=>     Down  along under Hill, shining in the sunlight, 
line 12635=>     Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight, 
line 12636=>     There my pretty lady is. River-woman's daughter, 
line 12637=>     Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water. 
line 12638=>     Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing 
line 12639=>     Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing? 
line 12640=>     Hey! Come merry dol! deny dol! and merry-o, 
line 12641=>     Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o! 
line 12642=>     Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away! 
line 12643=>     Tom's in a hurry now. Evening will follow day. 
line 12644=>     Tom's going home again water-lilies bringing. 
line 12645=>     Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?  
line 12646=>     Frodo  and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed  out. The  leaves 
line 12647=>hung silently again on stiff branches. There was  another burst of song, and 
line 12648=>then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there  appeared above the 
line 12649=>reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in 
line 12650=>the band. With another hop and a bound there came into  view a man, or so it 
line 12651=>seemed.  At any rate he wa s  too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not  quite 
line 12652=>tall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for  one, 
line 12653=>slumping along with  great yellow  boots on  his  thick legs,  and  charging 
line 12654=>through grass and rushes like a cow going down to  drink. He had a blue coat 
line 12655=>and a long brown beard; his eyes  were blue and bright, and his face was red 
line 12656=>as  a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred  wrinkles of laughter.  In  his 
line 12657=>hands  he carried  on a  large  leaf  as  on a tray  a  small pile  of white 
line 12658=>water -lilies.  
line 12659=>     'Help!' cried  Frodo  and  Sam  running  towards  him with their  hands 
line 12660=>stretched out. 
line 12661=>     'Whoa! Whoa! steady there!' cried the old man, holding up one hand, and 
line 12662=>they  stopped  short, as  if  they  had been  struck stiff. 'Now,  my little 
line 12663=>fellows, where be you a -going to, puffing like a  bellows? What's the matter  
line 12664=>here  then?  Do  you  know who I am? I'm  Tom Bombadil.  Tell me what's 
line 12665=>your 
line 12666=>
line 12667=>####-trouble! Tom's in a hurry now. Don't you crush my lilies!' 
line 12668=>     'My friends are caught in the willow-tree,' cried Frodo breathlessly. 
line 12669=>     'Master Merry's being squeezed in a crack!' cried Sam. 
line 12670=>     'What?' shouted Tom Bombadil,  leaping up  in the air. 'Old Man Willow? 
line 12671=>Naught  worse than that, eh? That  can soon  be mended. I know the  tune for 
line 12672=>him.  Old  grey Willow-man! I'll freeze his  marrow cold, if he don't behave 
line 12673=>himself. I'll  sing his roots off. I'll sing a  wind up  and blow  leaf  and 
line 12674=>branch  away.  Old Man  Willow!' Setting down his  lilies carefully  on  the 
line 12675=>grass, he  ran to  the tree. There he saw Merry's feet  still sticking out  - 
line 12676=>the rest had already  been  drawn further inside. Tom  put his mouth to  the 
line 12677=>crack  and  began singing  into it in a  low voice. They could not catch the 
line 12678=>words, but  evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick.  Tom sprang 
line 12679=>away,  and breaking off a hanging branch smote  the side of the  willow with  
line 12680=>it. 'You  let  them  out  again, Old  Man Willow!'  he  said. 'What  be  you  
line 12681=>a-thinking  of? You  should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! 
line 12682=>Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!' He then seized  Merry's feet and drew him 
line 12683=>out of the suddenly widening crack. 
line 12684=>     There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it 
line 12685=>Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then  with  a loud snap both cracks 
line 12686=>closed fast again.  A shudder ran  through  the tree  from root to  tip, and 
line 12687=>complete silence fell. 
line 12688=>     'Thank you!' said the hobbits, one after the other. 
line 12689=>     Tom Bombadil burst out  laughing.  'Well,  my little fellows!' said he, 
line 12690=>stooping  so that he peered into their  faces. 'You shall come home with me!  
line 12691=>The  table is  all laden with  yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread  and 
line 12692=>butter. Goldberry is  waiting. Time  enough  for questions around the supper  
line 12693=>table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!' With that he picked up 
line 12694=>his  lilies, and then with a beckoning  wave  of  his hand  went hopping and 
line 12695=>dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly and nonsensically. 
line 12696=>     Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed  a fter him 
line 12697=>as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough. Tom soon disappeared in 
line 12698=>front  of them,  and the noise of his singing got fainter  and further away. 
line 12699=>Suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a loud halloo!  
line 12700=>     Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle! 
line 12701=>     Tom's going on ahead candles for to kindle. 
line 12702=>     Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping. 
line 12703=>     When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open, 
line 12704=>
line 12705=>####-     Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.  
line 12706=>     Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow! 
line 12707=>     Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you. 
line 12708=>     Hey now! merry dot! We'll be waiting for you! 
line 12709=>     After that the hobbits heard  no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to 
line 12710=>sink  into  the  trees  behind them. They thought of the slanting  light  of 
line 12711=>evening glittering on the  Brandywine River, and  the windows  of Bucklebury 
line 12712=>beginning  to gleam with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them; 
line 12713=>trunks and branches of trees hung  dark and threatening over the path. White  
line 12714=>mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the 
line 12715=>roots  of the trees upon its borders. Out of the very ground at their feet a  
line 12716=>shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk. 
line 12717=>     It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their 
line 12718=>legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on 
line 12719=>either  side of them; and if  they looked  up  to the pale sky,  they caught 
line 12720=>sight  of  queer  gnarled  and knobbly  faces that gloomed dark against  the 
line 12721=>twilight,  and leered down at them  from the high bank and the edges of  the 
line 12722=>wood. They  began to feel that  all this  country was unreal,  and that they 
line 12723=>were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening. 
line 12724=>     Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed 
line 12725=>that the  ground  was  gently  rising.  The  water  began to murmur. In  the 
line 12726=>darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the  river flowed over  
line 12727=>a short fall. Then suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left  
line 12728=>behind. They  stepped out from the  Forest, and found a wide sweep  of grass 
line 12729=>welling up before them. The  river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily 
line 12730=>down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars,  which 
line 12731=>were already shining in the sky. 
line 12732=>     The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown 
line 12733=>or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped, and trim as a hedge. 
line 12734=>The path was now plain before  them, well-tended and bordered with stone. It 
line 12735=>wound  up on to the top  of a grassy knoll,  now grey under  the pale starry 
line 12736=>night; and there,  still high  above them  on a further slope, they saw  the 
line 12737=>twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up aga in, up 
line 12738=>a  long smooth  hillside of  turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow 
line 12739=>beam  flowed out  brightly  from a  door  that  was  opened.  There  was Tom 
line 12740=>Bombadil's  house  before them, up,  down,  under hill. Behind  it  a  steep 
line 12741=>shoulder of the land  lay grey and bare,  and beyond that the dark shapes of 
line 12742=>
line 12743=>####-the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night. 
line 12744=>     They  all hurried  forward,  hobbits  and  ponies. Already  half  their 
line 12745=>weariness  and all their fears  had fallen from them. Hey! Come  merry  dol! 
line 12746=>rolled out the song to greet them. 
line 12747=>     Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties! 
line 12748=>     Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties. 
line 12749=>     Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together! 
line 12750=>     Then  another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like  the 
line 12751=>song of a glad water flowing  down  into  the night from a bright morning in 
line 12752=>the hills, came falling like silver to meet them: 
line 12753=>     Now let the song begin! Let us sing together 
line 12754=>     Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather, 
line 12755=>     Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather, 
line 12756=>     Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather, 
line 12757=>     Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water: 
line 12758=>     Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter! 
line 12759=>     And  with that song the hobbits stood upon  the threshold, and a golden 
line 12760=>light was all about them. 
line 12761=> 
line 12762=>
line 12763=>####- 
line 12764=>
line 12765=>Chapter 7. In the House of Tom Bombadil 
line 12766=>
line 12767=> 
line 12768=> 
line 12769=>     The four hobbits stepped  over the  wide  stone  threshold,  and  stood 
line 12770=>still,  blinking. They  were in a  long  low room,  filled with the light of 
line 12771=>lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished 
line 12772=>wood stood many candles, tall and yellow, burning brightly. 
line 12773=>     In a  chair, at the far side of the room  facing  the outer door, sat a  
line 12774=>woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders;  her  gown was 
line 12775=>green, 
line 12776=>green as young reeds, shot  with silver like beads  of dew; and her belt was 
line 12777=>of gold, shaped like a chain  of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue  eyes of 
line 12778=>forget-me-nots.  About  her  feel  in  wide   vessels  of  green  and  brown 
line 12779=>earthenware, white water -lilies  were  floating,  so that she  seemed  to be 
line 12780=>enthroned in the midst of a pool. 
line 12781=>     'Enter, good guests!'  she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was 
line 12782=>her  clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further  
line 12783=>into  the room,  and  began  to bow  low,  feeling  strangely surprised  and 
line 12784=>awkward,  like folk that, knocking at a  cottage door to  beg for a drink of 
line 12785=>water, have been answered  by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers.  
line 12786=>But  before they could  say anything, she  sprang  lightly up  and  over the 
line 12787=>lily-bowls,  and ran  laughing towards them; and as she ran her gown rustled 
line 12788=>softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river. 
line 12789=>     'Come dear  folk!' she said,  taking Frodo by the hand.  'Laugh  and be  
line 12790=>merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of  the River.' Then lightly she passed them 
line 12791=>and closing the door she turned her back to  it, with her  white arms spread 
line 12792=>out  across  it. 'Let us  shut out the night!'  she said. 'For you are still 
line 12793=>afraid, per haps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. 
line 12794=>Fear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.' 
line 12795=>     The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and  
line 12796=>smiled. 'Fair lady  Goldberry!' said Frodo at last,  feeling his heart moved 
line 12797=>with  a joy that he did not understand. He stood  as  he had at times  stood 
line 12798=>enchanted by fair elven-voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was 
line 12799=>different:  less keen and lofty  was the  delight, but deeper and nearer  to 
line 12800=>mortal heart; marvellous and yet not strange. 'Fair lady Goldberry!' he said 
line 12801=>again. 'Now the joy that  was hidden in the songs we heard is  made plain to 
line 12802=>
line 12803=>####-me. 
line 12804=>     O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water! 
line 12805=>     O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter! 
line 12806=>     O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after! 
line 12807=>     O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!'  
line 12808=>     Suddenly he  stopped  and  stammered,  overcome  with surprise  to hear  
line 12809=>himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed. 
line 12810=>     'Welcome!'  she said.  'I had not heard that folk of the  Shire were so 
line 12811=>sweet-tongued. But I see you are an elf-friend; the light  in your eyes  and 
line 12812=>the ring in your voice tells it. This is  a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait 
line 12813=>for the Master   of the house! He will not be long. He is tending  your tired 
line 12814=>beasts.' 
line 12815=>     The hobbits sat down gladly in  low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry 
line 12816=>busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender  
line 12817=>grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere  behind 
line 12818=>the house came the sound of singing. Every now and again they caught,  among 
line 12819=>many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dillo  the repeated words:  
line 12820=>     Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;  
line 12821=>     Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.  
line 12822=>     'Fair  lady!'  said Frodo again after  a  while. 'Tell me, if my asking 
line 12823=>does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?' 
line 12824=>     'He is,' said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling. 
line 12825=>     Frodo looked a t her questioningly.  'He is, as you  have seen him,' she 
line 12826=>said in answer to his look. 'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.' 
line 12827=>     'Then all this strange land belongs to him?' 
line 12828=>     'No indeed!' she answered, and her smile faded. 'That would indeed be a 
line 12829=>burden,'  she added  in  a low voice, as if to herself. 'The trees  and  the 
line 12830=>grasses  and  all things growing  or  living  in  the  land belong  each  to 
line 12831=>themselves.  Tom  Bombadil is the Master. No  one has ever  caught  old  Tom 
line 12832=>walking in the forest,  wading in the  water, leaping on the hill-tops under  
line 12833=>light and shadow. He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.' 
line 12834=>     A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his 
line 12835=>thick 
line 12836=>brown  hair  was  crowned  with  autumn leaves.  He laughed,  and   going  to 
line 12837=>Goldberry, took her hand. 
line 12838=>     'Here's my pretty  lady!'  he said,  bowing  to the hobbits. 'Here's my 
line 12839=>Goldberry clothed all  in silver -green  with flowers in  her girdle! Is  the 
line 12840=>
line 12841=>####-table  laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter; 
line 12842=>milk, cheese,  and green herbs and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for  
line 12843=>us? Is the supper ready?' 
line 12844=>     'It is,' said Goldberry; 'but the guests perhaps are not?' 
line 12845=>     Tom clapped his hands and cried:  'Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and 
line 12846=>you had near forgotten! Come now,  my  merry  friends, and Tom  will refresh 
line 12847=>you! You shall clean  grimy  hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your 
line 12848=>muddy cloaks and comb out your tangles!' 
line 12849=>     He  opened the door, and they followed  him  down  a short passage  and  
line 12850=>round  a  sharp  turn. They  came  to  a low  room  with a  sloping  roof (a 
line 12851=>penthouse, it  seemed, built on  to  the north end  of the house). Its walls 
line 12852=>were  of clean stone, but they were  mostly covered  with green hanging mats 
line 12853=>and  yellow curtains. The  floor  was flagged, and  strewn with  fresh green 
line 12854=>rushes. There were four deep  mattresses, each  piled  with white  blankets,  
line 12855=>laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long bench  
line 12856=>laden with wide earthenware basins,  and beside it stood  brown ewers filled 
line 12857=>with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set 
line 12858=>ready beside each bed. 
line 12859=>     Before long, washed and  refreshed,  the  hobbits  were  seated  at the 
line 12860=>table, two on  each side, while at e ither end sat Goldberry  and the Master. 
line 12861=>It  was  a long and  merry  meal. Though  the hobbits ate, as only  famished 
line 12862=>hobbits can eat, there was no lack. The drink in their drinking-bowls seemed 
line 12863=>to be clear cold water, yet it went to  their hearts like  wi ne and set free 
line 12864=>their  voices.  The guests  became  suddenly aware  that  they were  singing 
line 12865=>merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking. 
line 12866=>     At  last Tom  and Goldberry rose and  cleared  the  table  swiftly. The 
line 12867=>guests were  commanded to  sit  quiet,  and were set in chairs,  each with a  
line 12868=>footstool to  his  tired  feet. There was a  fire  in the wide hearth before 
line 12869=>them,  and  it  was  burning with  a  sweet smell, as  if it were  built  of 
line 12870=>apple-wood. When  everything  was set in  order,  a ll the lights in the room 
line 12871=>were put  out, except one  lamp  and  a pair of candles at each  end of  the 
line 12872=>chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and  stood before them, holding a candle; 
line 12873=>and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep. 
line 12874=>     'Have peace now,' she said, 'until the morning! Heed no nightly noises! 
line 12875=>For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the 
line 12876=>wind  off the hill-top. Good  night!'  She passed  out  of  the room  with a  
line 12877=>glimmer and  a rustle. The sound  of her footsteps was like a stream falling 
line 12878=>
line 12879=>####-gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night. 
line 12880=>     Tom sat on a while beside  them in silence, while each of them tried to 
line 12881=>muster the courage to ask  one of the many questions he had meant to  ask at 
line 12882=>supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke: 
line 12883=>     'Did  you  hear me calling, Master, or was  it just chance that brought 
line 12884=>you at that moment?' 
line 12885=>     Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. 'Eh, what?' said 
line 12886=>he. 'Did I  hear you calling?  Nay, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just  
line 12887=>chance brought  me then,  if  chance  you call it.  It was no  plan of mine, 
line 12888=>though I was waiting  for you.  We heard  news of you,  and learned that you 
line 12889=>were wandering. We guessed you'd come ere long down to the water:  all paths 
line 12890=>lead  that  way, down to  Withywindle. Old grey  Willow-man, he's  a  mighty 
line 12891=>singer; and it's hard for little folk to escape  his cunning mazes.  But Tom 
line 12892=>had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.' Tom  nodded as if sleep  was 
line 12893=>taking him again; but he went on in a soft singing voice: 
line 12894=>     I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies, 
line 12895=>     green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady, 
line 12896=>     the last ere the year's end to keep them from the winter, 
line 12897=>     to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted. 
line 12898=>     Each year at summer's end I go to find them for her, 
line 12899=>     in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle; 
line 12900=>     there they open first in spring and there they linger latest. 
line 12901=>     By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter, 
line 12902=>     fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes. 
line 12903=>     Sweet was her singing then, and her heart was beating! 
line 12904=>     He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue: 
line 12905=>     And that proved well for you -- for now I shall no longer 
line 12906=>     go down deep again along the forest-water, 
line 12907=>     not while the year is old. Nor shall I be passing 
line 12908=>     Old Man Willow's house this side of spring-time, 
line 12909=>     not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter 
line 12910=>     dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water. 
line 12911=>     He  fell  silent  again;  but  Frodo  could  not help asking  one  more 
line 12912=>question: the one he most desired to have answered.  'Tell  us, Master,'  he 
line 12913=>said, 'about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.' 
line 12914=>     'No, don't!' said Merry and  Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. 
line 12915=>'Not now! Not until the morning!' 
line 12916=>
line 12917=>####-     'That is right!' said the old man.  'Now  is the time for resting. Some 
line 12918=>things  are  ill  to hear  when  the  world's  in  shadow.  Sleep  till  the 
line 12919=>morning-light, rest on  the  pillow! Heed no nightly  noise!  Fear  no  grey 
line 12920=>willow!' And with that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a 
line 12921=>candle in either hand he led them out of the room. 
line 12922=>     Their mattresses and  pillows were soft as down, and  the blankets were 
line 12923=>of white  wool. They had hardly laid  themselves on the deep beds and  drawn 
line 12924=>the light covers over them before they were asleep. 
line 12925=>     In the dead night, Frodo lay  in a dream without light. Then he saw the 
line 12926=>young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall 
line 12927=>of  rock, pierced by a  dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that 
line 12928=>he was lifted up, and passing over he saw that the rock -wall was a circle of 
line 12929=>hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a  
line 12930=>pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood 
line 12931=>the figure of  a man. The moon as it rose seemed to hang for a  moment above 
line 12932=>his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the 
line 12933=>dark plain below came the crying  of fell voices, and  the  howling of  many  
line 12934=>wolves. Suddenly  a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across the 
line 12935=>moon. The figure lifted his arms and a  light flashed from the staff that he 
line 12936=>wielded. A mighty ea gle  swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed 
line 12937=>and 
line 12938=>the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it 
line 12939=>was borne the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East.  
line 12940=>'Black Riders!'  thought  Frodo as  he wakened, with the  sound of the hoofs 
line 12941=>still  echoing in his  mind.  He wondered if  he would ever  again  have the 
line 12942=>courage to leave the safety  of these stone walls. He lay  motionless, still 
line 12943=>listening;  but all  was now silent, and  at last he turned and fell  asleep 
line 12944=>again or wandered into some other unremembered dream. 
line 12945=>     At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly;  but a change came over his 
line 12946=>dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had 
line 12947=>waked, 
line 12948=>and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his  dream: 
line 12949=>tip-tap,  squeak:  the  noise  was  like  branches  fretting  in  the  wind, 
line 12950=>twig-fingers scraping  wall and window: creak, creak, creak. He wondered  if 
line 12951=>there were  willow-trees close  to  the  house; and  then suddenly he  had a  
line 12952=>dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all, but inside the 
line 12953=>willow and listening  to that horrible dry  creaking  voice laughing  at him 
line 12954=>
line 12955=>####-again. He sat up,  and felt the soft pillows yield to  his hands, and he lay 
line 12956=>down again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his  ears: 'Fear  
line 12957=>nothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!' Then he went 
line 12958=>to sleep again. 
line 12959=>     It  was the  sound of  water  that Merry heard falling  into  his quiet 
line 12960=>sleep:   water  streaming  down   gently,  and  then   spreading,  spreading 
line 12961=>irresistibly all round  the  house  into a  dark shoreless pool. It  gurgled 
line 12962=>under the walls, and was  rising slowly but surely. 'I shall be drowned!' he 
line 12963=>thought. It will find its  way in,  and then I shall drown.' He felt that he 
line 12964=>was  lying  in a soft slimy bog,  and  springing up  he set  his fool on the 
line 12965=>corner of  a  cold hard  flagstone. Then he  remembered where he was and lay 
line 12966=>down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: 'Nothing passes doors  or 
line 12967=>windows save moonlight  and  starlight  and  the wind off  the  hill-top.' A 
line 12968=>little  breath of sweet air moved  the  curtain. He breathed deep  and  fell 
line 12969=>asleep again. 
line 12970=>     As far  as  he could  remember, Sam slept  through the  night  in  deep 
line 12971=>content, if logs are contented. 
line 12972=>     They woke  up, all four  at  once, in the morning light. Tom was moving 
line 12973=>about the room whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped 
line 12974=>his hands, and cried:  'Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!' He drew 
line 12975=>back the  yellow curtains, and  the hobbits  saw that these  had covered the 
line 12976=>windows, at either end of the room, one looking east  and the other  looking  
line 12977=>west. 
line 12978=>     They leapt up  refreshed. Frodo  ran  to the eastern window, and  found 
line 12979=>himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had half expected to 
line 12980=>see turf right up to the  walls, turf all pocked  with hoof-prints. Actually 
line 12981=>his view was screened  by a  tall line of beans on poles; but above and  far 
line 12982=>beyond them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a  
line 12983=>pale  morning: in the East,  behind long  clouds like lines  of  soiled wool 
line 12984=>stained red at the  edges, lay glimmering deeps of  yellow. The sky spoke of 
line 12985=>rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly,  and the red  flowers on 
line 12986=>the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves.  
line 12987=>     Pippin looked out of  the western window, down into a pool of mist. The  
line 12988=>Forest  was hidden  under a fog. It was  like looking down  on to  a sloping 
line 12989=>cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken 
line 12990=>into many plumes and billows; the valley of  the Withywindle. The stream ran 
line 12991=>down  the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. Near at hand 
line 12992=>
line 12993=>####-was a flower -garden and a clipped  hedge silver -netted, and beyond that grey 
line 12994=>shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be seen. 
line 12995=>     'Good  morning,  merry  friends!' cried Tom, opening the eastern window 
line 12996=>wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a  rainy smell. 'Sun  won't show her face 
line 12997=>much today. I'm thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping on the hilltops,  
line 12998=>since the grey dawn began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet 
line 12999=>sky above me.  I wakened Goldberry singing under  window;  but  nought 
line 13000=>wakes 
line 13001=>hobbit-folk in  the early morning. In the night little  folk wake up in  the 
line 13002=>darkness, and sleep after light has come! Ring  a  ding dillo! Wake now,  my  
line 13003=>merry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring  a ding dillo del! derry del, 
line 13004=>my  hearties!  If you  come  soon you'll find breakfast on the table. If you  
line 13005=>come late you'll get grass and rain-water!' 
line 13006=>     Needless  to  say - not that Tom's threat  sounded  very  serious  - the 
line 13007=>hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo  
line 13008=>look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry  were there. Tom could be heard 
line 13009=>about  the house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and 
line 13010=>singing  here  and  there  outside.  The  room  looked   westward  over  the 
line 13011=>mist -clouded valley, and the  window was open. Water dripped  down  from the 
line 13012=>thatched  eaves above. Before  they had  finished  breakfast the  clouds had 
line 13013=>joined into  an  unbroken roof,  and  a  straight grey rain came softly  and 
line 13014=>steadily down. Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled. 
line 13015=>     As they looked out of  the window there came falling gently as if it was 
line 13016=>flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear  voice  of Goldberry singing 
line 13017=>up above them. They could hear  few  words, but it seemed plain to them that 
line 13018=>the  song was a rain-song, as sweet as  showers on dry hills,  that told the 
line 13019=>tale  of a river from the  spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The 
line 13020=>hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his  heart, and blessed 
line 13021=>the kindly weather,  because it delayed them from departing. The  thought of 
line 13022=>going had been heavy upon him from  the moment  he awoke; but he guessed 
line 13023=>now 
line 13024=>that they would not go further that day. 
line 13025=>     The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds  rolled 
line 13026=>up  to spill their laden rain on the  bare heads of the Downs. Nothing could 
line 13027=>be seen all round the house but  falling  water.  Frodo  stood near the open 
line 13028=>door and watched the white chalky path turn into a little  river of milk and 
line 13029=>
line 13030=>####-go bubbling away down into the  valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round 
line 13031=>the 
line 13032=>corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain  - and 
line 13033=>indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite dry, except for his 
line 13034=>boots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then  he  sat in the 
line 13035=>largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him. 
line 13036=>     'This is Goldberry's  washing  day,' he said, 'and her autumn-cleaning. 
line 13037=>Too wet for hobbit-folk - let them rest while they are able! It's a good day 
line 13038=>for  long  tales, for  questions and for  answers,  so Tom  will  start  the 
line 13039=>talking.' 
line 13040=>     He  then  told  them many remarkable  stories,  sometimes  half  as  if 
line 13041=>speaking to  himself, sometimes looking at  them suddenly with a bright blue 
line 13042=>eye  under  his deep brows. Often his voice would turn to song, and he would 
line 13043=>get  out of  his chair  and  dance about.  He  told them tales of  bees  and 
line 13044=>flowers,  the ways of trees, and the strange creatures  of the Forest, about 
line 13045=>the  evil things  and good  things,  things  friendly and things unfriendly, 
line 13046=>cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles. 
line 13047=>     As they  listened,  they began to  understand  the lives of the Forest, 
line 13048=>apart from themselves, indeed to  feel themselves as the strangers where all 
line 13049=>other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out  of his talk was Old 
line 13050=>Man  Willow, and Frodo learned now enough to content him, indeed  more  
line 13051=>than 
line 13052=>enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom's words laid bare the hearts of 
line 13053=>trees and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with 
line 13054=>a  hatred of things that go free upon the  earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, 
line 13055=>hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called  the Old Forest  
line 13056=>without reason,  for  it  was indeed ancient,  a survivor  of vast forgotten 
line 13057=>woods;  and  in it there  lived  yet, ageing no quicker than the hills,  the 
line 13058=>fathers of the fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The  
line 13059=>countless  years  had  filled  them with pride  and rooted wisdom,  and with 
line 13060=>malice.  But none were more dangerous  than the Great Willow:  his heart was 
line 13061=>rotten, but his strength was  green; and  he was cunning,  and  a master  of 
line 13062=>winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods  on both sides  of the  
line 13063=>river.  His grey  thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like 
line 13064=>fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till 
line 13065=>it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest  from the Hedge 
line 13066=>to the Downs.  
line 13067=>
line 13068=>####-     Suddenly  Tom's talk  left  the woods and  went leaping  up  the  young 
line 13069=>stream, over  bubbling  waterfalls,  over  pebbles and worn rocks, and among 
line 13070=>small flowers in close  grass and wet crannies, wandering at  last up  on to 
line 13071=>the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows, and the  green  mounds,  and the 
line 13072=>stone-rings  upon the  hills and in the hollows among the hills.  Sheep were 
line 13073=>bleating in flocks. Green  walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses 
line 13074=>on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms fought together, and the young  Sun 
line 13075=>shone like fire  on the red metal of their  new and greedy swords. There was 
line 13076=>victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went  
line 13077=>up into the sky. Gold was piled on the  biers of dead kings and queens;  and 
line 13078=>mounds covered them, and the stone  doors were shut; and the grass grew over  
line 13079=>all. Sheep  walked  for a while biting the  grass,  but soon the hills  were 
line 13080=>empty again.  A  shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were 
line 13081=>stirred in  the  mounds.  Barrow-wights walked in  the hollow places  with a  
line 13082=>clink of  rings on  cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind.'  Stone rings 
line 13083=>grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight. 
line 13084=>     The  hobbits   shuddered.   Even  in  the   Shire  the  rumour  of  the 
line 13085=>Barrow-wights of  the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had  been heard. But it 
line 13086=>was not a tale that  any  hobbit  liked to listen  to, even by a comfortable 
line 13087=>fireside far away. These  four now  suddenly remembered what the joy of this 
line 13088=>house had  driven from their minds: the  house of Tom Bombadil nestled under 
line 13089=>the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. They   lost the thread of  his tale 
line 13090=>and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another. 
line 13091=>     When they caught his  words again  they found that he had  now wandered 
line 13092=>into  strange regions beyond their  memory and  beyond their waking thought, 
line 13093=>into  limes when the world was wider, and  the  seas flowed straight to  the 
line 13094=>western  Shore;  and  still on  and back Tom went  singing out  into ancient 
line 13095=>starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and 
line 13096=>they saw that he nodded  as if he was falling asleep.  The hobbits sat still 
line 13097=>before  him, enchanted; and it  seemed as if, under the  spell of his words, 
line 13098=>the wind  had gone, and the clouds had  dried  up,  and  the  day  had  been 
line 13099=>withdrawn, and darkness  had  come from  East and West, and all  the sky was 
line 13100=>filled with the light of white stars.  
line 13101=>     Whether the morning and evening of  one  day or of many days had passed 
line 13102=>Frodo could not tell.  He did not feel either hungry  or tired,  only filled 
line 13103=>with  wonder.  The  stars shone through the window and the  silence  of  the  
line 13104=>heavens seemed  to be round  him. He spoke at  last out  of his wonder and a  
line 13105=>
line 13106=>####-sudden fear of that silence: 
line 13107=>     'Who are you, Master?' he asked. 
line 13108=>     'Eh, what?' said  Tom sitting up,  and  his eyes glinting in the gloom. 
line 13109=>'Don't you know my name yet? That's the only  answer. Tell me,  who are you, 
line 13110=>alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that's 
line 13111=>what I am. Mark my words, my friends: Tom was here before  the river and the 
line 13112=>trees;  Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first  acorn. He made paths 
line 13113=>before  the Big  People,  and saw  the  little People arriving.  He was here 
line 13114=>before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights. When the Elves passed 
line 13115=>westward, Tom was here already, before the  seas were bent. He knew the dark 
line 13116=>under  the stars when it  was  fearless  -  before  the Dark  Lord came  from 
line 13117=>Outside.' 
line 13118=>     A shadow seemed to pass by the  window, and the hobbits glanced hastily 
line 13119=>through  the  panes.  When they  turned again, Goldberry stood  in the  door  
line 13120=>behind,  framed in  light. She held a  candle, shielding its flame  from the 
line 13121=>draught  with her hand;  and the  light  flowed through  it,  like  sunlight 
line 13122=>through a white shell. 
line 13123=>     'The  rain has ended,' she said; 'and new waters are running  downhill, 
line 13124=>under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!' 
line 13125=>     'And let us have  food and drink!' cried Tom. 'Long tales are  thirsty. 
line 13126=>And long listening's hungry work, morning, noon,  and evening!' With that he 
line 13127=>jumped  out  of  his  chair,  and  with  a  bound took  a  candle  from  the 
line 13128=>chimney-shelf and lit it  in the flame that Goldberry held;  then he  danced 
line 13129=>about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared. 
line 13130=>     Quickly  he returned, bearing a  large and laden  tray.  Then  Tom  and 
line 13131=>Goldberry  set the table; and  the  hobbits sat  half in  wonder and half in 
line 13132=>laughter: so  fair  was  the grace  of Goldberry  and so  merry and odd  the 
line 13133=>caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they  seemed to  weave a single dance, 
line 13134=>neither hindering the other, in  and out of  the  room, and  round about the 
line 13135=>table; and with great speed food and vessels and  lights were set  in order. 
line 13136=>The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow.  Tom bowed to his  guests.  
line 13137=>'Supper is ready,'  said Goldberry; and now the  hobbits  saw that  she  was 
line 13138=>clothed all in silver with  a white girdle, and her  shoes were like fishes' 
line 13139=>mail. But Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain -washed forget-me-nots, and 
line 13140=>he had green stockings.  
line 13141=>     It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of 
line 13142=>
line 13143=>####-Tom's words may have  missed one meal or many,  but when the food was 
line 13144=>before 
line 13145=>them it seemed at  least a week  since they had eaten. They did not  sing or  
line 13146=>even speak much for a while, and paid close attention to business. But after  
line 13147=>a time their hearts and spirit rose high again, and their voices rang out in 
line 13148=>mirth and laughter. 
line 13149=>     After they had eaten,  Goldberry  sang many songs for them, songs  that 
line 13150=>began  merrily  in the  hills and fell softly down into  silence; and in the 
line 13151=>silences they saw in their minds pools and  waters wider  than any  they had 
line 13152=>known, and looking into them they  saw the sky below them and the stars like 
line 13153=>jewels in the  depths. Then  once more she wished them  each  good night and 
line 13154=>left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them 
line 13155=>with 
line 13156=>questions.  
line 13157=>     He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and  
line 13158=>indeed  to know much of  all the history  and doings of  the Shire down from  
line 13159=>days hardly remembered among the hobbits  themselves. It  no longer surprised 
line 13160=>them; but he  made no secret that he owed  his  recent knowledge  largely to 
line 13161=>Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more  importance 
line 13162=>than 
line 13163=>they had imagined.  'There's earth under  his  old  feet, and  clay  on  his 
line 13164=>fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both  his eyes are open,' said Tom. It was 
line 13165=>also clear that Tom  had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some  
line 13166=>fashion, news had reached him from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo. 
line 13167=>     Indeed  so much did Tom know, and so cunning  was his questioning, that 
line 13168=>Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and his own hopes and fears 
line 13169=>than he  had told before even to  Gandalf. Tom wagged  his head up and down, 
line 13170=>and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders. 
line 13171=>     'Show me  the  precious  Ring!'  he said suddenly  in the  midst of the 
line 13172=>story: and  Frodo, to his  own astonishment,  drew  out the chain  from  his 
line 13173=>pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom. 
line 13174=>     It  seemed  to  grow  larger  as  it  lay  for  a  moment  on  his  big 
line 13175=>brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it  to his eye  and laughed.  For a  
line 13176=>second the  hobbits had a vision, both comical and  alarming, of his  bright 
line 13177=>blue  eye gleaming through a circle of gold. Then Tom put the Ring round the 
line 13178=>end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the 
line 13179=>hobbits noticed nothing strange about this.  Then they gasped. There was  no  
line 13180=>
line 13181=>####-sign of Tom disappearing!  
line 13182=>     Tom  laughed again,  and then he  spun  the Ring in  the  air  - and it 
line 13183=>vanished with a flash. Frodo  gave a cry - and Tom leaned forward and handed 
line 13184=>it back to him with a smile. 
line 13185=>     Frodo looked at it closely, and rather  suspiciously (like one  who has 
line 13186=>lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring, or looked  the same  and 
line 13187=>weighed  the same:  for that  Ring had  always  seemed  to  Frodo  to  weigh 
line 13188=>strangely heavy in the hand. But something prompted him to make sure. He 
line 13189=>was 
line 13190=>perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so  light of what even 
line 13191=>Gandalf thought so perilously important. He waited  for an opportunity, when 
line 13192=>the talk was going again, and Tom  was telling an absurd story about badgers 
line 13193=>and their queer ways  - then he slipped the Ring on. 
line 13194=>     Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked 
line 13195=>an exclamation.  Frodo was delighted (in a  way):  it was  his own ring  all 
line 13196=>right, for Merry was staring blankly  at his  chair, and obviously could not 
line 13197=>see him. He  got up and  crept  quietly away from  the  fireside towards the 
line 13198=>outer door. 
line 13199=>     'Hey there!' cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in 
line 13200=>his shining eyes. 'Hey!  Come  Frodo, there!  Where be you  a -going? Old Tom 
line 13201=>Bombadil's not as blind  as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand's 
line 13202=>more fair without it. Come back! Leave your game and  sit down beside me! 
line 13203=>We 
line 13204=>must  talk a while more, and  think about the  morning.  Tom  must teach the  
line 13205=>right road, and keep your feet from wandering.' 
line 13206=>     Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came 
line 13207=>and  sat down  again. Tom now told them that he reckoned the Sun would shine 
line 13208=>tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting  out would be hopeful. 
line 13209=>But they  would do well to start early; for weather in  that  country was  a  
line 13210=>thing  that  even Tom could  not be sure  of  for long, and it would  change 
line 13211=>sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket.  'I am no weather -master,' 
line 13212=>he said; 'nor is aught that goes on two legs.' 
line 13213=>     By his  advice  they  decided to make nearly  due North from his house, 
line 13214=>over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might hope  in that way 
line 13215=>to strike  the East Road in a day's journey, and avoid the  Barrows. He told 
line 13216=>them not to be afraid  - but to mind their own business.  
line 13217=>     'Keep to  the green grass. Don't you go  a -meddling  with old stone  or  
line 13218=>
line 13219=>####-cold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts 
line 13220=>that never falter!' He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass 
line 13221=>barrows  by on the west-side, if  they  chanced to stray near  one.  Then he 
line 13222=>taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill -luck fall into any danger  
line 13223=>or difficulty the next day. 
line 13224=>     Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! 
line 13225=>     By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,  
line 13226=>     By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! 
line 13227=>     Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us! 
line 13228=>     When they had sung this  altogether after him, he  clapped them each on 
line 13229=>the shoulder with  a  laugh,  and taking  candles  led them  back  to  their 
line 13230=>bedroom. 
line 13231=>
line 13232=>####- 
line 13233=> 
line 13234=>
line 13235=>Chapter 8. Fog on the Barrow-Downs 
line 13236=>
line 13237=> 
line 13238=> 
line 13239=>     That night  they heard no noises.  But either in his  dreams or  out of 
line 13240=>them,  he could not tell which,  Frodo heard a sweet singing running  in his 
line 13241=>mind;  a  song  that  seemed  to  come  like  a  pale  light behind  a  grey 
line 13242=>rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, 
line 13243=>until at last it was rolled back, and a  far green country opened before him 
line 13244=>under a swift sunrise. 
line 13245=>     The vision  melted  into  waking; and  there  was  Tom whistling like a  
line 13246=>tree-full of birds;  and the  sun was already  slanting  down the  hill  and 
line 13247=>through the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold. 
line 13248=>     After breakfast, which they  again  ate  alone,  they made ready to say 
line 13249=>farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such  a morning: cool, 
line 13250=>bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh 
line 13251=>from the  North-west. Their quiet  ponies were almost  frisky,  sniffing and 
line 13252=>moving  restlessly. Tom came out  of the house and  waved his hat and danced 
line 13253=>upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good  
line 13254=>speed. 
line 13255=>     They rode off along a path  that  wound away from behind the house, and  
line 13256=>went slanting  up towards the north  end  of  the hill-brow  under which  it 
line 13257=>sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their  ponies up the last  steep 
line 13258=>slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped. 
line 13259=>     'Goldberry!' he cried. 'My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have 
line 13260=>never said  farewell  to her, nor seen  her  since the evening!' He  was  so 
line 13261=>distressed tha t he turned  back;  but at  that  moment  a  clear  call  came 
line 13262=>rippling down. There on the  hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair 
line 13263=>was flying loose,  and as it caught the sun it shone and  shimmered. A light 
line 13264=>like the glint  of  water on dewy grass  flashed from under her  feet as she 
line 13265=>danced. 
line 13266=>     They hastened up the  last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They 
line 13267=>bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they  looked 
line 13268=>out from the hill-top  over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and  
line 13269=>far-seen as it  had been veiled and misty  when they stood upon the knoll in 
line 13270=>the  Forest,  which could now be seen rising pale and green out of  the dark 
line 13271=>trees in the West. In that direction the land rose in  wooded ridges, green, 
line 13272=>
line 13273=>####-yellow,  russet under  the sun, beyond which lay hidden the  valley  of  the 
line 13274=>Brandywine. To the South, over  the  line of  the Withywindle,  there was  a  
line 13275=>distant glint like pale glass where  the Brandywine River  made a great loop  
line 13276=>in the  lowlands  and  flowed   away  out of  the  knowledge of the  hobbits.  
line 13277=>Northward  beyond  the dwindling  downs  the land  ran  away  in  flats  and 
line 13278=>swellings of grey  and green and pale earth -colours, until it  faded  into a  
line 13279=>featureless and  shadowy  distance.  Eastward  the Barrow-downs  rose, ridge 
line 13280=>behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it 
line 13281=>was no more  than a guess of  blue and a remote  white glimmer blending with 
line 13282=>the hem of the sky,  but it spoke to them, out of  memory  and old tales, of 
line 13283=>the high and distant mountains. 
line 13284=>     They  took a deep draught  of  the air, and felt that a skip and  a few 
line 13285=>stout strides would  bear  them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted  
line 13286=>to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs  towards the Road, 
line 13287=>when they  should be leaping,  as lusty as Tom, over the stepping  stones of 
line 13288=>the hills straight towards the Mountains.  
line 13289=>     Goldberry spoke  to them  and recalled their eyes and thoughts.  'Speed 
line 13290=>now, fair guests!'  she said. 'And hold to your purpose! North with the wind 
line 13291=>in  the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the  Sun 
line 13292=>shines!'  And  to Frodo  she  said:  'Farewell,  Elf-friend, it was a  merry 
line 13293=>meeting!' 
line 13294=>     But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, 
line 13295=>and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope  behind  the 
line 13296=>hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view.  
line 13297=>The  air  grew warmer between the green walls of hillside  and hillside, and 
line 13298=>the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when 
line 13299=>they reached  the bottom  of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small 
line 13300=>and slender like  a sunlit flower  against the  sky: she  was standing still 
line 13301=>watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked 
line 13302=>she gave a  clear  call,  and lifting  up  her hand she turned  and vanished 
line 13303=>behind the hill. 
line 13304=>     Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet 
line 13305=>of a steep hill into  another deeper and  broader  valley, and then over the 
line 13306=>shoulder of further hills, and down their long  limbs, and  up  their smooth 
line 13307=>sides again, up on to  new hill -tops and down into new valleys. There was no 
line 13308=>tree  nor any visible water: it  was a country  of  grass  and short springy 
line 13309=>turf, silent  except for the whisper of the air over the edges  of the land, 
line 13310=>
line 13311=>####-and high lonely cries of  strange birds.  As they journeyed the sun mounted,  
line 13312=>and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown 
line 13313=>less. When they caught a  glimpse of the country westward the distant  Forest 
line 13314=>seemed to be  smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf 
line 13315=>and root and mould.  A shadow now lay round the edge of  sight, a dark  haze 
line 13316=>above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy. 
line 13317=>     About mid-day  they  came to  a hill whose top  was wide and flattened, 
line 13318=>like a shallow  saucer with a  green mounded rim. Inside  there was  no  air 
line 13319=>stirring,  and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode  across and looked  
line 13320=>northwards. Then  their hearts rose,  for it seemed plain that they had come 
line 13321=>further already than they had expected. Certainly the distances  had now all 
line 13322=>become hazy and deceptive, but there could  be no doubt that  the Downs were 
line 13323=>coming to  an end. A  long valley  la y below  them winding  away northwards,  
line 13324=>until it  came  to  an opening  between two  steep shoulders. Beyond,  there 
line 13325=>seemed  to be  no more hills. Due north  they faintly glimpsed  a  long dark 
line 13326=>line. That is a line  of trees,' said Merry, 'and that must mark  the  Road. 
line 13327=>All  along it for many leagues  east of the Bridge there are  trees growing. 
line 13328=>Some say they were planted in the old days.' 
line 13329=>     'Splendid!'  said Frodo. 'If we make as good going this afternoon as we 
line 13330=>have done this morning, we shall have left  the Downs before the Sun sets and 
line 13331=>be jogging on in search of a camping place.'  But even as he spoke he turned 
line 13332=>his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and 
line 13333=>looked down  upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green  mounds,  
line 13334=>and on some were standing  stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of 
line 13335=>green gums.  
line 13336=>     That view was somehow disquieting; so they  turned  from  the sight and  
line 13337=>went down into  the hollow circle. In  the  midst of it there stood a single 
line 13338=>stone, standing  tall  under  the  sun above,  and at this hour  casting  no 
line 13339=>shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding 
line 13340=>finger, or more like  a  warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun  was 
line 13341=>still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of 
line 13342=>the stone. It was cool,  as if the sun had  had no power to warm  it; but at 
line 13343=>that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink,  and made as 
line 13344=>good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for  the food came 
line 13345=>from 'down under Hill'. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of 
line 13346=>the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.  
line 13347=>     Riding over  the hills,  and eating  their fill, the warm  sun and  the 
line 13348=>
line 13349=>####-scent  of  turf,  lying a little  too long, stretching  out  their legs  and 
line 13350=>looking at the sky above their noses: these things are,  perhaps,  enough to 
line 13351=>explain  what  happened.  However,  that  may  be:  they  woke  suddenly and 
line 13352=>uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant  to take. The standing stone 
line 13353=>was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward  over them. 
line 13354=>The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming  through the mist just above 
line 13355=>the  west wall  of the  hollow  in which  they lay; north, south, and  east, 
line 13356=>beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy 
line 13357=>and  chill. Their ponies  were standing  crowded together  with their  heads 
line 13358=>down. 
line 13359=>     The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm,  and ran to the western rim. 
line 13360=>They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out 
line 13361=>in  dismay  towards the setting sun, it sank before their  eyes into a white 
line 13362=>sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog  rolled up 
line 13363=>to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads 
line 13364=>until  it  became a roof: they were shut  in a  hall of  mist  whose central 
line 13365=>pillar was the standing stone. 
line 13366=>     They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but  they did  not quite 
line 13367=>lose heart. They still remembered  the hopeful view they had had of the line  
line 13368=>of the Road ahead,  and they still knew in  which direction it  lay. In  any 
line 13369=>case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place  about the stone 
line 13370=>that no  thought  of remaining there  was in their minds.  They packed up as 
line 13371=>quickly as their chilled fingers would work. 
line 13372=>     Soon  they were leading their ponies  in single file  over the  rim and 
line 13373=>down the long northward slope of  the hill,  down into a foggy sea. As  they 
line 13374=>went down the mist  became colder  and damper, and their hair hung lank  and 
line 13375=>dripping  on  their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it  was so  cold  
line 13376=>that  they halted  and got out cloaks and  hoods, which soon became  bedewed 
line 13377=>with  grey drops. Then, mounting  their ponies,  they went  sl owly on again,  
line 13378=>feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. They were steering, as 
line 13379=>well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end 
line 13380=>of  the  long valley which  they  had  seen in the  morning.  Once they were 
line 13381=>through the  gap, they had only lo keep on in  anything like a straight line 
line 13382=>and they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go 
line 13383=>beyond that, except for a vague hope  that  perhaps  away  beyond the  Downs 
line 13384=>there might be no fog. 
line 13385=>     Their going  was  very slow.  To  prevent their  getting separated  and 
line 13386=>
line 13387=>####-wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam 
line 13388=>was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley 
line 13389=>seemed 
line 13390=>to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign.  On  either side 
line 13391=>ahead a darkness began  to loom  through  the mist; and he guessed that they 
line 13392=>were  at  last  approaching  the gap in  the hills,  the north-gate  of  the 
line 13393=>Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free. 
line 13394=>     'Come on! Follow me!' he called back over  his shoulder, and he hurried 
line 13395=>forward.  But  his  hope soon  changed  to bewilderment and alarm. The  dark 
line 13396=>patches  grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous 
line 13397=>before him and leaning  slightly towards one another like the pillars  of  a  
line 13398=>headless door, two huge  standing  stones. He could not remember having seen 
line 13399=>any sign  of  these in the  valley, when  he looked out from the hill in the 
line 13400=>morning. He had passed  between them almost before he was aware: and even 
line 13401=>as 
line 13402=>he did so  darkness seemed to  fall round him. His pony  reared and snorted,  
line 13403=>and he  fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others 
line 13404=>had not followed him. 'Sam!' he  called.  'Pippin!  Merry! Come  along!  Why 
line 13405=>don't you keep up?' 
line 13406=>     There was no answer. Fear  took him,  and he ran back  past the  stones 
line 13407=>shouting  wildly: 'Sam!  Sam! Merry! Pippin!' The pony bolted into  the mist  
line 13408=>and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: 
line 13409=>'Hoy!  Frodo! Hoy!' It was away eastward, on his left as he stood  under the 
line 13410=>great  stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off  in  the 
line 13411=>direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill. 
line 13412=>     As he struggled  on he called again,  and kept on calling more and more 
line 13413=>frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and then it  seemed faint 
line 13414=>and far ahead  and high above him. 'Frodo! Hoy!' came the thin voices out of 
line 13415=>the  mist:  and then  a cry that sounded  like  help, help!  often repeated, 
line 13416=>ending  with a  last help!  that trailed off into a  long wail  suddenly cut 
line 13417=>short.  He stumbled forward  with all the speed he could towards  the cries;  
line 13418=>but the light was now gone, and clinging night had closed about him, so that 
line 13419=>it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time  to be 
line 13420=>climbing up and up. 
line 13421=>     Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he  
line 13422=>at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was  weary, sweating  and yet 
line 13423=>chilled. It was wholly dark. 
line 13424=>
line 13425=>####-     'Where are you?' he cried out miserably. 
line 13426=>     There was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware  that  it 
line 13427=>was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy  
line 13428=>wind. A change was coming in the weather. The mist  was flowing  past him 
line 13429=>now 
line 13430=>in shreds and  tatters. His breath was smoking, and  the darkness  was  less 
line 13431=>near and  thick. He looked up  and saw with  surprise  that faint stars were 
line 13432=>appearing  overhead amid the  strands of hurrying cloud  and  fog.  The wind 
line 13433=>began to hiss over the grass.  
line 13434=>     He imagined suddenly that he  caught a muffled cry, and he made towards 
line 13435=>it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and 
line 13436=>the  starry sky  was  unveiled.  A glance showed him  that he was now  facing 
line 13437=>southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must  have climbed from the 
line 13438=>north.  Out  of the east  the  biting wind was blowing. To his  right  there 
line 13439=>loomed against the westward stars a dark  black  shape. A great barrow stood 
line 13440=>there. 
line 13441=>     'Where are you?' he cried again, both angry and afraid. 
line 13442=>     'Here!'  said a voice, deep and cold,  that seemed  to come out of  the 
line 13443=>ground. 'I am waiting for you!' 
line 13444=>     'No!' said Frodo; but  he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell 
line 13445=>on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he 
line 13446=>looked 
line 13447=>up,  in time to see a tall dark  figure like a shadow against the stars.  It 
line 13448=>leaned over him. He thought there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a 
line 13449=>pale light  that seemed to come from  some  remote  distance.  Then  a  grip 
line 13450=>stronger and colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and 
line 13451=>he remembered no more. 
line 13452=>     When  he came to  himself again, for a  moment he could  recall nothing 
line 13453=>except a sense  of  dread. Then  suddenly  he  knew  that he was imprisoned, 
line 13454=>caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A  Barrow-wight had taken him, and he 
line 13455=>was probably already under the  dreadful  spells of  the Barrow-wights about 
line 13456=>which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself: 
line 13457=>flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast. 
line 13458=>     But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part  of the very 
line 13459=>darkness that was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about Bilbo 
line 13460=>Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the 
line 13461=>Shire and  talking about roads and adventures.  There  is  a seed of courage 
line 13462=>
line 13463=>####-hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid 
line 13464=>hobbit, wailing for some final  and desperate danger to  make it grow. Frodo 
line 13465=>was neither  very  fat nor very  timid; indeed,  though he did not  know it, 
line 13466=>Bilbo (and Gandalf) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought 
line 13467=>he had come to the end of his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought 
line 13468=>hardened him.  He found himself stiffening,  as if for a final spring; he no 
line 13469=>longer felt limp like a helpless prey. 
line 13470=>     As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all 
line 13471=>at once  that the darkness was slowly giving way:  a pale greenish light was 
line 13472=>growing round him. It did not  at first show him what kind of a place he was 
line 13473=>in, for the light  seemed to be  coming out of himself,  and from  the floor  
line 13474=>beside  him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He  turned, and there 
line 13475=>in  the  cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were 
line 13476=>on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale;  and they were  clad in 
line 13477=>white. About them lay many treasures, of  gold maybe,  though in that  light  
line 13478=>they  looked cold and unlovely.  On their  heads  were circlets, gold  chains 
line 13479=>were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by  
line 13480=>their sides, and shields were  at their feet. But across their  three  necks 
line 13481=>lay one long naked sword. 
line 13482=>     Suddenly a  song began: a cold  murmur, rising and  falling.  The voice 
line 13483=>seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, 
line 13484=>sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad 
line 13485=>but horrible sounds, strings  of words would now and again shape  themselves:  
line 13486=>grim,  hard,  cold  words,  heartless and miserable. The night  was  railing 
line 13487=>against the morning of  which it was bereaved,  and the cold was cursing the 
line 13488=>warmth for which it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while 
line 13489=>the song became clearer, and  with  dread in  his heart he perceived that it 
line 13490=>had changed into an incantation: 
line 13491=>     Cold be hand and heart and bone, 
line 13492=>     and cold be sleep under stone: 
line 13493=>     never mare to wake on stony bed, 
line 13494=>     never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead. 
line 13495=>     In the black wind the stars shall die, 
line 13496=>     and still on gold here let them lie, 
line 13497=>     till the dark lord lifts his hand 
line 13498=>     over dead sea and withered land. 
line 13499=>     He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself 
line 13500=>
line 13501=>####-on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind 
line 13502=>of  passage which  behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long  arm 
line 13503=>was groping, walking on its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest,  and 
line 13504=>towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him. 
line 13505=>     At first Frodo felt as if he  had indeed been turned into stone by  the 
line 13506=>incantation.  Then a wild thought  of escape came to him. He wondered if  he 
line 13507=>put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight  would miss him, and he might find 
line 13508=>some way ou t.  He thought  of himself running free  over the grass, grieving 
line 13509=>for Merry, and Sam,  and Pippin,  but free and alive  himself. Gandalf would  
line 13510=>admit that there had been nothing else he could do. 
line 13511=>     But the courage that had been  awakened in  him was now   too strong: he 
line 13512=>could not  leave his friends so easily.  He wavered, groping  in his pocket, 
line 13513=>and then fought with himself again; and as he did so  the arm  crept nearer. 
line 13514=>Suddenly  resolve  hardened  in him,  and  he seized a  short sword that lay 
line 13515=>beside him, and kneeling he stooped  low over the bodies of  his companions.  
line 13516=>With what strength he had he hewed  at the crawling  arm near the wrist, and 
line 13517=>the hand broke off; but at the  same moment the sword  splintered up to  the  
line 13518=>hilt.  There  was a shriek and the light vanished. In  the  dark there was a  
line 13519=>snarling noise. 
line 13520=>     Frodo fell  forward over Merry, and Merry's face felt cold. All at once 
line 13521=>back  into  his mind, from which it had disappeared with the first coming of 
line 13522=>the  fog,  came the  memory  of the house down  under the Hill,  and  of Tom 
line 13523=>singing. He remembered  the rhyme  that  Tom  had taught  them. In  a  small 
line 13524=>desperate voice  he began: Ho!  Tom  Bombadil!  and with that name his voice 
line 13525=>seemed to grow  strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber  
line 13526=>echoed as if to drum and trumpet. 
line 13527=>     Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! 
line 13528=>     By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,  
line 13529=>     By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us! 
line 13530=>     Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us! 
line 13531=>     There  was a sudden deep  silence, in which Frodo could hear his  heart 
line 13532=>beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was 
line 13533=>coming down through the  ground or through thick walls,  an  answering voice 
line 13534=>singing: 
line 13535=>     Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,  
line 13536=>     Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.  
line 13537=>     None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master: 
line 13538=>
line 13539=>####-     His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster. 
line 13540=>     There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and  falling, and 
line 13541=>suddenly  light  streamed  in,  real  light, the plain light of  day.  A low 
line 13542=>door -like opening appeared  at the end of the  chamber beyond  Frodo's feet;  
line 13543=>and there was Tom's head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of 
line 13544=>the sun  rising red  behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the 
line 13545=>faces of the three  hobbits lying beside Frodo. They  did not stir,  but the 
line 13546=>sickly hue had left them. They  looked now as  if they were only very deeply  
line 13547=>asleep. 
line 13548=>     Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:  
line 13549=>     Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight! 
line 13550=>     Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing, 
line 13551=>     Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains! 
line 13552=>     Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty! 
line 13553=>     Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness, 
line 13554=>     Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended. 
line 13555=>     At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber  
line 13556=>fell in  with a crash.  Then  there was  a long trailing shriek, fading away 
line 13557=>into an unguessable distance; and after that silence. 
line 13558=>     'Come, friend Frodo!' said Tom. 'Let us get out on to clean  grass! You  
line 13559=>must help me bear them.' 
line 13560=>     Together  they  carried  out Merry, Pippin, and Sam.  As Frodo left the 
line 13561=>barrow  for the last  time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still, 
line 13562=>like  a wounded  spider, in a heap of fallen  earth. Tom went back in again, 
line 13563=>and there was a sound of much thumping and stamping. When he came out he 
line 13564=>was 
line 13565=>bearing in  his  arms a  great  load of  treasure:  things  of  gold, silver, 
line 13566=>copper, and bronze; many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He 
line 13567=>climbed 
line 13568=>the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine. 
line 13569=>     There he stood, with his hat in his hand  and the wind in his hair, and 
line 13570=>looked down upon the  three hobbits, that had been  laid on their backs upon 
line 13571=>the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a  
line 13572=>clear and commanding voice: 
line 13573=>     Wake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling! 
line 13574=>     Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen; 
line 13575=>     Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken. 
line 13576=>
line 13577=>####-     Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open! 
line 13578=>     To Frodo's great joy the hobbits  stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed 
line 13579=>their eyes, and  then suddenly  sprang up. They  looked  about in amazement, 
line 13580=>first  at Frodo, and then at Tom standing  large  as life on  the barrow-top 
line 13581=>above  them; and then  at  themselves in their thin  white rags, crowned and 
line 13582=>belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets.  
line 13583=>     'What in  the name of  wonder?' began Merry, feeling the golden circlet 
line 13584=>that had slipped over  one  eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his 
line 13585=>face, and he closed his eyes. 'Of course, I remember!' he  said. 'The men of 
line 13586=>Carn  Dym came on  us at  night,  and  we were worsted. Ah! the spear  in my 
line 13587=>heart!'  He  clutched at his  breast. 'No! No!'  he said,  opening his eyes.  
line 13588=>'What am I saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?' 
line 13589=>     'I thought that I  was lost,' said Frodo; 'but I don't want to speak of 
line 13590=>it. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!' 
line 13591=>     'Dressed up like this, sir?' said Sam. 'Where are my clothes?' He flung 
line 13592=>his circlet, belt, and  rings on the grass, and looked round helplessly,  as 
line 13593=>if  he  expected  to  find  his  cloak,  jacket,  and  breeches,  and  other  
line 13594=>hobbit-garments lying somewhere to hand. 
line 13595=>     'You won't find  your clothes again,' said  Tom, bounding down from the 
line 13596=>mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the  sunlight. One would have 
line 13597=>thought  that  nothing dangerous  or dreadful  had happened;  and indeed the 
line 13598=>horror faded  out of their  hearts as they looked at him, and saw the  merry 
line 13599=>glint in his eyes. 
line 13600=>     'What do you mean?' asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half 
line 13601=>amused. 'Why not?' 
line 13602=>     But Tom shook his  head, saying: 'You've found yourselves again, out of 
line 13603=>the deep water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be 
line 13604=>glad,  my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heal now  heart and limb!  
line 13605=>Cast off these cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a -hunting!' 
line 13606=>     He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him 
line 13607=>Frodo saw him  running away southwards along the green  hollow between 
line 13608=>their 
line 13609=>hill and the next, still whistling and crying: 
line 13610=>     Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander? 
line 13611=>     Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder? 
line 13612=>     Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin, 
line 13613=>     White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin! 
line 13614=>
line 13615=>####-     So he sang, running fast, tossi ng up his hat  and catching it, until he 
line 13616=>was hidden  by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now! 
line 13617=>came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south. 
line 13618=>     The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran  about for a while 
line 13619=>on the grass,  as he  told them. Then they lay basking  in the  sun with the 
line 13620=>delight of  those  that have been wafted  suddenly  from bitter winter to  a  
line 13621=>friendly clime, or of people that, after  being long ill and bedridden, wake 
line 13622=>one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of 
line 13623=>promise. 
line 13624=>     By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He 
line 13625=>reappeared, hat first, over  the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an 
line 13626=>obedient line six  ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly 
line 13627=>old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger,  fatter  (and older)  than their 
line 13628=>own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them 
line 13629=>any such names, but they answered  to the  new names that Tom had given 
line 13630=>them 
line 13631=>for the rest of  their  lives. Tom called  them one by  one and they climbed 
line 13632=>over the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.  
line 13633=>     'Here are your ponies, now!' he  said.  'They've  more  sense (in  some 
line 13634=>ways) than you  wandering hobbits have  - more sense in their noses. For they 
line 13635=>sniff  danger ahead which  you walk  right  into; and if  they  run to  save 
line 13636=>themselves, then they run  the  right  way.  You must forgive  them all; for  
line 13637=>though their hearts are faithful,  to  face fear of Barrow-wights is not what 
line 13638=>they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!' 
line 13639=>     Merry, Sam,  and Pippin now clothed themselves  in spare  garments from 
line 13640=>their  packs; and they soon felt too hot, for  they  were  obliged to put on 
line 13641=>some  of  the thicker  and warmer things  that they had  brought against the 
line 13642=>oncoming of winter. 
line 13643=>     'Where  does  that other old  animal, that  Fatty  Lumpkin, come from?' 
line 13644=>asked Frodo. 
line 13645=>     'He's mine,' said  Tom. 'My four-legged  friend;  though I seldom  ride 
line 13646=>him,  and he wanders  often far, free upon the  hillsides. When  your ponies 
line 13647=>stayed with  me, they  got  to know  my Lumpkin;  and they  smelt him in the 
line 13648=>night,  and quickly  ran to meet him. I thought he'd  look for them and with 
line 13649=>his words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old 
line 13650=>Tom's going to ride. Hey! he's coming with you, just to set you on the road; 
line 13651=>so  he needs a pony. For you  cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, 
line 13652=>
line 13653=>####-when you're on your own legs trying to trot beside them.' 
line 13654=>     The hobbits were delighted  to  hear this, and thanked  Tom many times;  
line 13655=>but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he  
line 13656=>would  not  feel happy till he had seen them  safe over  the borders  of  his 
line 13657=>land. 'I've got  things to  do,' he  said:  'my  making and  my  singing, my 
line 13658=>talking and my walking, and my watching of the country.  Tom can't be always 
line 13659=>near  to  open doors  and willow-cracks.  Tom  has  his house  to mind,  and  
line 13660=>Goldberry is wait ing.' 
line 13661=>     It was still fairly early  by the sun, something between  nine and ten, 
line 13662=>and the hobbits turned their minds  to food. Their last meal  had been lunch 
line 13663=>beside  the  standing  stone the  day  before. They  breakfasted now off the 
line 13664=>remainder of  Tom's provisions,  meant for their supper, with additions that 
line 13665=>Tom had brought with him. It was  not a large meal (considering hobbits  and 
line 13666=>the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating 
line 13667=>Tom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures. Most of these he 
line 13668=>made into a pile that glistened and  sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie 
line 13669=>there 'free to  all finders,  birds, beasts. Elves  or Men,  and  all kindly 
line 13670=>creatures'; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and 
line 13671=>no Wight  ever  come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch  
line 13672=>set  with  blue  stones,  many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue 
line 13673=>butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his 
line 13674=>head, and saying at last:  
line 13675=>     'Here is a pretty toy for  Tom and for his  lady! Fair was she who long 
line 13676=>ago  wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear it now, and we will not 
line 13677=>forget her!' 
line 13678=>     For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, 
line 13679=>of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. 
line 13680=>They 
line 13681=>gleamed as he drew them  from their black sheaths,  wrought of  some strange 
line 13682=>metal,  light and  strong, and set with  many fiery stones.  Whether by some 
line 13683=>virtue in these sheaths or  because of the spell  that lay on the mound, the 
line 13684=>blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun. 
line 13685=>     'Old  knives are long  enough  as  swords for  hobbit-people,' he said. 
line 13686=>'Sharp  blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking , east,  south,  or  
line 13687=>far away into dark  and danger.'  Then he told  them that these  blades were 
line 13688=>forged many long years ago by Men of Westernesse: they were foes of the 
line 13689=>Dark 
line 13690=>
line 13691=>####-Lord,  but  they were overcome  by the evil king of Carn Dym in  the Land of 
line 13692=>Angmar . 
line 13693=>     'Few now remember them,' Tom murmured,  'yet  still some  go wandering, 
line 13694=>sons of forgotten  kings walking in loneliness,  guarding  from  evil things 
line 13695=>folk that are heedless.' 
line 13696=>     The hobbits  did not understand his  words, but as  he spoke they had a 
line 13697=>vision  as it  were of a  great expanse of  years  behind them,  like a vast  
line 13698=>shadowy  plain over  which there strode  shapes  of Men, tall and grim  with 
line 13699=>bright swords,  and last came  one with a star on his  brow. Then the vision 
line 13700=>faded,  and they were back  in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. 
line 13701=>They made ready,  packing  their  bags  and lading  their  ponies. Their new 
line 13702=>weapons they hung on their  leather belts under  their jackets, feeling them 
line 13703=>very awkward, and  wondering  if they would be of  any use. Fighting had not 
line 13704=>before occurred to any of  them  as one  of the  adventures  in which  their 
line 13705=>flight would land them. 
line 13706=>     At last  they  set off. They led their ponies down the hill;  and  then 
line 13707=>mounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back and saw the 
line 13708=>top of the old mound on the hill, and  from it the sunlight on the gold went 
line 13709=>up like a yellow flame. Then they turned  a shoulder of the Downs and it was 
line 13710=>hidden from view.  
line 13711=>     Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great 
line 13712=>stones standing like  a gate, and before long they came to the  northern gap 
line 13713=>and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry 
line 13714=>journey with  Tom Bombadil trotting gaily  beside them, or  before  them, on 
line 13715=>Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom  
line 13716=>sang 
line 13717=>most of the time, but  it  was chiefly  nonsense, or else  perhaps a strange 
line 13718=>language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were 
line 13719=>mainly 
line 13720=>those of wonder and delight. 
line 13721=>     They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further  
line 13722=>away  than  they  had  imagined. Even without a fog,  their sleep at mid-day 
line 13723=>would have prevented them from reaching it  until after nightfall on the day 
line 13724=>before.  The dark line they had seen was  not  a line of trees but a line of 
line 13725=>bushes growing on the edge  of a deep dike with  a steep wall on the further  
line 13726=>side.  Tom said that it had once been  the boundary of a kingdom, but a very 
line 13727=>long lime ago. He seemed to remember  something sad about it, and would  not 
line 13728=>
line 13729=>####-say much. 
line 13730=>     They climbed down  and out  of the dike and through a gap  in the wall, 
line 13731=>and then  Tom turned due north, for they  had been  bearing  somewhat to the 
line 13732=>west. The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, 
line 13733=>but  the  sun was already sinking low when at  last  they saw a line of tall 
line 13734=>trees  ahead,  and they knew that they had come back  to the Road after many 
line 13735=>unexpected adventures.  They galloped their ponies  over  the last furlongs,  
line 13736=>and halted u nder the long shadows of the trees. They  were on  the  top of a  
line 13737=>sloping bank,  and  the Road,  now dim as evening drew on, wound away  
line 13738=>below 
line 13739=>them. At this point  it ran nearly  from South-west  to North-east,  and  on 
line 13740=>their right it  fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore 
line 13741=>many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes  full of 
line 13742=>water. They rode down the  bank and looked up and down. There was nothing 
line 13743=>to 
line 13744=>be  seen. 'Well,  here we  are again at  last!'  said  Frodo.  'I suppose  we 
line 13745=>haven't  lost more than two days  by  my short  cut through the Forest!  But 
line 13746=>perhaps the delay will prove useful  - it may have put them off our trail.' 
line 13747=>     The others looked at  him.  The shadow of the fear of the  Black Riders 
line 13748=>came suddenly over them  again. Ever since they had entered  the Forest they 
line 13749=>had thought chiefly of getting back  to  the  Road;  only  now  when it  lay 
line 13750=>beneath their feet  did they remember the danger which pursued them, and was 
line 13751=>more than likely  to be  lying in wait for  them upon the Road  itself. They 
line 13752=>looked anxiously back towards the setting sun,  but  the Road was  brown and 
line 13753=>empty. 
line 13754=>     'Do you  think,'  asked Pippin hesitatingly,  'do you  think we may  be 
line 13755=>pursued, tonight?' 
line 13756=>     'No, I hope not  tonight,' answered Tom Bombadil; 'nor perhaps the next 
line 13757=>day. But do not trust my guess; for I  cannot tell  for certain. Out east my 
line 13758=>knowledge fails. Tom is not master of  Riders from the Black Land far beyond 
line 13759=>his country.' 
line 13760=>     All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that 
line 13761=>he would know how to deal with Black Riders,  if anyone did. They would 
line 13762=>soon 
line 13763=>now  be going forward  into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but 
line 13764=>the  most  vague and  distant  legends  of the Shire, and in  the  gathering 
line 13765=>twilight they longed for home. A  deep  loneliness and sense  of loss was on  
line 13766=>
line 13767=>####-them.  They stood  silent,  reluctant to make  the final  parting, and  only 
line 13768=>slowly  became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to 
line 13769=>have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting. 
line 13770=>     'Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over  (after that your 
line 13771=>own  luck must go with you and  guide you): four miles along the Road you'll 
line 13772=>come  upon a village,  Bree under Bree -hill, with  doors  looking  westward.  
line 13773=>There you'll  find an  old inn that  is  called The  Prancing Pony. Barliman 
line 13774=>Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There you can stay the night, and afterwards 
line 13775=>the morning  will speed you upon your way.  Be  bold, but wary! Keep up your 
line 13776=>merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!' 
line 13777=>     They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and  drink once more 
line 13778=>with them; but he laughed and refused, saying: 
line 13779=>     Tom's country ends here: he will not pass the borders. 
line 13780=>     Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting! 
line 13781=>     Then  he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin's  back, and rode 
line 13782=>up over the bank and away singing into the dusk. 
line 13783=>     The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight. 
line 13784=>     'I  am sorry  to  take  leave of  Master  Bombadil,' said Sam.  'He's a  
line 13785=>caution and  no mistake.  I  reckon  we may go  a  good deal further and see 
line 13786=>naught  better,  nor queerer. But  I  won't deny I'll be  glad to  see  this 
line 13787=>Prancing  Pony he spoke of. I hope  it'll be like The Green Dragon away back  
line 13788=>home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?' 
line 13789=>     'There  are  hobbits in Bree,'  said Merry,  'as well as  Big  Folk.  I 
line 13790=>daresay it will be homelike  enough. The Pony is a good inn by all accounts.  
line 13791=>My people ride out there now and again.' 
line 13792=>     'It may be all we could wish,' said Frodo; 'but it is outside the Shire 
line 13793=>all the same. Don't  make yourselves  too much at home! Please remember -all 
line 13794=>of you - that the name of Baggins must NOT be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, 
line 13795=>if any name must be given.' 
line 13796=>     They now mounted  their ponies and rode off  silently into the evening. 
line 13797=>Darkness came down quickly,  as they  plodded slowly  downhill and up again, 
line 13798=>until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead. 
line 13799=>     Before  them rose Bree-hill barring the way,  a dark mass against misty 
line 13800=>stars; and under  its western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they 
line 13801=>now  hurried desiring only to find a fire,  and a door  between them and the 
line 13802=>night. 
line 13803=> 
line 13804=>
line 13805=>####- 
line 13806=>
line 13807=>Chapter 9. At the Sign of 
line 13808=>
line 13809=> 
line 13810=> 
line 13811=>     The Prancing Pony 
line 13812=>     Bree was the chief village of  the Bree-land, a small inhabited region, 
line 13813=>like an island in the empty  lands round about. Besides  Bree  itself, there 
line 13814=>was Staddle on the  other side of the hill, Combe  in a deep valley a little 
line 13815=>further eastward,  and  Archet  on  the  edge of  the Chetwood.  Lying round 
line 13816=>Bree-hill and the  villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland  
line 13817=>only a few miles broad. 
line 13818=>     The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad,  and  rather  short, cheerful 
line 13819=>and independent: they belonged to  nobody but themselves; but they were more 
line 13820=>friendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and other inhabitants of 
line 13821=>the world  about them than was (or  is)  usual with Big People. According to 
line 13822=>their own tales  they were the original inhabitants and wer e the descendants 
line 13823=>of the first Men that ever wandered  into the West of the  middle-world. Few 
line 13824=>had survived the turmoils of  the Elder  Days; but  when the  Kings returned 
line 13825=>again over the  Great Sea  they had found the Bree-men still there, and they 
line 13826=>were st ill there now, when the memory  of  the  old Kings had faded into the 
line 13827=>grass. 
line 13828=>     In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within 
line 13829=>a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands beyond Bree there were 
line 13830=>mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing 
line 13831=>of 
line 13832=>their origin. They  were  taller and darker  than the  Men of Bree  and were 
line 13833=>believed  to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the 
line 13834=>languages of beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards 
line 13835=>even as far as  the Misty  Mountains; but they were now few and rarely seen. 
line 13836=>When  they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange  forgotten 
line 13837=>tales which were eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends 
line 13838=>of them. 
line 13839=>     There were  also many families  of hobbits  in the  Bree-land  and they 
line 13840=>claimed to be  the oldest  settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that  was 
line 13841=>founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed and the Shire colonized. 
line 13842=>They  lived  mostly  in  Staddle though  there were  some  in  Bree  itself,  
line 13843=>especially on the  higher slopes of the hill, above the  houses of  the Men. 
line 13844=>
line 13845=>####-The  Big  Folk and  the  Little Folk  (as they  called one another) were  on  
line 13846=>friendly  terms,  minding their  own affairs in  their own  ways,  but  both 
line 13847=>rightly regarding  themselves as  necessary parts of the Bree-folk.  Nowhere 
line 13848=>else in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found. 
line 13849=>     The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did  not themselves travel much; and the 
line 13850=>affairs  of the  four villages  were their  chief concern. Occasionally  the 
line 13851=>Hobbits  of Bree went as far as  Buckland, or the  Eastfarthing; but  though 
line 13852=>their  link land  was not  much  further  than a  day's  riding  east of the 
line 13853=>Brandywine Bridge,  the  Hobbits  of the Shire  now seldom  visited  it.  An 
line 13854=>occasional Bucklander or  adventurous Took would come  out to  the Inn for a  
line 13855=>night  or  two, but  even  that  was  becoming  less  and  less  usual.  The 
line 13856=>Shire-hobbits referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond 
line 13857=>the  borders,   as  Outsiders,  and  took  very  little  interest  in  them, 
line 13858=>considering them dull  and uncouth. There were probably  many more 
line 13859=>Outsiders 
line 13860=>scattered about in the West  of the World in those days than  the  people of 
line 13861=>the Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were no  better than  tramps, ready  to  
line 13862=>dig a hole in any bank and  stay only as long as it suited them.  But in the 
line 13863=>Bree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and  prosperous, and no more 
line 13864=>rustic tha n most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten 
line 13865=>that there had been a time when there was much coming and going  between 
line 13866=>the 
line 13867=>Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts.  
line 13868=>     The village of Bree had some  hundred  stone houses  of  the Big  Folk, 
line 13869=>mostly above the Road, nestling  on the hillside with  windows looking west. 
line 13870=>On that side, running in  more  than half a circle from the hill and back to 
line 13871=>it, there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the  inner side.   Over  this 
line 13872=>the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred 
line 13873=>by a great gate. There was another gate in the southern comer where the Road 
line 13874=>ran out of the village. The  gates were closed at nightfall; but just inside 
line 13875=>them were small lodges for the gatekeepers.  
line 13876=>     Down on  the Road, where it swept to the right to  go round the foot of 
line 13877=>the hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long ago when the traffic 
line 13878=>on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways;  
line 13879=>another ancient road  crossed  the  East  Road  just outside (he dike at the 
line 13880=>western end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various 
line 13881=>sorts had travelled much on it. Strange as News from Bree was still a saying 
line 13882=>
line 13883=>####-in the  Eastfarthing, descending from  those days,  when  news  from  North, 
line 13884=>South, and East could be heard in the inn,  and when  the Shire-hobbits used 
line 13885=>to go more often to hear it.  But the Northern Lands had long been desolate,  
line 13886=>and  the  North  Road  was now  seldom  used: it was  grass-grown,  and  the 
line 13887=>Bree-folk called it the Greenway. 
line 13888=>     The Inn  of Bree  was still  there, however, and  the  innkeeper was an 
line 13889=>important person. His house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and 
line 13890=>inquisitive  among the inhabitants, large and  small, of the four  villages;  
line 13891=>and a resort of Rangers and other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly 
line 13892=>dwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains.  
line 13893=>     It  was  dark,  and  white  stars  were  shining,  when  Frodo and  his 
line 13894=>companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near the  village. 
line 13895=>They came to the West -gate and found it shut, but  at the door  of the lodge 
line 13896=>beyond it, there was a man sitting. He jumped up and  fetched a lantern  and 
line 13897=>looked over  the gate at them in surprise. 
line 13898=>     'What do you want, and where do you come from?' he asked gruffly. 
line 13899=>     'We are making for  the inn here,' answered Frodo.  'We are  journeying 
line 13900=>east and cannot go further tonight.' 
line 13901=>     'Hobbits! Four  hobbits! And what's more,  out  of  the Shire  by their 
line 13902=>talk,' said the gatekeeper, softly as if  speaking to himself. He  stared at 
line 13903=>them darkly for a moment, and then slowly  opened the gate and let them ride 
line 13904=>through. 
line 13905=>     'We don't  often see Shire-folk riding on the Road  at  night,' he went 
line 13906=>on, as they halted  a moment by his door. 'You'll pardon  my wondering  what 
line 13907=>business takes you away east of Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?' 
line 13908=>     'Our names and our business are our own,  and this does not seem a good  
line 13909=>place  to  discuss them,' said Frodo, not liking the look of  the man or  the 
line 13910=>tone of his voice. 
line 13911=>     'Your  business is  your  own, no doubt,'  said  the man; 'but it's  my 
line 13912=>business to ask questions after nightfall.' 
line 13913=>     'We  are hobbits  from Buckland, and we have a  fancy to travel and  to 
line 13914=>stay at the  inn here,' put  in Merry. 'I am  Mr. Brandybuck. Is that enough 
line 13915=>for  you?  The Bree-folk used  to be fair-spoken to travellers,  or so I had 
line 13916=>heard.' 
line 13917=>     'All right, all right!' said the man.  'I  meant no offence. But you'll 
line 13918=>find  maybe that more  folk  than old Harry  at the  gate will be asking you  
line 13919=>questions. There's queer folk about. If you go  on to  The Pony, you'll find 
line 13920=>
line 13921=>####-you're oat the only guests.' 
line 13922=>     He wished  them  good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see 
line 13923=>in  the lantern-light  that the  man was still eyeing them curiously. He was 
line 13924=>glad to  hear  the gate clang  to  behind  them,  as they rode  forward.  He 
line 13925=>wondered why the man was  so suspicious, and whether any one had been 
line 13926=>asking 
line 13927=>for news of a party of hobbits. Could  it have been Gandalf? He  might  have 
line 13928=>arrived, while they  were delayed in the Forest and the Downs. But there was 
line 13929=>something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy.  
line 13930=>     The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to  
line 13931=>his house. As soon as his  back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in  
line 13932=>over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street. 
line 13933=>     The  hobbits rode on up a  gentle slope, passing a few detached  houses, 
line 13934=>and  drew up outside the  inn. The houses looked large  and strange to them.  
line 13935=>Sam stared up at the inn  with its three  storeys and many windows, and felt 
line 13936=>his  heart sink. He  had imagined  himself meeting giants taller than trees, 
line 13937=>and other creatures  even more terrifying, some time or other  in the course 
line 13938=>of his journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of  Men and 
line 13939=>their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the dark end of a tiring 
line 13940=>day. He  pictured  black horses standing all  saddled in  the shadows of the 
line 13941=>inn-yard, and Black Riders peering out of dark upper windows. 
line 13942=>     'We  surely aren't going  to stay here for the night,  are we, sir?' he 
line 13943=>exclaimed. 'If there are hobbit-folk  in these  pans, why  don't we look for  
line 13944=>some  that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.' 
line 13945=>     'What's wrong with the inn?' said Frodo. 'Tom Bombadil  recommended it. 
line 13946=>I expect it's homelike enough inside.' 
line 13947=>     Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. 
line 13948=>It had a front on  the Road, and two wings running  back on land partly  cut 
line 13949=>out  of the lower  slopes of the hill, so  that at the rear the second-floor 
line 13950=>windows were level  with the  ground.  There  was a wide  arch  leading to a  
line 13951=>courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was  a  
line 13952=>large doorway reached by  a few  broad  steps. The  door  was open and light 
line 13953=>streamed out of it. Above the arch  there was a lamp, and beneath it swung a  
line 13954=>large signboard: a  fat white pony reared up on  its hind legs. Over the door 
line 13955=>was painted in white letters: THE PRANCING PONY by BARLIMAN  
line 13956=>BUTTERBUR. Many 
line 13957=>of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.  
line 13958=>
line 13959=>####-     As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing  a  merry 
line 13960=>song  inside, and many  cheerful voices  joined loudly in the  chorus.  They 
line 13961=>listened  to  this encouraging sound for a moment and  then  got  off  their 
line 13962=>ponies. The song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping. 
line 13963=>     They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving  them standing in the 
line 13964=>yard they climbed up  the steps. Frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a  
line 13965=>short fat man with a bald head and a red  face. He had a white apron on, and 
line 13966=>was  bustling out of  one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden 
line 13967=>with full mugs.  
line 13968=>     'Can we--' began Frodo. 
line 13969=>     'Half a minute, if  you please!' shouted the man over his shoulder, and 
line 13970=>vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In a moment he was out 
line 13971=>again, wiping his hands on his apron. 
line 13972=>     'Good  evening, little master!' he said, bending down. 'What may you be 
line 13973=>wanting?' 
line 13974=>     'Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies,  if that can be  managed. 
line 13975=>Are you Mr. Butterbur?' 
line 13976=>     'That's right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service!  
line 13977=>You 're from the Shire,  eh?' he said, and  then suddenly he clapped his hand  
line 13978=>to  his forehead, as  if  trying to remember something. 'Hobbits!' he cried. 
line 13979=>'Now what does that remind me of? Might I ask your names, sir?' 
line 13980=>     'Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,' said   Frodo; 'and this is Sam Gamgee. My 
line 13981=>name is Underhill.' 
line 13982=>     'There  now!' said  Mr.  Butterbur,  snapping  his fingers. 'It's  gone 
line 13983=>again! But it'll come back, when I have time to  think. I'm run off my feet; 
line 13984=>but I'll see what I can  do for you. We don't often get a party out  of  the 
line 13985=>Shire nowadays, and I should be sorry not to make you welcome. But  there is 
line 13986=>such  a crowd already in the house  tonight  as there  hasn't been for  long 
line 13987=>enough. It never rains but it pours, we say in Bree. 
line 13988=>     'Hi! Nob!' he shouted. 'Where  are  you, you woolly-footed  slow-coach?  
line 13989=>Nob!' 
line 13990=>     'Coming,  sir! Coming!' A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out  of  a door, 
line 13991=>and  seeing the  travellers, stopped short and stared  at  them  with  great 
line 13992=>interest.  
line 13993=>     'Where's  Bob?'  asked the landlord.  'You don't  know? Well find  him!  
line 13994=>Double sharp! I haven't got six legs, nor six eyes neither! Tell Bob there's 
line 13995=>five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room somehow.' Nob trotted 
line 13996=>
line 13997=>####-off with a grin and a wink. 
line 13998=>     'Well, now, what wa s  I going to  say?' said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his 
line 13999=>forehead. 'One thing drives out another, so to speak. I'm that busy tonight, 
line 14000=>my head is going round. There's  a party that came up the Greenway from 
line 14001=>down 
line 14002=>South last night - and that was strange enough to  begin with. Then there's a  
line 14003=>travelling  company  of dwarves  going  West come  in  this evening. And now 
line 14004=>there's you.  If you weren't  hobbits, I  doubt  if  we could house you. But 
line 14005=>we've  got  a room or two  in the  north wing  that  were made  special  for 
line 14006=>hobbits, when this  place was built.  On  the  ground  floor as they usually 
line 14007=>prefer; round windows and all as they like it. I hope you'll be comfortable. 
line 14008=>You'll be wanting supper, I don't doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!' 
line 14009=>     He led them a short  way  down a passage, and opened a door. 'Here is a  
line 14010=>nice little parlour!' he said. 'I hope it will suit. Excuse me now. I'm that 
line 14011=>busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It's hard  work for two legs,  
line 14012=>but I  don't get thinner. I'll look  in again  la ter.  If you want anything, 
line 14013=>ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he don't come, ring and shout!' 
line 14014=>     Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed 
line 14015=>capable of  an endless stream of talk, however busy he might be. They  found 
line 14016=>themselves in a small and cosy room. There  was a bit of bright fire burning  
line 14017=>on  the hearth,  and in front of it  were some low  and comfortable  chairs.  
line 14018=>There  was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was a  
line 14019=>large hand-bell. But  Nob, the  hobbit servant, came bustling in long before 
line 14020=>they thought of ringing. He brought candles and a tray full of plates.  
line 14021=>     'Will you be wanting anything  to drink, masters?' he asked. 'And shall 
line 14022=>I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready? ' 
line 14023=>     They were  washed and in the middle of good deep mugs  of beer when Mr. 
line 14024=>Butterbur and  Nob  came in again. In a twinkling the table was laid.  There 
line 14025=>was hot soup, cold meats, a  blackberry  tart,  new loaves, slabs of butter, 
line 14026=>and half  a ripe  cheese: good plain food, as good  as the Shire could show, 
line 14027=>and homelike enough to  dispel  the last of  Sam's misgivings (already  much 
line 14028=>relieved by the excellence of the beer). 
line 14029=>     The landlord hovered round for a link, and then prepared to leave them. 
line 14030=>'I don't  know whether  you would care  to  join the company, when  you have 
line 14031=>supped,' he said, standing at the door. 'Perhaps you would rather go to your 
line 14032=>beds. Still the company would be very pleased to welcome you , if  you  had a 
line 14033=>mind.  We don't get  Outsiders  -  travellers from the  Shire, I should  say, 
line 14034=>
line 14035=>####-begging your pardon - often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story 
line 14036=>or song you may have in mind.  But as you please! Ring the bell, if you lack  
line 14037=>anything!' 
line 14038=>     So refreshed and encouraged did  they feel at the end  of  their supper 
line 14039=>(about three quarters of an hour's steady going, not hindered by unnecessary 
line 14040=>talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company. Merry said it  
line 14041=>would be too stuffy. 'I shall sit  here quietly by the fire  for  a bit, and 
line 14042=>perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and  don't  
line 14043=>forget that you are supposed to be  escaping in secret, and are still on the 
line 14044=>high-road and not very far from the Shire!' 
line 14045=>     'All right!' said Pippin. 'Mind yourself!  Don't  get  lost,  and don't  
line 14046=>forget that it is safer indoors!' 
line 14047=>     The company  was in the big common-room  of the inn.  The gathering was 
line 14048=>large  and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got used  to the light. 
line 14049=>This came chiefly from a blazing  log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from 
line 14050=>the  beams were  dim,  and half  veiled  in smoke.  Barliman  Butterbur  was 
line 14051=>standing  near the  fire, talking  to  a couple  of dwarves and one  or  two 
line 14052=>strange-looking  men.  On the benches were  various  folk:  men  of   Bree, a  
line 14053=>collection of local  hobbits  (sitting  chattering  together),  a  few  more 
line 14054=>dwarves,  and other vague figures difficult to make out away  in the shadows 
line 14055=>and comers.  
line 14056=>     As soon as the Shire-hobbits  entered, there  was  a  chorus of welcome 
line 14057=>from the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those that  had come up the 
line 14058=>Greenway, stared at them curiously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to 
line 14059=>the Bree-folk, so  quickly  that, though they caught  many  names, they were 
line 14060=>seldom  sure who the names belonged to.  The Men of Bree seemed  all to have 
line 14061=>rather  botanical (and to the Shire-folk rather odd) names,  like Rushlight, 
line 14062=>Goatleaf,  Heathertoes,  Appledore, Thistlewool and  Ferny (not  to  mention  
line 14063=>Butterbur).  Some  of  the hobbits  had  similar  names.  The  Mugworts, for  
line 14064=>instance,  seemed numerous.  But  most of them  had natural  names,  such as 
line 14065=>Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes,  Sandheaver, and Tunnelly,  many of which 
line 14066=>were 
line 14067=>used  in the Shire.  There were several Underhills  from Saddle, and as they 
line 14068=>could not imagine sharing  a name without being  related, they took Frodo to  
line 14069=>their hearts as a long-lost cousin. 
line 14070=>     The Bree-hobbits were,  in fact, friendly  and  inquisitive,  and Frodo 
line 14071=>soon found that  some  explanation  of  what he was doing would  have  to be 
line 14072=>
line 14073=>####-given. He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which  
line 14074=>there was much wagging of heads, although neither  of these words  were much 
line 14075=>used in the  Bree-dialect). He said  he  was thinking of writing a  book (at 
line 14076=>which there was  silent astonishment), and that he and his friends  wanted to  
line 14077=>collect information about  hobbits living  outside the Shire,  especially in 
line 14078=>the eastern lands. 
line 14079=>     At this  a  chorus of voices broke  out. If Frodo had  really wanted to 
line 14080=>write a  book,  and  had  had  many ears, he  would  have learned enough for  
line 14081=>several chapters  in a few minutes. And if that was not enough, he was given  
line 14082=>a whole list of names, beginning with 'Old Barliman here', to whom he  could 
line 14083=>go for further information. But after a time, a s Frodo did not show any sign 
line 14084=>of writing a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about 
line 14085=>doings in  the Shire. Frodo did not  prove  very communicative,  and he soon 
line 14086=>found himself sitting alone in a comer, listening and looking around. 
line 14087=>     The Men and  Dwarves were mostly talking of  distant events and telling 
line 14088=>flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar. There  was trouble away 
line 14089=>in the South, and it seemed that the  Men who had  come up the Greenway 
line 14090=>were 
line 14091=>on  the  move,  looking for   lands  where they  could  find some  peace. The 
line 14092=>Bree-folk were  sympathetic, but plainly  not  very  ready to  take  a large 
line 14093=>number  of  strangers  into  their little land. One  of  the  travellers,  a  
line 14094=>squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling  that more  and more people 
line 14095=>would  be  coming north in  the near future. 'If  room isn't found for them, 
line 14096=>they'll  find it for  themselves.  They've a  right  to live,  same as other 
line 14097=>folk,'  he said  loudly. The  local inhabitants did not look  pleased at the 
line 14098=>prospect. 
line 14099=>     The hobbits  did not pay much attention to all this,  and it did not at 
line 14100=>the moment seem to concern hobbits. Big  Folk could hardly  beg for lodgings 
line 14101=>in hobbit-holes. They were more  interested in Sam and Pippin,  who were now 
line 14102=>feeling quite  at home, and were chatting  gaily about events in the  Shire. 
line 14103=>Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the 
line 14104=>roof of the Town  Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor,  and the 
line 14105=>fattest hobbit  in the Westfarthing, had  been buried in chalk, and came out 
line 14106=>like a floured  dumpling. But there were several questions asked  that  made 
line 14107=>Frodo a little uneasy. One of  the Bree-landers, who seemed to  have been in 
line 14108=>the Shire  several times, wanted to know where the  Underhills lived and who 
line 14109=>they were related to. 
line 14110=>
line 14111=>####-     Suddenly  Frodo  noticed  that  a  strange-looking  weather -beaten man, 
line 14112=>sitting in  the  shadows near the  wall, was  also listening intently to the 
line 14113=>hobbit-talk. He had  a  tall tankard  in  front of him, and  was  smoking  a  
line 14114=>long-stemmed pipe curiously carved. His legs  were stretched out before him, 
line 14115=>showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much 
line 14116=>wear and were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-
line 14117=>green 
line 14118=>cloth was  drawn  close  about him, and in spite of the heat of the room  he 
line 14119=>wore a hood  that overshadowed his  face; but the gleam of his eyes could be 
line 14120=>seen as he watched the hobbits. 
line 14121=>     'Who is that?' Frodo asked, when he  got  a chance  to  whisper  to Mr. 
line 14122=>Butterbur. 'I don't think you introduced him?' 
line 14123=>     'Him?' said  the  landlord in  an  answering whisper,  cocking  an  eye 
line 14124=>without  turning his head. 'I don't rightly know. He is one of the wandering 
line 14125=>folk -Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare 
line 14126=>tale when he has the mind. He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he 
line 14127=>pops  up again. He was in and out  pretty  often last spring; but I  haven't  
line 14128=>seen  him about lately. What his  right name is I've  never  heard: but he's 
line 14129=>known round here as Strider. Goes  about at a great pace on his long shanks;  
line 14130=>though  he  don't  tell nobody what cause  he has to hurry.  But there's  no 
line 14131=>accounting for East and West, as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the 
line 14132=>Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you  should  ask about  him.' But  at 
line 14133=>that moment Mr. Butterbur was called away  by a demand for more ale  and his 
line 14134=>last remark remained unexplained. 
line 14135=>     Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he  had heard or  
line 14136=>guessed  all that had been said.  Presently,  with a wave of his hand and  a  
line 14137=>nod, he invited Frodo to come over  and sit  by  him. As  Frodo drew near be  
line 14138=>threw back his  hood, showing  a shaggy head of dark hair  necked with grey, 
line 14139=>and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes.  
line 14140=>     'I  am called Strider,'  he said  in a low voice. 'I am very pleased to 
line 14141=>meet you. Master - Underhill, if old Butterbur got your name right.' 
line 14142=>     'He  did,' said  Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under  the 
line 14143=>stare of those keen eyes.  
line 14144=>     'Well, Master Underhill,' said Strider,  'if I were  you, I should stop 
line 14145=>your  young friends  from talking too much. Drink , fire,  and chance-meeting 
line 14146=>are pleasant enough, but, well - this  isn't the Shire. There are queer folk  
line 14147=>about. Though I  say it as shouldn't, you may  think,'  he  added with a wry 
line 14148=>
line 14149=>####-smile, seeing Frodo's glance. 'And  there have been even stranger travellers 
line 14150=>through Bree lately,' he went on, watching Frodo's face. 
line 14151=>     Frodo returned his  gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no  further  
line 14152=>sign.  His  attention  seemed  suddenly to be fixed on Pippin.  To his alarm 
line 14153=>Frodo became aware that the ridiculous young Took, encouraged by his success 
line 14154=>with  the fat  Mayor of  Michel  Delving, was  now actually  giving a  comic 
line 14155=>account of Bilbo's farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the 
line 14156=>Speech, and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance. 
line 14157=>     Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most  of the local 
line 14158=>hobbits, no doubt: just a  funny story about  those funny people away beyond 
line 14159=>the River;  but some (old Butterbur, for instance)  knew a thing or two, and 
line 14160=>had probably heard rumours long ago about  Bilbo's vanishing. It would bring 
line 14161=>the name of Baggins to their minds,  especially  if there had been inquiries 
line 14162=>in Bree after that name. 
line 14163=>     Frodo  fidgeted,  wondering  what to  do.  Pippin  was  evidently  much 
line 14164=>enjoying  the attention he was getting,  and had  become  quite forgetful of 
line 14165=>their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even 
line 14166=>mention the Ring; and that might well be disastrous.  
line 14167=>     'You had better do something quick!' whispered Strider in his ear. 
line 14168=>     Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to  talk. The attention 
line 14169=>of Pippin's audience was disturbed. Some of the  hobbits looked at Frodo and 
line 14170=>laughed and clapped, thinking that  Mr. Underhill  had taken as  much ale as 
line 14171=>was good for him. 
line 14172=>     Frodo  suddenly felt very foolish,  and found himself (as was his habit 
line 14173=>when making a speech) fingering  the things in his pocket. He felt the  Ring  
line 14174=>on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on 
line 14175=>and vanish out of the silly  situation. It seemed to him,  somehow, as if me 
line 14176=>suggestion came to him from outside,  from someone or  something a the room. 
line 14177=>He resisted the  temptation firmly, and clasped  the Ring in his hand, as if 
line 14178=>to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief.  At 
line 14179=>any rate it  gave him no inspiration. He spoke  'a  few suitable  words', as 
line 14180=>they  would have said  in the  Shire: We  are all  very much gratified by the 
line 14181=>kindness of your reception, and  I  venture to hope that my brief visit will 
line 14182=>help to  renew  the old ties of  friendship between the Shire and Bree;  and 
line 14183=>then he hesitated and coughed. 
line 14184=>     Everyone in the room was now  looking at him. 'A song!' shouted one  of 
line 14185=>the hobbits.  'A song! A song!' shouted all the others.  'Come on now, master, 
line 14186=>
line 14187=>####-sing us something that we haven't heard before!' 
line 14188=>     For  a  moment  Frodo  stood gaping. Then  in  desperation he  began  a  
line 14189=>ridiculous song tha t Bilbo had been rather  fond of (and indeed rather proud 
line 14190=>of, for he had made up the words himself). It was about an inn; and that  is 
line 14191=>probably why it came into Frodo's mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a  
line 14192=>few words of it are now, as a rule, remember ed. 
line 14193=>     There is an inn, a merry old inn 
line 14194=>     beneath an old grey hill, 
line 14195=>     And there they brew a beer so brown  
line 14196=>     That the Man in the Moon himself came down  
line 14197=>     one night to drink his fill. 
line 14198=> 
line 14199=>     The ostler has a tipsy cat 
line 14200=>     that plays a five-stringed fiddle; 
line 14201=>     And up and down he runs his bow,  
line 14202=>     Now squeaking high, now purring low,  
line 14203=>     now sawing in the middle. 
line 14204=> 
line 14205=>     The landlord keeps a little dog 
line 14206=>     that is mighty fond of jokes; 
line 14207=>     When there's good cheer among the guests, 
line 14208=>     He cocks an ear at all the jests 
line 14209=>     and laughs until he chokes. 
line 14210=> 
line 14211=>     They also keep a horned cow 
line 14212=>     as proud as any queen; 
line 14213=>     But music turns her head like ale, 
line 14214=>     And makes her wave her tufted tail 
line 14215=>     and dance upon the green. 
line 14216=> 
line 14217=>     And O! the rows of silver dishes 
line 14218=>     and the store of silver spoons! 
line 14219=>     For Sunday* there's a special pair, 
line 14220=>     And these they polish up with care 
line 14221=>     on Saturday afternoons. 
line 14222=> 
line 14223=>     The Man in the Moon was drinking deep, 
line 14224=>
line 14225=>####-     and the cat began to wail; 
line 14226=>     A dish and a  spoon on the table danced, 
line 14227=>     The cow in the garden madly pranced, 
line 14228=>     and the little dog chased his tail. 
line 14229=> 
line 14230=>     The Man in the Moon took another mug, 
line 14231=>     and then rolled beneath his chair; 
line 14232=>     And there he dozed and dreamed of ale, 
line 14233=>     Till in the sky the stars were pale, 
line 14234=>     and dawn was in the air. 
line 14235=> 
line 14236=>     Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat: 
line 14237=>     'The white horses of the Moon, 
line 14238=>     They neigh and champ their silver bits; 
line 14239=>     But their master's been and drowned his wits, 
line 14240=>     and the Sun'll be rising soon!'  
line 14241=> 
line 14242=>     So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle, 
line 14243=>     a jig that would wake the dead: 
line 14244=>     He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune, 
line 14245=>     While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon: 
line 14246=>     'It's after three!' he said. 
line 14247=> 
line 14248=>     They rolled the Man slowly up the hill 
line 14249=>     and bundled him into the Moon, 
line 14250=>     While his horses galloped up in rear, 
line 14251=>     And the cow came capering like a deer, 
line 14252=>     and a dish ran up with the spoon. 
line 14253=> 
line 14254=>     Now quicker the fiddle went deedle -dum-diddle; 
line 14255=>     the dog began to roar, 
line 14256=>     The cow and the horses stood on their heads; 
line 14257=>     The guests all bounded from their beds 
line 14258=>     and danced upon the floor. 
line 14259=> 
line 14260=>     With a ping and a pong the fiddle -strings broke! 
line 14261=>     the cow jumped over the Moon, 
line 14262=>
line 14263=>####-     And the little dog laughed to see such fun, 
line 14264=>     And the Saturday dish went off at a run 
line 14265=>     with the silver Sunday spoon. 
line 14266=> 
line 14267=>     The round Moon rolled behind the hill 
line 14268=>     as the Sun raised up her head. 
line 14269=>     She* hardly believed her fiery eyes; 
line 14270=>     For though it was day, to her surprise 
line 14271=>     they all went back to bed! 
line 14272=>     There was loud and long applause. Frodo had a  good voice, and the song  
line 14273=>tickled their fancy.  'Where's old Barley?' they  cried. 'He ought  to  hear 
line 14274=>this. Bob  ought to learn his cat  the fiddle, and then we'd have a  dance.' 
line 14275=>They called for more ale, and  began to shout: 'Let's have it again, master! 
line 14276=>Come on now! Once more!' 
line 14277=>     They made  Frodo have another drink,  and then  begin his  song  again, 
line 14278=>while many of them  joined  in; for the tune was  well known, and  they were 
line 14279=>quick at picking up  words.  It  was now Frodo's turn to feel  pleased  with 
line 14280=>himself. He capered  about on the table; and when he came  a second  time to 
line 14281=>the cow jumped over the Moon, he leaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for  
line 14282=>he came down,  bang, into a  tray full of mugs, and slipped, and  rolled off 
line 14283=>the table with  a crash, clatter, and bump!  The audience  all opened  their 
line 14284=>mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short a gaping silence; for the singer  
line 14285=>disappeared. He simply  vanished, as  if he had  gone slap through the floor  
line 14286=>without leaving a hole!  
line 14287=>     The  local hobbits  stared in  amazement, and then sprang to their feet 
line 14288=>and shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away from Pippin and Sam, 
line 14289=>who 
line 14290=>found themselves left alone in a comer, and eyed darkly and  doubtfully from 
line 14291=>a  distance.  It was  plain  that many  people  regarded  them  now  as  the 
line 14292=>companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But 
line 14293=>there 
line 14294=>was one  swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with  a knowing  and 
line 14295=>half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable. Presently he 
line 14296=>slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had 
line 14297=>been  whispering  together  a  good  deal  during  the  evening.  Harry  the 
line 14298=>gatekeeper also went out just behind them.. 
line 14299=>     Frodo felt  a fool. Not knowing what else  to do, he crawled away under  
line 14300=>
line 14301=>####-the tables to the  dark comer by Strider, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of 
line 14302=>his thoughts. Frodo leaned back  against the wall and took off the Ring. How 
line 14303=>it came to be on his finger he could not tell. He could only suppose that he 
line 14304=>had  been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and  that somehow  it had 
line 14305=>slipped on  when he stuck out  his hand with a jerk to save his  fall. For a  
line 14306=>moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick; perhaps it 
line 14307=>had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt 
line 14308=>in the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had gone out. 
line 14309=>     'Well?' said Strider, when he rea ppeared.  'Why did you do that?  Worse 
line 14310=>than anything your friends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or  
line 14311=>should I say your finger?' 
line 14312=>     'I don't know what you mean,' said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed. 
line 14313=>     'Oh yes, you do,' answered Strider; 'but  we had better wait  until the 
line 14314=>uproar has  died down. Then, if you  please, Mr.  Baggins, I should  like  a  
line 14315=>quiet word with you.' 
line 14316=>     'What about?' asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name. 
line 14317=>     'A matter of  some importance  -  to us both,' answered Strider, looking 
line 14318=>Frodo in the eye. 'You may hear something to your advantage.' 
line 14319=>     'Very  well,' said Frodo,  trying to appear unconcerned. 'I'll talk  to 
line 14320=>you later.' 
line 14321=>     Meanwhile an argument was going on by the  fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had 
line 14322=>come trotting  in, and  he was now  trying  to listen to several conflicting 
line 14323=>accounts of the event at the same time. 
line 14324=>     'I saw him, Mr.  Butterbur,' said a hobbit;  'or leastways I didn't see 
line 14325=>him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished  into thin air, in a manner of 
line 14326=>speaking.' 
line 14327=>     'You don't say, Mr. Mugwort!' said the landlord, looking puzzled. 
line 14328=>     'Yes I do!' replied Mugwort. 'And I mean what I say, what's more.' 
line 14329=>     'There's some  mistake  somewhere,' said  Butterbur,  shaking his head. 
line 14330=>There was  too much of  that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing  into thin air; or  
line 14331=>into thick air, as is more likely in this room.' 
line 14332=>     'Well, where is he now?' cried several voices.  
line 14333=>     'How should I  know?  He's welcome to go  where he will, so long as  he  
line 14334=>pays in the  morning. There's Mr. Took, now: he's not vanished.' 
line 14335=>     'Well,  I  saw what I  saw,  and  I saw what I  didn't,'  said  Mugwort 
line 14336=>obstinately. 
line 14337=>     'And I say there's  some mistake,' repeated  Butterbur,  picking up the 
line 14338=>
line 14339=>####-tray and gathering up the broken crockery. 
line 14340=>     'Of course there's a mistake!' said Frodo. 'I haven't vanished. Here  I 
line 14341=>am! I've just been having a few words with Strider in the comer.' 
line 14342=>     He  came forward into  the  firelight;  but most of the company  backed 
line 14343=>away,, even more perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied 
line 14344=>by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly  under the  tables after  
line 14345=>he  had fallen. Most of the  Hobbits  and the Men of Bree went off then  and 
line 14346=>there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that evening. One 
line 14347=>or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves.  
line 14348=>The 
line 14349=>Dwarves and the two or three strange Men that still remained got up and said 
line 14350=>good night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before long no 
line 14351=>one was left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall. 
line 14352=>     Mr. Butterbur did  not seem  much put out. He reckoned,  very probably,  
line 14353=>that his house would be full again on many future  nights, until the present 
line 14354=>mystery had been  thoroughly discussed. 'N ow what have  you been doing,  Mr. 
line 14355=>Underhill?'  he asked.  'Frightening  my customers and breaking up my crocks 
line 14356=>with your acrobatics!' 
line 14357=>     'I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,' said Frodo. 'It was quite 
line 14358=>unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.' 
line 14359=>     'All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you're going to do any more tumbling, 
line 14360=>or conjuring, or whatever it was, you'd best warn folk beforehand  - and warn 
line 14361=>me. We're a bit suspicious round here of anything  out of  the way -uncanny,  
line 14362=>if you understand me; and we don't take to it all of a sudden.' 
line 14363=>     'I shan't be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise 
line 14364=>you.  And now  I think I'll be getting  to bed. We shall be  making an early 
line 14365=>start. Will you see that our ponies are ready by  eight o'clock?' 
line 14366=>     'Very  good! But  before  you go, I  should like  a  word  with you  in 
line 14367=>private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my mind that I ought 
line 14368=>to tell you. I hope that you'll not take it amiss. When I've seen to a thing 
line 14369=>or two, I'll come along to your room, if you're willing.' 
line 14370=>     'Certainly!'  said Frodo; but his  heart  sank.  He wondered  how  many 
line 14371=>private talks  he would have before  he  got to  bed,  and  what  they would 
line 14372=>reveal. Were  these people  all in league against him?  He  began to suspect 
line 14373=>even old Butterbur's fat face of concealing dark designs. 
line 14374=> 
line 14375=> 
line 14376=>
line 14377=>####-<h4>Chapter 10</h4> <br>. Strider 
line 14378=>
line 14379=> 
line 14380=> 
line 14381=>     Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no 
line 14382=>light. Merry was not there, and the  fire had burned low.  It  was not until 
line 14383=>they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots 
line 14384=>that they discovered Strider had come with them. There he was calmly sitting 
line 14385=>in a chair by the door! 
line 14386=>     'Hallo!' said Pippin. 'Who are you, and what do you want?' 
line 14387=>     'I  am called Strider,' he answered: 'and  though he may have forgotten 
line 14388=>it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.' 
line 14389=>     'You  said  I  might  hear something to my advantage, I  believe,' said 
line 14390=>Frodo. 'What have you to say?' 
line 14391=>     'Several things,' a nswered Strider. 'But, of course, I have my price.' 
line 14392=>     'What do you mean?' asked Frodo sharply. 
line 14393=>     'Don't be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you  what I  know, and 
line 14394=>give you some good advice  - but I shall want a reward.' 
line 14395=>     'And what will that be, pray?' said Frodo. He suspected now that he had 
line 14396=>fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably  that  he had  brought 
line 14397=>only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he 
line 14398=>could not spare any of it. 
line 14399=>     'No more than  you  can afford,' answered  Strider with a slow smile, as 
line 14400=>if he guessed Frodo's thoughts. 'Just this: you must take me along with you, 
line 14401=>until I wish to leave you.' 
line 14402=>     'Oh, indeed!' replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. 'Even if 
line 14403=>I wanted another  companion, I should  not  agree to any such thing, until I 
line 14404=>knew a good deal more about you, and your business.' 
line 14405=>     'Excellent!' exclaimed  Strider,  crossing  his legs  and sitting  back  
line 14406=>comfortably. 'You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to 
line 14407=>the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you  
line 14408=>what I know, and leave the reward to  you. You may be glad to grant it, when 
line 14409=>you have heard me.' 
line 14410=>     'Go on then!' said Frodo. 'What do you know?' 
line 14411=>     'Too much; too many dark things,' said Strider grimly. 'But as for your 
line 14412=>business --' He got  up and went to the door,  opened it quickly  and looked 
line 14413=>out.  Then  he shut it quietly and  sat  down again. 'I have quick ears,' he 
line 14414=>went  on, lowering his voice, 'and  though I cannot disappear, I have hunted 
line 14415=>
line 14416=>####-many  wild  and wary  things and I can usually avoid being  seen, if I wish. 
line 14417=>Now, I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four 
line 14418=>hobbits  came out  of the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to 
line 14419=>old  Bombadil  or  to  one  another, but  one  thing interested  me.  Please 
line 14420=>remember, said one of them,  that the name Baggins  must not be mentioned. I 
line 14421=>am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given. That interested me so much that 
line 14422=>I followed them here.  I slipped  over the gate just behind them.  Maybe Mr.  
line 14423=>Baggins  has  an  honest reason  for  leaving his name  behind; but if so, I 
line 14424=>should advise him and his friends to be more careful.' 
line 14425=>     'I don't see what interest my name has for any one in Bree,' sa id Frodo 
line 14426=>angrily,  'and I have still to  learn why  it interests you. Mr. Strider may 
line 14427=>have an honest reason  for spying  and eavesdropping;  but  if so,  I should 
line 14428=>advise him to explain it.' 
line 14429=>     'Well answered!' said Strider laughing. 'But the explanation is simple: 
line 14430=>     I was looking for  a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I wanted  to find him 
line 14431=>quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret 
line 14432=>that concerned me and my friends.  
line 14433=>     'Now, don't mistake me!' he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam 
line 14434=>jumped up  with a scowl. 'I shall take more care of  the secret than you do. 
line 14435=>And care  is  needed!' He leaned forward  and  looked at them. 'Watch  every 
line 14436=>shadow!' he said in a  low  voice. 'Black horsemen have passed through Bree. 
line 14437=>On  Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared 
line 14438=>later, 
line 14439=>coming up the Greenway from the south.' 
line 14440=>     There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: 'I ought to 
line 14441=>have guessed  it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,' he said.  'And  the 
line 14442=>landlord  seems  to  have heard something. Why did  he press us to join  the 
line 14443=>company?  And  why  on  earth  did we  behave so foolishly: we ought to have 
line 14444=>stayed quiet in here.' 
line 14445=>     'It would  have been better,' said Strider. 'I would  have stopped your 
line 14446=>going into  the  common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me 
line 14447=>in to see you, or take a message.' 
line 14448=>     'Do you think he------' began Frodo. 
line 14449=>     'No,  I  don't  think any  harm  of old Butterbur.  Only  he  does  not 
line 14450=>altogether like  mysterious vagabonds  of my sort.' Frodo gave him a puzzled 
line 14451=>look. 'Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?' said Strider with a  
line 14452=>curl of his lip and a  queer gleam in  his eye. 'But I  hope we shall get to 
line 14453=>
line 14454=>####-know one another better.  When we do, I hope you will explain  what happened 
line 14455=>at the end of your song. For that little prank ------' 
line 14456=>     'It was sheer accident!' interrupted Frodo. 
line 14457=>     'I wonder,' said Strider. 'Accident, then. That  accident has made your 
line 14458=>position dangerous.' 
line 14459=>     'Hardly more than it  was already,' said Frodo.  'I knew these horsemen 
line 14460=>were pursuing me;  but now  at any rate they seem to  have  missed me and to 
line 14461=>have gone away.' 
line 14462=>     'You  must not count on that!' said Strider sharply. 'They will return. 
line 14463=>And more  are  coming. There are others. I know their  number. I know  these 
line 14464=>Riders.' He paused,  and his  eyes were cold and hard. 'And there  are  some 
line 14465=>folk  in Bree who  are  not to be  trusted,'  he went on.  'Bill  Ferny, for  
line 14466=>instance. He  has an evil name in the Bree-land,  and queer folk call at his 
line 14467=>house.  You  must  have  noticed him among the  company:  a swarthy sneering 
line 14468=>fellow.  He  was very close with  one  of  the Southern  strangers, and they 
line 14469=>slipped  out   together  just  after  your  "accident".  Not  all  of  those 
line 14470=>Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything  to anybody; 
line 14471=>or make mischief for amusement.' 
line 14472=>     'What  will Ferny sell,  and what has my accident got to do  with him?' 
line 14473=>said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider's hints.  
line 14474=>     'News  of you,  of  course,'  answered  Strider.  'An  account of  your 
line 14475=>performance would  be very interesting to certain  people.  After that  they 
line 14476=>would hardly  need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely  
line 14477=>that they will hear of it befor e this night is over. Is that enough? You can 
line 14478=>do as you like  about my  reward: take me as a guide  or  not. But I may say 
line 14479=>that I know all the lands  between the Shire and  the Misty Mountains, for I 
line 14480=>have  wandered over  them for many years. I  am  older than  I look. I might  
line 14481=>prove useful. You will  have to leave the  open  road after tonight; for the 
line 14482=>horsemen will  watch  it  night and  day. You may  escape from  Bree, and be 
line 14483=>allowed to  go forward while the Sun is up;  but you won't go far. They will 
line 14484=>come on you in the wild, in some dark  place where  there is no help. Do you 
line 14485=>wish them to find you? They are terrible!' 
line 14486=>     The  hobbits looked at him,  and  saw  with surprise that  his face was 
line 14487=>drawn  as if with pain, and  his hands clenched the arms of  his  chair. The 
line 14488=>room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a 
line 14489=>while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening  
line 14490=>to sounds in the Night far away. 
line 14491=>
line 14492=>####-     'There!' he  cried  after  a moment, drawing his hand  across his brow.  
line 14493=>'Perhaps I know  more about these pursuers than you  do.  You fear them, but 
line 14494=>you do not fear them enough,  yet. Tomorrow you will  have to escape, if you 
line 14495=>can. Strider can take  you by paths that  are  seldom trodden. Will you have 
line 14496=>him? ' 
line 14497=>     There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer, his mind was  confused 
line 14498=>with doubt and fear. Sam frowned,  and looked at his  master; and at last he 
line 14499=>broke out: 
line 14500=>     'With  your leave,  Mr. Frodo, I'd  say no! This Strider here, he warns 
line 14501=>and he says take care; and  I say  yes to that, and let's begin with him. He 
line 14502=>comes out  of  the Wild, and I  never heard no good  of such  folk. He knows 
line 14503=>something, that's  plain,  and more  than  I like; but it's no reason why we 
line 14504=>should let him go leading us out into  some dark place  far from help, as he 
line 14505=>puts it.' 
line 14506=>     Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, 
line 14507=>but turned his keen eyes  on Frodo. Frodo caught his glance and looked away. 
line 14508=>'No,' he said slowly. 'I don't agree. I think, I think you are not really as 
line 14509=>you  choose to  look. You began  to talk to me like the Bree-folk,  but your 
line 14510=>voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don't see why you should 
line 14511=>warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise?  
line 14512=>Who are  you? What do you really know about - about my business; and how  
line 14513=>do 
line 14514=>you know it?' 
line 14515=>     'The lesson in caution has been well learned,' said Strider with a grim 
line 14516=>smile. 'But caution is one thing and wavering is another. You will never get 
line 14517=>to Rivende ll now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You  must  
line 14518=>make up your  mind. I will answer some of your  questions, if that will help 
line 14519=>you to do so.  But  why should you believe  my story, if you do not trust me 
line 14520=>already? Still here it is------' 
line 14521=>     At that  moment  there  came a  knock at the  door.  Mr. Butterbur  had 
line 14522=>arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of hot water. Strider 
line 14523=>withdrew into a dark corner. 
line 14524=>     'I've come  to bid  you  good night,' said  the  landlord,  putting the 
line 14525=>candles on the table. 'Nob!  Take  the  water to the rooms!' He came in  and 
line 14526=>shut the door. 
line 14527=>     'It's like  this,' he began,  hesitating and looking troubled. 'If I've 
line 14528=>done any harm, I'm sorry indeed. But one thing drives out another, as you'll 
line 14529=>
line 14530=>####-admit; and  I'm a busy man.  But first one thing and then another  this week  
line 14531=>have jogged my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, 
line 14532=>I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name of 
line 14533=>Baggins in particular.' 
line 14534=>     'And what has that got to do with me?' asked Frodo. 
line 14535=>     'Ah! you know best,'  said the landlord, knowingly.  'I won't give  you  
line 14536=>away;  but  I  was  told that  this  Baggins would be going by  the  name of 
line 14537=>Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you  well enough, if I may 
line 14538=>say so.' 
line 14539=>     'Indeed! Let's have it then!' said Frodo, unwisely interrupting. 
line 14540=>     'A stout  little fellow with red cheeks,' said  Mr. Butterbur solemnly. 
line 14541=>Pippin chuckled,  but Sam looked indignant. 'That won't  help  you  much; it 
line 14542=>goes for  most hobbits. Barley, he says to me,' continued Mr. Butterbur with 
line 14543=>a glance at Pippin.  'But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, 
line 14544=>and he  has a cleft in his  chin: perky chap with a bright eye. Begging your 
line 14545=>pardon, but he said it, not me.' 
line 14546=>     'He said it? And who was he?' asked Frodo eagerly. 
line 14547=>     'Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, 
line 14548=>but he's a  good  friend of mine, whether or no. But now  I  don't know what 
line 14549=>he'll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into 
line 14550=>a block of  wood, I  shouldn't wonder. He's  a  bit hasty. Still what's done 
line 14551=>can't be undone. ' 
line 14552=>     'Well, what have you done?' said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow 
line 14553=>unravelling of Butterbur's thoughts. 
line 14554=>     'Where was I?' said the landlord,  pausing  and  snapping  his fingers.  
line 14555=>'Ah,  yes!  Old Gandalf. Three  months  back he walked  right  into  my room 
line 14556=>without  a  knock. Barley, he says, I'm off in  the  morning.  Will  you  do 
line 14557=>something for me? You've  only to name it,  I said. I'm in a hurry,  said he, 
line 14558=>and  I've no time myself, but I want  a message took to the Shire. Have  you 
line 14559=>anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find someone, I  said, tomorrow,  
line 14560=>maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow,   he says, and then he gave  me  a  
line 14561=>letter. 
line 14562=>     'It's addressed plain enough,' said Mr.  Butterbur,  producing a letter  
line 14563=>from his pocket,  and reading out the  address slowly and proudly (he valued  
line 14564=>his reputation as a lettered man): 
line 14565=>     Mr FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE. 
line 14566=>     'A letter for me from Gandalf!' cried Frodo. 
line 14567=>
line 14568=>####-     'Ah!' said Mr. Butterbur. 'Then your right name is Baggins?' 
line 14569=>     'It is,' said Frodo, 'and you had better give me that  letter  at once, 
line 14570=>and explain  why  you  never sent it.  That's  what you came  to tell  me, I 
line 14571=>suppose, though you've taken a long time to come to the point.' 
line 14572=>     Poor Mr. Butterbur looked  troubled.  'You're right, master,' he  said, 
line 14573=>'and I beg  your pardon. And I'm mortal  afraid of what Gandalf will say, if 
line 14574=>harm comes  of it. But I didn't  keep  it back a -purpose. I put  it by safe. 
line 14575=>Then I couldn't find nobody willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day 
line 14576=>after, and  none of  my own folk were to spare;  and  then  one  thing after  
line 14577=>another drove it out of my mind. I'm a  busy man. I'll do what I can to  set  
line 14578=>matters right, and if there's any help I can give, you've only to name it. 
line 14579=>     'Leaving the letter aside, I  promised Gandalf no less. Barley, he says 
line 14580=>to  me, this friend of mine from the Shire, he may  be coming out  this  way 
line 14581=>before long, him and another. He'll be calling himself Underhill. Mind that! 
line 14582=>But  you need  ask  no  questions.  And if I'm  not with him, he  may  be in  
line 14583=>trouble, and  he  may need  help. Do whatever you can for him,  and I'll  be 
line 14584=>grateful, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.' 
line 14585=>     'What do you mean?' asked Frodo. 
line 14586=>     'These  black  men,' said  the landlord lowering  his  voice.  'They're 
line 14587=>looking  for  Baggins, and if they mean well, then  I'm a hobbit. It was  on 
line 14588=>Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny,  
line 14589=>I 
line 14590=>called  it. Nob, he came and told me that two  black  men were  at  the door  
line 14591=>asking  for a  hobbit called Baggins. Nob's hair was all stood on end. I bid 
line 14592=>the  black  fellows be off, and  slammed the door on them; but they've  been 
line 14593=>asking the same  question all the  way to  Archet, I hear. And that  Ranger, 
line 14594=>Strider, he's been asking  questions, too. Tried to get in here  to see you, 
line 14595=>before you'd had bite or sup, he did.' 
line 14596=>     'He did!' said Strider suddenly, coming  forward into  the light.  'And 
line 14597=>much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, Barliman.' 
line 14598=>     The landlord  jumped with surprise.  'You!'  he  cried.  'You're always 
line 14599=>popping up. What do you want now?' 
line 14600=>      'He's here with my leave,' said Frodo.  'He came to offer me his help.' 
line 14601=>     'Well, you  know your own business, maybe,' said Mr. Butterbur, looking 
line 14602=>suspiciously  at Strider. 'But if I  was in your plight,  I wouldn't take up 
line 14603=>with a Ranger.' 
line 14604=>     'Then who would  you take up with?' asked Strider. 'A fat innkeeper who 
line 14605=>
line 14606=>####-only remembers his own name  because people  shout  it at him  all day? They 
line 14607=>cannot stay in The  Pony for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long 
line 14608=>road before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?' 
line 14609=>     'Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn't do that for any money,' said Mr. Butterbur, 
line 14610=>looking  really scared. 'But why can't you stay here  quiet for  a  bit, Mr. 
line 14611=>Underhill?  What are  all  these  queer goings on? What are these black   men 
line 14612=>after, and where do they come from, I'd like to know?' 
line 14613=>     'I'm sorry I  can't explain it all,' answered  Frodo.  'I  am tired and 
line 14614=>very worried, and it's a long tale. But  if you mean to help me, I  ought to 
line 14615=>warn you  that you will be in  danger  as long as I  am in your house. These 
line 14616=>Black Riders: I am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from------' 
line 14617=>     'They  come from Mordor,'  said  Strider in a low  voice. 'From Mordor, 
line 14618=>Barliman, if that means anything to you.' 
line 14619=>     'Save us!' cried  Mr.  Bu tterbur turning  pale; the  name evidently was 
line 14620=>known to him. 'That is the worst news that has come to Bree in my time.' 'It 
line 14621=>is,' said  Frodo. 'Are  you still  willing to help  me?'  'I  am,'  said Mr. 
line 14622=>Butterbur. 'More than ever. Though I don't know what the likes of me  can do 
line 14623=>against, against ------' he faltered. 
line 14624=>     'Against the Shadow in the  East,' said  Strider  quietly.  'Not  much, 
line 14625=>Barliman, but  every  little  helps. You  can let  Mr. Underhill  stay  here 
line 14626=>tonight, as Mr. Underhill, and you can forget the  name of Baggins,  till he 
line 14627=>is far away.' 
line 14628=>     'I'll do that,' said Butterbur. 'But they'll find out he's here without 
line 14629=>help from me, I'm afraid. It's a pity  Mr. Baggins drew attention to himself 
line 14630=>this evening, to  say no more. The story of that  Mr. Bilbo's  going off has 
line 14631=>been heard before tonight in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing 
line 14632=>in his slow pate: and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than he 
line 14633=>is.' 
line 14634=>     'Well, we can only hope the Riders won't come back yet,' said Frodo. 
line 14635=>     'I hope  not, indeed,' said Butterbur. 'But spooks  or no spooks,  they 
line 14636=>won't get in The Pony so easy.  Don't you worry till the morning. Nob'll say 
line 14637=>no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while  I can stand on my legs. Me 
line 14638=>and my folk'll keep watch  tonight; but you had best get some  sleep, if you  
line 14639=>can.' 
line 14640=>     'In any case we  must be called at  dawn,' said Frodo. 'We must get off 
line 14641=>as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.' 
line 14642=>     'Right!  I'll see to the orders,'  said the landlord. 'Good night,  Mr. 
line 14643=>
line 14644=>####-Baggins - Underhill, I should say! Good night  -  now, bless me! Where's your 
line 14645=>Mr. Brandybuck?' 
line 14646=>     'I don't know,' said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had  forgotten all 
line 14647=>about  Merry, and it was  getting late.  'I  am afraid  he is  out. He  said 
line 14648=>something about going for a breath of air.' 
line 14649=>     'Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on 
line 14650=>a holiday!' said Butterbur. 'I must go and bar the doors quick, but I'll see 
line 14651=>your friend is let  in when  he comes.  I'd better send Nob to look for him. 
line 14652=>Good  night  to  you all!'  At  last  Mr. Butterbur  went out,  with another  
line 14653=>doubtful look at Strider and  a  shake of his  head. His footsteps retreated 
line 14654=>down the passage. 
line 14655=>     'Well?' said Strider. 'When are  you  going to open that letter?' Frodo 
line 14656=>looked carefully at  the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly  to be 
line 14657=>Gandalf's. Inside, written in the  wizard's strong but  graceful script, was 
line 14658=>the following message: 
line 14659=>     THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear's Day, Shire Year, 1418. 
line 14660=>     Dear Frodo, 
line 14661=>     Bad news has reached me here.  I must go  off at  once. You  had better 
line 14662=>leave  Bag End  soon, and get out of the  Shire before  the  end  of July at 
line 14663=>latest. I will return as soon  as I can; and I will follow  you,  if  I find 
line 14664=>that you are gone. Leave a  message for me here,  if you  pass through Bree. 
line 14665=>You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the 
line 14666=>Road: a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. He knows our business 
line 14667=>and will help you. Make for  Rivendell. There I hope we may meet again. If I  
line 14668=>do not come, Elrond will advise you. 
line 14669=>     Yours in haste  
line 14670=>     GANDALF. 
line 14671=>     PS. Do NOT use It  again, not far any reason whatever! Do not travel by 
line 14672=>night! 
line 14673=>     PPS. Make  sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men 
line 14674=>on the roads. His true name is Aragorn. 
line 14675=>     All that is gold does not glitter, 
line 14676=>     Not all those who wander are lost; 
line 14677=>     The old that is strong does not wither, 
line 14678=>     Deep roots are not reached by the frost. 
line 14679=>     From the ashes a fire shall be woken, 
line 14680=>     A light from the shadows shall spring; 
line 14681=>
line 14682=>####-     Renewed shall be blade that was broken, 
line 14683=>     The crownless again shall be king. 
line 14684=> 
line 14685=> 
line 14686=>     PPPS.  I hope  Butterbur  sends  this promptly.  A  worthy man, but his 
line 14687=>memory is  like a lumber-roam: thing wanted always buried. If he  forgets, I  
line 14688=>shall roast him. 
line 14689=>     Fare Well! 
line 14690=>     Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. 
line 14691=>'Really  old Butterbur has  made  a mess of things!' he  said. 'He  deserves 
line 14692=>roasting. If  I  had  got this  at  once,  we  might all have  been safe  in 
line 14693=>Rivendell  by now. But what can have happened to Gandalf? He writes as if he 
line 14694=>was going into great danger.' 
line 14695=>     'He has been doing that for many years,' said Strider. 
line 14696=>     Frodo  turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf's 
line 14697=>second postscript. 'Why didn't you tell me that you were Gandalf's friend at 
line 14698=>once?' he asked.  'It would have saved time.' 
line 14699=>     'Would it? Would any of  you have believed me till now?' said  Strider. 
line 14700=>'I knew nothing  of this letter.  For  all I knew I  had  to persuade you to 
line 14701=>trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend 
line 14702=>to tell you  all about myself at once. I had  to study you  first,  and make 
line 14703=>sure of  you. The  Enemy has set traps  for  me before  now. As soon as I had 
line 14704=>made up my  mind, I was  ready to tell you  whatever  you asked.  But I must 
line 14705=>admit,' he added with a queer laugh,  'that I hoped you would take to me for  
line 14706=>my  own  sake. A  hunted  man sometimes  wearies  of distrust  a nd longs for 
line 14707=>friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.' 
line 14708=>     'They  are - at first sight at any rate,'  laughed  Pippin with  sudden 
line 14709=>relief after reading Gandalf's letter. 'But handsome is as handsome does, as 
line 14710=>we  say in the Shire; and  I daresay  we  shall all look much the same after  
line 14711=>lying for days in hedges and ditches.' 
line 14712=>     'It  would  take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering 
line 14713=>in the Wild to make you look like Strider,' he answered. 'And you would  die 
line 14714=>first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.' 
line 14715=>     Pippin  subsided; but  Sam was not  daunted, and he  still eyed Strider  
line 14716=>dubiously. 'How do we know you are the  Strider that  Gandalf speaks about?' 
line 14717=>he  demanded. 'You  never  mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You  
line 14718=>might be  a  play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with 
line 14719=>
line 14720=>####-you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have 
line 14721=>you to say to that?' 
line 14722=>     'That you are a stout fellow,' answered  Strider;   'but I am  afraid my 
line 14723=>only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed the real Strider, I 
line 14724=>could kill you. And I  should have killed you already without  so much talk. 
line 14725=>If I was after the Ring, I could have it - NOW!' 
line 14726=>     He stood up,  and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a  
line 14727=>light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the 
line 14728=>hilt of a sword that had  hung concealed by  his  side. They did not dare to 
line 14729=>move. Sam sat wide-mouthed staring at him dumbly. 
line 14730=>     'But I am the real Strider, fortunately,' he said, looking down at them 
line 14731=>with his face softened by a sudden smile. 'I am Aragorn son of Arathorn; and 
line 14732=>if by life or death I can save you, I will.' 
line 14733=>     There  was  a long silence.  At last Frodo  spoke  with  hesitation.  'I 
line 14734=>believed  that you were  a friend before the letter came,' he  said,  'or at 
line 14735=>least I wished to.  You  have frightened me several times tonight, but never  
line 14736=>in the way that servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of 
line 14737=>his spies would - well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.' 
line 14738=>     'I see,' laughed Strider. 'I  look foul and feel fair. Is that  it? All 
line 14739=>that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.' 
line 14740=>     'Did the  verses apply to you then?' asked Frodo. 'I could not make out 
line 14741=>what they were  about.  But how did  you  know that they  were  in Gandalf's 
line 14742=>letter, if you have never seen it?' 
line 14743=>     'I did not  know,' he answered. 'But I am Aragorn, and  those verses go 
line 14744=>with  that  name.' He  drew out his swor d,  and they saw that  the blade was 
line 14745=>indeed  broken  a  foot  below  the hilt. 'Not much  use is  it, Sam?'  said 
line 14746=>Strider. 'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.' 
line 14747=>     Sam said nothing. 
line 14748=>     'Well,' said Strider, 'with Sam's permission we will call that settled. 
line 14749=>Strider shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road tomorrow. Even if we 
line 14750=>are allowed  to  leave  Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave  it  
line 14751=>unnoticed. But  I shall try to get  lost as soon as possible.  I know one or  
line 14752=>two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the 
line 14753=>pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.' 
line 14754=>     'Weathertop?' said Sam. 'What's that?' 
line 14755=>     'It is a hill,  just to the north of the Road, about half way from here 
line 14756=>to Rivendell.  It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have  a  
line 14757=>
line 14758=>####-chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. 
line 14759=>After Weathertop our  journey will become more difficult, and  we shall have 
line 14760=>to choose between various dangers.' 
line 14761=>     'When did you last see Gandalf?' asked Frodo. 'Do you know where he is, 
line 14762=>or what he is doing?' 
line 14763=>     Strider looked  grave. 'I do not know,' he said. 'I came  west with him 
line 14764=>in the spring.  I have often kept watch  on  the borders of the Shire in the 
line 14765=>last few years,  when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We 
line 14766=>last met on the first  of May: at  Sam  Ford down the Brandywine. He told me 
line 14767=>that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for  
line 14768=>Rivendell in the last week  of September. As I knew  he  was at your side, I 
line 14769=>went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved ill;  for plainly some 
line 14770=>news reached him, and I was not at hand to help. 
line 14771=>     'I am troubled, for the  first time  since I have known  him. We should 
line 14772=>have had messages, even if he  could not come himself. When I returned, many 
line 14773=>days  ago, I heard the ill  news.  The tidings had gone  far  and wide  that 
line 14774=>Gandalf was missing and the horsemen had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of 
line 14775=>Gildor that told me this;  and  later  they told me that you had  left  your 
line 14776=>home; but there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I  have  been watching 
line 14777=>the East Road anxiously.' 
line 14778=>     'Do  you  think  the Black Riders  have  anything to do  with it  - with 
line 14779=>Gandalf's absence, I mean?' asked Frodo. 
line 14780=>     'I  do  not know of anything else  that could have hindered him, except 
line 14781=>the  Enemy himself,'  said  Strider. 'But do not give  up  hope! Gandalf  is 
line 14782=>greater than you Shire-folk know  -  as a rule you can only see his jokes and 
line 14783=>toys. But this business of ours will be his greatest task.' 
line 14784=>     Pippin yawned. 'I am sorry,' he said, 'but I am dead tired. In spite of 
line 14785=>all  the danger and worry  I must go to  bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is 
line 14786=>that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in 
line 14787=>the dark to look for him.' 
line 14788=>     At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the 
line 14789=>passage. Merry came  in  with a  rush followed  by  Nob.  He shut  the  door  
line 14790=>hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They  stared at him in 
line 14791=>alarm for  a moment before he gasped: 'I have seen  them, Frodo! I have seen 
line 14792=>them! Black Riders!' 
line 14793=>     'Black Riders!' cried Frodo. 'Where?' 
line 14794=>     'Here. In the village. I  stayed indoors for  an  hour. Then as you did 
line 14795=>
line 14796=>####-not  come  back, I  went out  for a  stroll.  I  had come back again and was 
line 14797=>standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I 
line 14798=>shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping near: there was a son 
line 14799=>of deeper shade among the shadows across the  road, just beyond the edge  of 
line 14800=>the lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was 
line 14801=>no horse.' 
line 14802=>     'Which  way  did  it  go?'  asked Strider, suddenly  and sharply. Merry 
line 14803=>started, noticing the  stranger for the  first  time. 'Go  on!' said  Frodo. 
line 14804=>'This is a friend of Gandalf's. I will explain later.' 
line 14805=>     'It seemed to make  off  up  the  Road,  eastward,' continued Merry. 'I  
line 14806=>tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the 
line 14807=>corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.' 
line 14808=>     Strider looked at Merry with wonder. 'You have a stout heart,' he said; 
line 14809=>'but it was foolish.' 
line 14810=>     'I don't know,' said Merry. 'Neither brave nor silly, I  think. I could 
line 14811=>hardly  help myself.  I  seemed to be drawn  somehow.  Anyway,  I  went, and 
line 14812=>suddenly I heard voices by the hedge. One was muttering; and the  other  was 
line 14813=>whispering,  or  hissing. I  couldn't hear a word  that was said. I did  not 
line 14814=>creep  any  closer,  because  I  began  to  tremble  all over. Then  I  felt 
line 14815=>terrified,  and I  turned  back,  and was  just  going  to  bolt  home, when 
line 14816=>something came behind me and I... I fell over.' 
line 14817=>     'I  found  him,  sir,'  put in Nob.  'Mr. Butterbur sent me out with  a  
line 14818=>lantern. I went down to West -gate, and then back up towards South-gate. Just 
line 14819=>nigh  Bill Ferny's  house I thought  I could see  something in  the  Road. I  
line 14820=>couldn't swear to  it, but it  looked to me as if two men was  stooping over  
line 14821=>something, lilting  it. I gave a shout, but where I got up to the spot there 
line 14822=>was  no  signs  of them,  and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by  the roadside. He 
line 14823=>seemed to be asleep. "I thought I had  fallen into  deep  water," he says to 
line 14824=>me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he 
line 14825=>got up and ran back here like a hare. ' 
line 14826=>     'I am  afraid that's true,'  said Merry, 'though I  don't know  what  I 
line 14827=>said. I had an ugly dream, which I can't remember. I went to pieces. I don't  
line 14828=>know what came over me.' 
line 14829=>     'I  do,' said Strider.  'The Black Breath. The  Riders  must have  left 
line 14830=>their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate in secret. They  
line 14831=>will know all the news now, for  they have visited  Bill Ferny; and probably  
line 14832=>that Southerner was a spy as well. Something may happen in the night, before 
line 14833=>
line 14834=>####-we leave Bree.' 
line 14835=>     'What  will happen?'  said  Merry.  'Will they attack the inn?'  'No, I 
line 14836=>think not,' said Strider.  'They are not all here yet. And in any  case that 
line 14837=>is not their way. In dark and loneliness  they are strongest; they will  not 
line 14838=>openly attack a house where ther e are lights and many people -not until they 
line 14839=>are desperate, not while all the  long  leagues of Eriador still  lie before 
line 14840=>us.  But their  power  is in  terror, and already some in Bree are in  their 
line 14841=>clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of 
line 14842=>the strangers, and, maybe,  the gatekeeper too. They had words with Harry at 
line 14843=>West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when 
line 14844=>they 
line 14845=>left him.' 
line 14846=>     'We seem to have enemies all round,' said Frodo. 'What are we to do? ' 
line 14847=>     'Stay here, and do not  go to  your rooms! They are sure  to have found 
line 14848=>out which those  are. The hobbit-rooms  have windows looking north and close 
line 14849=>to the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and the door. 
line 14850=>But first Nob and I will fetch your luggage.' 
line 14851=>     While Strider was  gone, Frodo gave Merry a  rapid account of all  that 
line 14852=>had happened since supper. Merry was  still reading and  pondering Gandalf's 
line 14853=>letter when Strider and Nob returned. 
line 14854=>     'Well Masters,' said  Nob, 'I've ruffled up  the clothes  and  put in a  
line 14855=>bolster down the  middle of  each bed.  And I made a  nice imitation of your  
line 14856=>head  with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag  - Underhill,  sir,' he added with  a  
line 14857=>grin. 
line 14858=>     Pippin laughed. 'Very life-like!'  he said. 'But  wha t will happen when 
line 14859=>they have penetrated the disguise?' 
line 14860=>     'We shall  see,'  said  Strider.  'Let us hope  to hold the  fort  till 
line 14861=>morning.' 
line 14862=>     'Good  night to  you,' said Nob, and went off to take  his part in  the 
line 14863=>watch on the doors.  
line 14864=>     Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour -floor. They pushed a  low 
line 14865=>chair against the door and shut the window. Peering  out, Frodo saw that the 
line 14866=>night was still clear. The Sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of  
line 14867=>Bree-hill. He then closed and barred  the heavy inside shutters and drew the  
line 14868=>curtains together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.  
line 14869=>     The  hobbits lay  down  on their blankets  with their feet  towards the 
line 14870=>hearth; but  Strider settled himself  in the chair against  the  door .  They 
line 14871=>
line 14872=>####-talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask. 
line 14873=>     'Jumped over  the Moon!'  chuckled  Merry as he rolled himself  in  his 
line 14874=>blanket. 'Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish I had been there to see. 
line 14875=>The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence.' 
line 14876=>     'I  hope so,' said Strider. Then  they all fell  silent, and one by one 
line 14877=>the hobbits dropped off to sleep. 
line 14878=> 
line 14879=>
line 14880=>####- 
line 14881=>
line 14882=>Chapter 11. A Knife in the Dark 
line 14883=>
line 14884=> 
line 14885=> 
line 14886=>     As  they prepared  for sleep  in  the  inn at  Bree,  darkness  lay  on 
line 14887=>Buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river -bank. The house at 
line 14888=>Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered 
line 14889=>out. A feeling of fear had been growing on him all day, and he was unable to 
line 14890=>rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat  in the breathless night-air. 
line 14891=>As he  stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees;  the 
line 14892=>gate  seemed  to open  of its own  accord and close again without  a  sound. 
line 14893=>Terror seized him. He  shrank  back,  and for a moment he stood trembling in 
line 14894=>the hall. Then he shut and locked the door. 
line 14895=>     The night  deepened.  There  came  the  soft  sound of horses  led with 
line 14896=>stealth  along the  lane.  Outside  the gate  they stopped, and three  black  
line 14897=>figures entered,  like shades of night  creeping across the ground. One went 
line 14898=>to the door, one to the corner of the house on  either side; and there  they 
line 14899=>stood, as  still as the shadows of  stones, while night went slowly on.  The 
line 14900=>house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly. 
line 14901=>     There was a faint stir  in the leaves, and  a cock crowed far away. The 
line 14902=>cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the door moved. In the dark 
line 14903=>without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed,  as  if a chill light had  been 
line 14904=>unsheathed.  There was a blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered. 
line 14905=>     'Open, in the name of Mordor!' said a voice thin and menacing. 
line 14906=>     At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and 
line 14907=>lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in. 
line 14908=>     At that moment, among the trees nearby,  a  horn rang out.  It rent the 
line 14909=>night like fire on a hill-top. 
line 14910=>     AWAKE! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! AWAKE! 
line 14911=>     Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep 
line 14912=>from the garden, he knew that he must run for it, or perish. And run he did, 
line 14913=>out  of the  back door, through  the garden,  and over the  fields.  When he 
line 14914=>reached  the  nearest  house,  more  than a mile  away, he  collapsed on the 
line 14915=>doorstep. 'No, no, no!'  he was  crying. 'No,  not me! I haven't got it!' It 
line 14916=>was  some time  before anyone could make out what he  was babbling about. 
line 14917=>At 
line 14918=>last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some strange  invasion 
line 14919=>
line 14920=>####-from the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time. 
line 14921=>     FEAR! FIRE! FOES! 
line 14922=>     The Brandybucks were blowing  the Horn-call of  Buckland,  that had not 
line 14923=>been sounded for  a hundred years, not  since the white wolves came  in  the 
line 14924=>Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over. 
line 14925=>     AWAKE! AWAKE! 
line 14926=>     Far-away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading. The black  
line 14927=>figures fled from the house.  One  of them  let fall a  hobbit-cloak  on the 
line 14928=>step, as he ran. In the lane the noise  of hoofs broke out, and gathering to 
line 14929=>a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. All about Crickhollow there 
line 14930=>was the sound  of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the 
line 14931=>Black Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate. Let the little people blow!  
line 14932=>Sauron  would deal  with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they 
line 14933=>knew now that the house  was empty and the Ring had gone. They rode down 
line 14934=>the 
line 14935=>guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire. 
line 14936=>     In  the early night  Frodo woke from deep  sleep, suddenly, as if  some 
line 14937=>sound or presence  had disturbed  him. He saw that Strider was sitting alert 
line 14938=>in his  chair: his  eyes gleamed in  the light of the  fire, which had  been 
line 14939=>tended and was burning brightly; but he made no sign or movement. 
line 14940=>     Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with  
line 14941=>the noise  of wind and of ga lloping  hoofs.  The wind  seemed to be  curling  
line 14942=>round the house and shaking it; and far off  he heard a horn blowing wildly.  
line 14943=>He  opened his  eyes,  and  heard a  cock  crowing  lustily in the inn-yard. 
line 14944=>Strider  had  drawn the  curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang. 
line 14945=>The  first  grey light of day  was in the room, and  a  cold  air was coming 
line 14946=>through the open window.  
line 14947=>     As soon  as  Strider  had roused them  all,  he led  the  way  to their 
line 14948=>bedrooms. When they  saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice: 
line 14949=>the windows had been forced  open and were  swinging, and  the curtains were 
line 14950=>flapping; the beds  were tossed about,  and the bolsters  slashed and  flung 
line 14951=>upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces. 
line 14952=>     Strider  immediately  went  to fetch the landlord. Poor  Mr.  Butterbur 
line 14953=>looked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed his eyes all night (so he 
line 14954=>said), but he had never heard a sound. 
line 14955=>     'Never has such  a thing happened  in my  time!' he cried,  raising his 
line 14956=>hands in horror. 'Guests unable to sleep in  their beds,  and good  bolsters 
line 14957=>
line 14958=>####-ruined and all! What are we coming to?' 
line 14959=>     'Dark times,' said  Strider. 'But for  the present you  may be left  in 
line 14960=>peace,  when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once. Never mind about 
line 14961=>breakfast: a drink  and a bite standing will have to do. We shall be  packed 
line 14962=>in a few minutes.' 
line 14963=>     Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were  got ready, and 
line 14964=>to fetch them a 'bite'. But very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had 
line 14965=>vanished!  The stable-doors had all  been opened in the night, and they were 
line 14966=>gone: not only Merry's ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place. 
line 14967=>     Frodo was  crushed by the news. How  could they hope to reach Rivendell 
line 14968=>on foot, pursued  by  mounted enemies? They might as  well  set  out for the 
line 14969=>Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits,  as if he  was 
line 14970=>weighing up their strength and courage. 
line 14971=>     'Ponies would  not help  us to  escape  horsemen,'  he  said  at  last, 
line 14972=>thoughtfully, as if he guessed  what Frodo  had in  mind. 'We should  not go 
line 14973=>much slower on foot, not  on the roads that I mean to take.  I was  going to 
line 14974=>walk in any case. It is the food and stores that trouble me. We cannot count 
line 14975=>on getting anything to  eat between here and Rivendell, except  what we take 
line 14976=>with  us; and we ought to take plenty  to spare; for we  may be delayed,  or  
line 14977=>forced  to  go round-about, far out  of  the direct way.  How much  are  you  
line 14978=>prepared to carry on your backs?' 
line 14979=>     'As  much as we must,' said Pippin with  a sinking heart, but trying to 
line 14980=>show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt). 
line 14981=>     'I can carry enough for two,' said Sam defiantly. 
line 14982=>     'Can't  anything be done,  Mr. Butterbur?' asked Frodo. 'Can't we get a  
line 14983=>couple of  ponies in the vi llage, or even one  just for the baggage? I don't  
line 14984=>suppose we  could  hire  them, but we might be able to buy them,' he  added,  
line 14985=>doubtfully, wondering if he could afford it. 
line 14986=>     'I  doubt  it,'  said   the  landlord  unhappily.  'The  two  or  three 
line 14987=>riding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled  in  my yard, and they're 
line 14988=>gone.  As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there 
line 14989=>are very few of them in Bree, and they won't be for sale. But I'll do what I 
line 14990=>can. I'll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be.' 
line 14991=>     'Yes,' said Strider reluctantly, 'you  had better do that. I am  afraid 
line 14992=>we  shall have to try  to get  one pony at least. But so ends  all  hope  of 
line 14993=>starting early,  and  slipping away quietly! We might as  well have  blown a  
line 14994=>horn to announce our departure. That was part of their plan, no doubt.' 
line 14995=>
line 14996=>####-     'There is one crumb of comfort,' said Merry, 'and more than a  crumb, I 
line 14997=>hope: we  can have  breakfast while we wait  - and sit down to it.  Let's get 
line 14998=>hold of Nob!' 
line 14999=>     In the end there was more  than three hours'  delay. Bob came back with 
line 15000=>the  report  that  no horse or pony was to be got for love  or  money in the 
line 15001=>neighbourhood - except one: Bill Ferny had  one that he might possibly sell.  
line 15002=>'A poor old half-starved creature it is,'  said Bob; 'but he won't part with 
line 15003=>it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how  you're placed, not if I knows 
line 15004=>Bill Ferny.' 
line 15005=>     'Bill  Ferny?'  said Frodo. 'Isn't there some trick? Wouldn't the beast  
line 15006=>bolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?' 
line 15007=>     'I wonder,' said Strider. 'But I cannot imagine any animal running home 
line 15008=>to him, once  it got  away.  I  fancy this  is only an  afterthought of kind 
line 15009=>Master  Ferny's: just a  way of increasing his profits  from the affair. The 
line 15010=>chief  danger is that the poor beast is probably at  death's door. But there 
line 15011=>does not seem any choice. What does he want for it?' 
line 15012=>     Bill Ferny's price was twelve  silver pennies; and  that  was indeed at 
line 15013=>least  three times the pony's value in those pans. It  proved to  be a bony, 
line 15014=>underfed, and dispirited  animal; but  it did  not look like dying just yet. 
line 15015=>Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself, and offered Merry  another eighteen pence 
line 15016=>as  some  compensation  for  the  lost animals. He was an  honest  man,   and 
line 15017=>well-off as things were reckoned  in Bree;  but thirty silver pennies was  a  
line 15018=>sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder to bear. 
line 15019=>     As a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It turned 
line 15020=>out later that only one  horse had been actually stolen. The others had been 
line 15021=>driven off, or  had  bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different 
line 15022=>corners  of  the  Bree-land.  Merry's  ponies  had  escaped altogether,  and 
line 15023=>eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in 
line 15024=>search of Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under  the care  of Tom Bombadil for a  
line 15025=>while, and were well-off. But when  news of the events at Bree came to Tom's 
line 15026=>ears, he sent them to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very 
line 15027=>fair price. They had  to work harder in Bree, but  Bob treated them well; so 
line 15028=>on the whole  they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey. But 
line 15029=>they never came to Rivendell. 
line 15030=>     However, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone 
line 15031=>for  good, or  for bad.  And he had other troubles. For  there  was a  great 
line 15032=>commotion as soon as  the remaining  guests were astir and heard news of the 
line 15033=>
line 15034=>####-raid  on the inn. The southern travellers had lost several horses and blamed 
line 15035=>the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had 
line 15036=>also  disappeared  in the  night,  none  other than Bill Ferny's squint-eyed 
line 15037=>companion. Suspicion fell on him at once. 
line 15038=>     'If you pick up with  a  horse-thief, and  bring him to my house,' said 
line 15039=>Butterbur angrily, 'you ought to pay  for all the damage yourselves and  not 
line 15040=>come shouting at me. Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is!' But it 
line 15041=>appeared that he was nobody's friend, and nobody could recollect when he had 
line 15042=>joined their party. 
line 15043=>     After  their  breakfast the  hobbits had to re-pack,  and get  together  
line 15044=>further  supplies for  the  longer  journey  they were now expecting. It was 
line 15045=>close on ten o'clock before they at last got off. By  that time the whole of 
line 15046=>Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo's vanishing trick; the appearance of 
line 15047=>the black  horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that 
line 15048=>Strider  the Ranger  had joined the  mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as 
line 15049=>would last for  many  uneventful years. Most of  the inhabitants of Bree and  
line 15050=>Staddle, and many  even  from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the  road 
line 15051=>to 
line 15052=>see the travellers start. The other  guests in  the inn were at the doors or  
line 15053=>hanging out of the windows. 
line 15054=>     Strider had changed his mind, and  he decided  to leave Bree by the main 
line 15055=>road. Any attempt to set  off across country at once would only make matters 
line 15056=>worse: half the inhabitants would follow them,  to see what they were up to,  
line 15057=>and to prevent them from trespassing. 
line 15058=>     They said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr. Butterbur with 
line 15059=>many thanks. 'I  hope we shall  meet again some  day, when things are  merry 
line 15060=>once more,' said Frodo. 'I  should like nothing better than  to stay in your 
line 15061=>house in peace for a while.' 
line 15062=>     They tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd. 
line 15063=>Not  all  the faces were friendly, nor all the words that were shouted.  But 
line 15064=>Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that 
line 15065=>he stared at shut their mouths and drew away. He walked in  front with Frodo; 
line 15066=>next came  Merry  and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony,  which was 
line 15067=>laden with as much  of their baggage as  they  had the heart to give it; but 
line 15068=>already it looked less dejected,  as  if  it approved of the  change in  its 
line 15069=>fortunes.  Sam  was chewing an  apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full  of 
line 15070=>them:  a parting  present from Nob and  Bob. 'Apples for walking, and a pipe 
line 15071=>
line 15072=>####-for sitting,' he said. 'But I reckon I'll miss them both before long.' 
line 15073=>     The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped  out of 
line 15074=>doors,  or  popped over walls and fences,  as they passed. But as they  drew 
line 15075=>near to  the further gate, Frodo saw a  dark  ill-kept  house behind a thick  
line 15076=>hedge: the  last  house  in the village.  In one of the  windows he caught a  
line 15077=>glimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once. 
line 15078=>     'So that's where that southerner is hiding!' he thought. 'He looks more 
line 15079=>than half like a goblin.' 
line 15080=>     Over the hedge  another  man  was  staring boldly.  He  had heavy black  
line 15081=>brows, and  dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in  a  sneer.  He was 
line 15082=>smoking a  short black pipe. As they approached he took it out  of his mouth 
line 15083=>and spat. 
line 15084=>     'Morning,  Longshanks!' he  said.  'Off  early?  Found some  friends at 
line 15085=>last?' Strider nodded, but did not answer.  'Morning, my little friends!' he 
line 15086=>said  to the  others. 'I suppose you know who you've taken  up  with? That's 
line 15087=>Stick -at-naught  Strider,  that is!  Though  I've  heard other names not  so 
line 15088=>pretty.  Watch out tonight! And you,  Sammie, don't  go ill-treating my poor  
line 15089=>old pony! Pah!' He spat again. 
line 15090=>     Sam turned quickly. 'And you.  Ferny,' he said, 'put your ugly face out 
line 15091=>of sight, or it will get  hurt.' With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an 
line 15092=>apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose. He ducked too late, and 
line 15093=>curses  came from  behind  the  hedge.  'Waste  of a  good apple,'  said Sam 
line 15094=>regretfully, and strode on. 
line 15095=>     At last  they  left  the  village  behind. The  escort of children  and 
line 15096=>stragglers  that  had  followed  them  got  tired  and  turned  back at  the 
line 15097=>South-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some  miles. It  
line 15098=>bent to the left, curving back into its eastward line as it rounded the feet 
line 15099=>of  Bree-hill,  and  then  it  began to run  swiftly downwards  into  wooded 
line 15100=>country. To their left they could see some of the houses and hobbit-holes of 
line 15101=>Staddle on the  gentler  south-eastern  slopes of  the hill; down in  a deep 
line 15102=>hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising  smoke  that showed 
line 15103=>where Combe lay; 
line 15104=>     Archet was hidden in the trees beyond. 
line 15105=>     After the  Road had run down some way, and  had left Bree-hill standing 
line 15106=>tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards  the 
line 15107=>North. 'This is where we leave  the open and take to cover,' said Strider. 
line 15108=>     'Not a "short cut", I hope,' said  Pippin.  'Our last short cut through 
line 15109=>
line 15110=>####-woods nearly ended in disaster.' 
line 15111=>     'Ah, but you had not  got me with you then,' laughed Strider. 'My cuts,  
line 15112=>short  or long, don't go wrong.' He took a look up and down the Road. No one 
line 15113=>was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley. 
line 15114=>     His  plan, as  far as  they  could understand  it without  knowing  the 
line 15115=>country, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right and pass it on 
line 15116=>the  east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands  to 
line 15117=>Weathertop Hill. In that way they  would, if all went well,  cut off a great 
line 15118=>loop of the Road,  which  further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater  
line 15119=>Marshes.  But,  of  course, they  would have  to  pass  through  the marshes 
line 15120=>themselves, and Strider's description of them was not encouraging. 
line 15121=>     However,  in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant.  Indeed, if  it 
line 15122=>had not been for the disturbing events  of the night before, they would have 
line 15123=>enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any up to that time. The sun was 
line 15124=>shining, clear but not too hot. The woods in the valley were still leafy and 
line 15125=>full  of  colour, and  seemed  peaceful  and wholesome. Strider   guided them 
line 15126=>confidently among the many crossing paths, although left  to themselves they 
line 15127=>would soon have  been at  a loss. He was taking a wandering course with many 
line 15128=>turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit. 
line 15129=>     'Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,'  he 
line 15130=>said;  'though I don't think he  will follow  us himself. He  knows the land 
line 15131=>round here well enough, but he knows he is not a  match for me in a wood. It 
line 15132=>is what he may tell others that I am afraid of. I don't suppose they are far 
line 15133=>away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better.' 
line 15134=>     Whether because  of Strider's skill or for some other reason,  they saw 
line 15135=>no sign and heard no  sound of any other living thing all  that day: neither  
line 15136=>two-footed,  except  birds;  nor  four-footed,  except  one  fox  and  a  few 
line 15137=>squirrels. The next day  they began to steer a steady  course eastwards; and 
line 15138=>still all was quiet and  peaceful. On  the third day out from Bree they came  
line 15139=>out of  the  Chetwood. The  land  had been falling steadily, ever since they 
line 15140=>turned aside from the  Road,  and they  now  entered a wide flat expanse  of 
line 15141=>country, much more difficult to manage. They were  far beyond the borders of 
line 15142=>the Bree-land,  out in the  pathless  wilderness, and  drawing  near  to the 
line 15143=>Midge-water Marshes.  
line 15144=>     The ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they 
line 15145=>came  upon pools, and  wide  stretches of reeds  and rushes filled with  the 
line 15146=>warbling of little hidden  birds. They  had to pick their  way  carefully to 
line 15147=>
line 15148=>####-keep  both  dry-footed and  on  their  proper  course.  At  first  they made 
line 15149=>fan-progress,  but as  they  went on, their passage  became slower  and more 
line 15150=>dangerous.  The marshes were bewildering and  treacherous, and there was  no 
line 15151=>permanent trail even for Rangers  to find through their shifting  quagmires.  
line 15152=>The  flies began  to torment them, and the air was full  of  clouds of  tiny 
line 15153=>midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their hair. 
line 15154=>     'I  am being eaten alive!'  cried  Pippin. 'Midgewater!  There are more 
line 15155=>midges than water!' 
line 15156=>     'What  do  they live  on  when  they  can't  get  hobbit?'  asked  Sam, 
line 15157=>scratching his neck. 
line 15158=>     They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. Their 
line 15159=>camping-place  was  damp, cold,  and uncomfortable;  and the  biting insects 
line 15160=>would not let  them sleep. There were also abominable creatures haunting the 
line 15161=>reeds  and tussocks that from  the sound  of them were evil relatives of the 
line 15162=>cricket.  There  were  thousands  of  them,  and  they  squeaked all  round, 
line 15163=>neek-breek,  breek-neek, unceasingly all the night, until the  hobbits  were 
line 15164=>nearly frantic. 
line 15165=>     The  next day,  the fourth, was little  better, and the night almost as 
line 15166=>comfortless. Though  the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called them)  had been  left  
line 15167=>behind, the midges still pursued them. 
line 15168=>     As Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that 
line 15169=>far away  there came  a light in the eastern sky: it  flashed and faded many 
line 15170=>times. It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off.  
line 15171=>     'What is the  light?'  he said  to  Strider,  who had  risen,  and  was 
line 15172=>standing, gazing ahead into the night. 
line 15173=>     'I do  not know,' Strider answered. 'It is too distant to make  out. It 
line 15174=>is like lightning that leaps up from the hill -tops.' 
line 15175=>     Frodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white 
line 15176=>flashes, and against them the tall dark figure  of Strider,  standing silent 
line 15177=>and watchful. At last he passed into uneasy sleep. 
line 15178=>     They had not  gone  far  on  the  fifth day  when  they  left  the last  
line 15179=>straggling pools and  reed-beds of the marshes  behind them. The land before 
line 15180=>them began steadily  to rise again. Away in the distance eastward they could 
line 15181=>now  see a line of hills. The highest of them was at the  right of  the line 
line 15182=>and  a little  separated from the  others. It  had a  conical top,  slightly 
line 15183=>flattened at the summit. 
line 15184=>     'That  is Weathertop,' said Strider. 'The Old Road,  which we have left  
line 15185=>
line 15186=>####-far  away on our right, runs to the south  of it and passes not far from its 
line 15187=>foot. We  might  reach it by noon tomorrow, if we  go straight towards it. I 
line 15188=>suppose we had better do so.' 
line 15189=>     'What do you mean?' asked Frodo. 
line 15190=>     'I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. It 
line 15191=>is close to the Road.' 
line 15192=>     'But surely we wer e hoping to find Gandalf there?' 
line 15193=>     'Yes; but the hope is faint.  If he comes  this way at  all, he may not 
line 15194=>pass through  Bree, and so  he may not know  what we  are doing. And anyway, 
line 15195=>unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; it will 
line 15196=>not be safe for him or for us to wait there long. If the Riders fail to find 
line 15197=>us in the wilderness,  they are likely to make for Weathertop themselves. It 
line 15198=>commands a wide view all round. Indeed, there  are many birds and  beasts in 
line 15199=>this country that  could see us,  as we stand here, from that hill-top.  Not 
line 15200=>all the  birds are to be trusted,  and there are other spies more  evil than 
line 15201=>they are.' 
line 15202=>     The hobbits looked  anxiously at  the distant hills. Sam looked up into 
line 15203=>the pale sky, fearing to see hawks  or eagles hovering over them with bright  
line 15204=>unfriendly eyes. 'You do make me feel uncomfortable  and lonesome, Strider!' 
line 15205=>he said. 
line 15206=>     'What do you advise us to do?' asked Frodo. 
line 15207=>     'I  think,' answered Strider  slowly, as  if he was not quite sure,  'I 
line 15208=>think the best thing is to  go as straight eastward from  here as we can, to 
line 15209=>make for the line of hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike a path I 
line 15210=>know that runs at their feet; it will  bring us to Weathertop from the north 
line 15211=>and less openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.' 
line 15212=>     All that day they plodded along, until the cold  and early evening came 
line 15213=>down.  The  land  became  drier and more barren;  but  mists and vapours lay 
line 15214=>behind them on the marshes. A few melancholy  birds were piping and wa iling, 
line 15215=>until the round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows; then  an empty 
line 15216=>silence fell.  The hobbits  thought  of  the  soft light of sunset  glancing 
line 15217=>through the cheerful windows of Bag End far away. 
line 15218=>     At  the day's  end  they came to a stream  that wandered  down from the 
line 15219=>hills to lose  itself  in the stagnant marshland, and they went up along its 
line 15220=>banks while the light  lasted. It was already night when at last they halted 
line 15221=>and made  their  camp under some stunted alder -trees  by  the shores of  the 
line 15222=>stream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky  sky the bleak and treeless 
line 15223=>
line 15224=>####-backs of the hills. That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did 
line 15225=>not  sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and in the early night-hours a  cold 
line 15226=>grey light lay on the land. 
line 15227=>     Next morning they set out  again soon after sunrise.  There was a frost  
line 15228=>in the air, and the  sky was a  pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, 
line 15229=>as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used 
line 15230=>to much walking  on short commons  - shorter  at  any rate than  what in the  
line 15231=>Shire they  would have thought barely enough  to  keep them  on  their legs.  
line 15232=>Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been. 
line 15233=>     'Very odd,' said Frodo, tightening his belt, 'considering that there is 
line 15234=>actually a good deal less of me. I hope the  thinning process will not go on 
line 15235=>indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.' 
line 15236=>     'Do  not  speak  of  such  things!'  said  Strider  quickly,  and  with 
line 15237=>surprising earnestness.  
line 15238=>     The  hills drew nearer.  They  made an  undulating  ridge, often rising 
line 15239=>almost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or  
line 15240=>passes leading into  the eastern land  beyond.  Along the crest of the ridge 
line 15241=>the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and 
line 15242=>dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins  of old works of stone. 
line 15243=>By night they had reached  the feet of the westward  slopes, and there  they 
line 15244=>camped. It was the night of the fifth of October, a nd they were six days out 
line 15245=>from Bree. 
line 15246=>     In the morning  they  found, for the first time since they had left the 
line 15247=>Chetwood,  a  track  plain  to  see.  They  turned  right  and  followed  it 
line 15248=>southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep  
line 15249=>as much hidden as possible from the view, both of the hill -tops above and of 
line 15250=>the  flats to the west. It dived into  dells,  and hugged steep  banks;  and 
line 15251=>where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there 
line 15252=>were lines of large  boulders and hewn stones that  screened the  travellers 
line 15253=>almost like a hedge. 
line 15254=>     'I wonder who made this path, and what for,' said Merry, as they walked 
line 15255=>along one of  these  avenues, where  the  stones  were unusually  large  and 
line 15256=>closely  set. 'I am  not  sure that I like  it: it  has  a - well, rather  a  
line 15257=>barrow-wightish look. Is there any barrow on Weathertop?' 
line 15258=>     'No. There  is no barrow on  Weathertop, nor  on  any of these  hills,' 
line 15259=>answered Strider. 'The  Men of  the West  did not live here; though in their 
line 15260=>latter days they defended  the hills for a while against  the evil that came 
line 15261=>
line 15262=>####-out of Angmar.  This  path was made to serve the  forts along the walls. But 
line 15263=>long before,  in the first  days of  the North  Kingdom, they built  a great 
line 15264=>watch-tower  on  Weathertop,  Amon  Syl  they called  it.  It was burned and 
line 15265=>broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a rough crown 
line 15266=>on  the old hill's head.  Yet once it was tall and  fair.  It is  told  that 
line 15267=>Elendil stood there watching for the coming of Gil-galad out of the West, in 
line 15268=>the days of the Last Alliance.' 
line 15269=>     The  hobbits gazed  at Strider. It seemed  that he  was  learned in old 
line 15270=>lore, as well as in  the ways of the wild. 'Who was Gil-galad?' asked Merry; 
line 15271=>but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low 
line 15272=>voice murmured: 
line 15273=>     Gil-galad was an Elven-king. 
line 15274=>     Of him the harpers sadly sing: 
line 15275=>     the last whose realm was fair and free 
line 15276=>     between the Mountains and the Sea. 
line 15277=> 
line 15278=>     His sword was long, his lance was keen, 
line 15279=>     his shining helm afar was seen; 
line 15280=>     the countless stars of heaven's field  
line 15281=>     were mirrored in his silver shield. 
line 15282=> 
line 15283=>     But long ago he rode away, 
line 15284=>     and where he dwelleth none can say; 
line 15285=>     for into darkness fell his star 
line 15286=>     in Mordor where the shadows are. 
line 15287=>     The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam's. 
line 15288=>     'Don't stop!' said Merry. 
line 15289=>     'That's all I know,' stammered  Sam, blushing.  'I learned  it from Mr. 
line 15290=>Bilbo when I was a lad. He used to  tell me tales  like that, knowing  how I 
line 15291=>was always one for  hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo  as taught  me  my 
line 15292=>letters.  He was  mighty  book -learned was dear  old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote 
line 15293=>poetry. He wrote what I have just said.' 
line 15294=>     'He did  not make it up,' said Strider. 'It  is pan of the lay  that is 
line 15295=>called The Fall of Gil-galad, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have 
line 15296=>translated it. I never knew that.' 
line 15297=>     'There was a lot more,' said Sam,  'all about  Mordor.  I  didn't learn 
line 15298=>that part, it gave me the shivers I never thought I should be going that way 
line 15299=>
line 15300=>####-myself!' 
line 15301=>     'Going to Mordor!' cried Pippin. 'I hope it won't come to that!' 
line 15302=>     'Do not speak that name so loudly!' said Strider. 
line 15303=>     It was  already  mid-day  when they  drew near the southern end of  the 
line 15304=>path, and saw before them,  in the pale  clear light  of the  October sun, a  
line 15305=>grey-green bank, leading up like a  bridge on to  the northward slope of the 
line 15306=>hill They decided to make for the top at once,  while the daylight was broad 
line 15307=>Concealment was no longer  possible,  and they could only hope that no enemy 
line 15308=>or spy was observing  them. Nothing  was to be seen  moving  on the hill. If 
line 15309=>Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him. 
line 15310=>     On the western flank  of Weathertop they  found a  sheltered hollow, at 
line 15311=>the  bottom of which  there was  a bowl -shaped dell with grassy sides. There 
line 15312=>they left  Sam  and Pippin with the pony and  their  packs and  luggage. The 
line 15313=>other three went on. After half an hour's plodding climb Strider reached the 
line 15314=>crown  of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last  
line 15315=>slope had been steep and rocky. 
line 15316=>     On  the top they found,  as  Strider had said,  a wide  ring of ancient 
line 15317=>stonework, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass. But in the centre a  
line 15318=>cairn of broken st ones had been piled. They were blackened as  if with fire. 
line 15319=>About them  the turf  was  burned to the roots and all within the  ring  the 
line 15320=>grass was scorched  and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hill-top; but 
line 15321=>there was no sign of any living thing. 
line 15322=>     Standing upon the  rim of the ruined circle,  they saw all round  below 
line 15323=>them a  wide  prospect,  for the most pan of  lands empty  and  featureless,  
line 15324=>except for patches of woodland away to the  south, beyond which  they caught 
line 15325=>here and  there  the glint of  distant water. Beneath them  on this southern 
line 15326=>side there  ran  like  a  ribbon  the Old Road,  coming  out of the West and 
line 15327=>winding up and down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east. 
line 15328=>Nothing was moving on it. Following  its line eastward  with their eyes they  
line 15329=>saw the Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; 
line 15330=>     behind them stood taller shapes of  grey, and  behind  those again were 
line 15331=>high white peaks glimmering among the clouds. 
line 15332=>     'Well, here we are!' said Merry. 'And very  cheerless and uninviting it 
line 15333=>looks! There is no water and no shelter. And no sign of Gandalf. But I don't  
line 15334=>blame him for not waiting - if he ever came here.' 
line 15335=>     'I wonder,' said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. 'Even if he was a  
line 15336=>day or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived here first.  He can ride 
line 15337=>
line 15338=>####-very swiftly when need presses.' Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone 
line 15339=>on the top of the  cairn; it was flatter than the others, and  whiter, as if 
line 15340=>it had escaped the fire. He picked it up and examined it, turning  it in his 
line 15341=>fingers. "This has been  handled recently,' he said.  'What do you  think of 
line 15342=>these marks?' 
line 15343=>     On  the flat under -side Frodo saw  some scratches: 'There seems to he a  
line 15344=>stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,' he said. 
line 15345=>     'The stroke  on the left  might  be a G-rune  with thin branches,' said 
line 15346=>Strider. 'It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The 
line 15347=>scratches are fine, and they certainly look fresh. But the  marks might mean 
line 15348=>something  quite  different, and have  nothing  to do  with us.  Rangers use 
line 15349=>runes, and they come here sometimes.' 
line 15350=>     'What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?' asked Merry 
line 15351=>     'I  should say,' answered Strider, 'that they stood for G3, and  were a  
line 15352=>sign that Gandalf was here on  October the third: that is three days ago now. 
line 15353=>It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he 
line 15354=>had no time or  did not dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is 
line 15355=>so, we must be wary.' 
line 15356=>     'I wish we could  feel  sure that he made  the marks, whatever they may 
line 15357=>mean,' said Frodo 'It would be a  great  comfort to  know that he was on the 
line 15358=>way, in front of us or behind us.' 
line 15359=>     'Perhaps,' said  Strider. 'For myself, I believe that he was  here, and 
line 15360=>was in danger. There have been scorching flames here; and now the light that 
line 15361=>we saw three  nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to  my  mind. I guess 
line 15362=>that he was attacked on this hill-top,  but with what result  I cannot tell. 
line 15363=>He  is here no longer, and we must now look aft er ourselves and make our own 
line 15364=>way to Rivendell, as best we can ' 
line 15365=>     'How far  is  Rivendell?' asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The  world 
line 15366=>looked wild and wide from Weathertop. 
line 15367=>     'I don't know if the Road has  ever  been measured in miles  beyond the 
line 15368=>Forsaken Inn, a day's  journey east of Bree,' answered Strider. 'Some say it 
line 15369=>is so far, and some say otherwise. It is a strange road,  and folk are  glad 
line 15370=>to reach their  journey's end, whether the time is long or short. But I know 
line 15371=>how long it would  take me on  my  own  feet,  with fair  weather and no ill 
line 15372=>fortune twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses 
line 15373=>the Loudwater that  runs  out of Rivendell. We  have at  least a fortnight's 
line 15374=>journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the Road.' 
line 15375=>
line 15376=>####-     'A fortnight!' said Frodo. 'A lot may happen in that time.' 
line 15377=>     'It may,' said Strider. 
line 15378=>     They stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its southward edge. 
line 15379=>In  that  lonely  place   Frodo  for  the  first  time  fully  realized  his 
line 15380=>homelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in 
line 15381=>the quiet  and beloved Shire.  He  stared down at the hateful Road,  leading 
line 15382=>back westward  - to his  home.  Suddenly he  was aware that  two black specks 
line 15383=>were moving slowly along  it,  going westward; and looking again he saw that 
line 15384=>three others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave a cry and clutched 
line 15385=>Strider's arm. 
line 15386=>     'Look,' he said, pointing downwards.  
line 15387=>     At once Strider flung  himself on  the ground behind the ruined circle, 
line 15388=>pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside. 
line 15389=>     'What is it?' he whispered. 
line 15390=>     'I do not know, but I fear the worst,' answered Strider. 
line 15391=>     Slowly  they crawled  up  to the edge of  the  ring  again,  and peered 
line 15392=>through a cleft  between two jagged  stones. The light was no longer bright, 
line 15393=>for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping out of the East had now 
line 15394=>overtaken  the sun,  as it  began to go  down.  They could all see the black  
line 15395=>specks, but neither Frodo nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; 
line 15396=>yet something told them that there, far below, were Black  Riders assembling 
line 15397=>on the Road beyond the foot of the hill. 
line 15398=>     'Yes,'  said  Strider,  whose keener sight left him  in no  doubt. 'The 
line 15399=>enemy is here!' 
line 15400=>     Hastily they crept away  and slipped down the north side of the hill to 
line 15401=>find their companions.  
line 15402=>     Sam and  Peregrin had not been  idle. They  had explored the small dell 
line 15403=>and the surrounding slopes. Not far away they  found a spring of clear water  
line 15404=>in the hillside, and near it footprints not  more than  a day or two old. In 
line 15405=>the dell itself they  found  recent traces of a fire, and  other  signs of a  
line 15406=>hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on the edge of  the dell nearest to 
line 15407=>the  hill.  Behind  them  Sam  came upon  a  small store of  firewood neatly 
line 15408=>stacked. 
line 15409=>     'I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,' he said to Pippin. 'Whoever it 
line 15410=>was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.' 
line 15411=>     Strider  was greatly interested in  these discoveries.  'I  wish I  had 
line 15412=>waited and explored the  ground  down here myself,' he said, hurrying off to  
line 15413=>
line 15414=>####-the spring to examine the footprints.  
line 15415=>     'It is just as I feared,' he said, when he came back.  'Sam  and Pippin 
line 15416=>have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt or confused. Rangers 
line 15417=>have been  here lately. It  is  they who left the firewood behind. But there 
line 15418=>are also  several newer tracks  that were not made by Rangers. At least  one  
line 15419=>set was made, only a day or two ago, by  heavy boots. At least one. I cannot  
line 15420=>now be certain, but  I think  there were many booted feet.'  He  paused  and 
line 15421=>stood in anxious thought. 
line 15422=>     Each of the hobbits  saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted 
line 15423=>Riders. If the horsemen had already  found  the dell, the sooner Strider led 
line 15424=>them  somewhere else  the better. Sam viewed  the hollow with great dislike, 
line 15425=>now that he had heard news of their  enemies on the  Road, only a few  miles 
line 15426=>away. 
line 15427=>     'Hadn't we better clear out quick, Mr.  Strider?' he asked impatiently. 
line 15428=>'It  is get ting late,  and  I  don't like this  hole: it makes my heart sink  
line 15429=>somehow.' 
line 15430=>     'Yes,  we certainly must decide what to do  at once,' answered Strider, 
line 15431=>looking up and considering the time and the weather. 'Well, Sam,' he said at 
line 15432=>last,  'I do not  like  th is  place either; but  I  cannot think of anywhere 
line 15433=>better  that we could  reach before nightfall.  At least we are out of sight 
line 15434=>for the  moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by 
line 15435=>spies.  All we could  do would be to go right out  of our way back north  on 
line 15436=>this side of the line of hills, where the land is all much the same as it is 
line 15437=>here. The  Road  is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried  to 
line 15438=>take cover  in the thickets away to the south. On the north side of the Road 
line 15439=>beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles.' 
line 15440=>     'Can the Riders see?' asked Merry. 'I mean, they seem  usually  to have 
line 15441=>used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the 
line 15442=>right word, at least in the daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you  
line 15443=>saw them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.' 
line 15444=>     'I was too careless  on the  hill-top,' answered  Strider. 'I  was very 
line 15445=>anxious to  find some  sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake for three of us 
line 15446=>to go up and  stand  there  so long.  For the black horses  can see, and the 
line 15447=>Riders can use men and other creatures as  spies, as we found at Bree.  They 
line 15448=>themselves  do not see the  world of light as we  do,  but our  shapes  cast  
line 15449=>shadows in  their  minds, which only the  noon sun destroys; and in the dark 
line 15450=>they perceive many  signs and forms that are hidden from us:  then they  are 
line 15451=>
line 15452=>####-most to be feared. And at all times  they smell the blood  of living things,  
line 15453=>desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there are other  than sight or smell. We 
line 15454=>can feel their  presence - it troubled our hearts, as  soon as we came here, 
line 15455=>and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,' he added, and his 
line 15456=>voice sank to a whisper, 'the Ring draws them.' 
line 15457=>     'Is there no escape then?' said Frodo, looking round wildly. 'If I move 
line 15458=>I shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them to me!' 
line 15459=>     Strider laid  his hand on his shoulder. 'There is still hope,' he said. 
line 15460=>'You are not alone. Let us take  this wood that is set ready for the fire as 
line 15461=>a sign. There  is little  shelter or defence here,  but fire shall serve for  
line 15462=>both. Sauron can put fire to his evil uses, as he can  all things, but these 
line 15463=>Riders do  not love it, and  fear those who wield  it. Fire is our friend in 
line 15464=>the wilderness. ' 
line 15465=>     'Maybe,'  muttered Sam.  'It  is also as good a way of saying "here  we 
line 15466=>are" as I can think of, bar shouting.' 
line 15467=>     Down in  the  lowest and most  sheltered corner of the dell  they lit a  
line 15468=>fire, and prepared a meal. The shades of  evening began to fall, and it grew 
line 15469=>cold.  They  were  suddenly  aware of great  hunger,  for they had not eaten 
line 15470=>anything since breakfast; but they dared not make more than a frugal supper.  
line 15471=>The  lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly  places 
line 15472=>deserted by all the races of the  world. Rangers passed  at times beyond the 
line 15473=>hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of 
line 15474=>evil sort: trolls might stray down at times  out of  the northern valleys of 
line 15475=>the Misty Mountains. Only on the Road  would travellers be found, most often 
line 15476=>dwarves, hurrying along on business of their  own, and with no help  and few 
line 15477=>words to spare for strangers. 
line 15478=>     'I don't see how our food can be  made  to  last,' said Frodo. 'We have 
line 15479=>been careful  enough in the  last few days, and  this supper is no feast; but 
line 15480=>we have used  more than we ought,  if  we  have two weeks  still to go,  and 
line 15481=>perhaps more.' 
line 15482=>     'There is food in the wild,' said Strider; 'berry,  root, and herb; and 
line 15483=>I have  some skill as  a  hunter at need. You need not be afraid of starving  
line 15484=>before winter comes. But gathering and catching food is long and weary work, 
line 15485=>and  we need haste. So tighten your belts, and think with hope of the tables 
line 15486=>of Elrond's house!' 
line 15487=>     The  cold increased as darkness came  on. Peering out from the  edge of 
line 15488=>the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now  vanishing  quickly into 
line 15489=>
line 15490=>####-shadow. The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling 
line 15491=>stars. Frodo and  his companions  huddled  round the fire, wrapped   in every 
line 15492=>garment and  blanket they possessed;  but Strider was  content with a single 
line 15493=>cloak, and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe. 
line 15494=>     As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out  brightly he 
line 15495=>began to  tell  them  tales  to keep their minds  from  fear. He  knew  many 
line 15496=>histories and legends  of long ago,  of Elves  and Men and the good and evil  
line 15497=>deeds of the Elder Days. They  wondered how  old he was,  and  where he  had 
line 15498=>learned all this lore. 
line 15499=>     'Tell us of Gil-galad,' said Merry suddenly, when he paused  at the end  
line 15500=>of a story of the Elf-Kingdoms. 'Do you  know any more  of that old lay that 
line 15501=>you spoke of?' 
line 15502=>     'I do indeed,' answered Strider. 'So also does Frodo,  for  it concerns 
line 15503=>us closely.' Merry  and Pippin looked at Frodo,  who  was  staring  into the 
line 15504=>fire. 
line 15505=>     'I know  only the little that Gandalf has  told me,' said Frodo slowly. 
line 15506=>'Gil-galad was the last of the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth. Gil-galad is 
line 15507=>Starlight in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elf-friend, he went to the land 
line 15508=>of------' 
line 15509=>     'No!' said Strider  interrupting, 'I do not think that tale  should  be 
line 15510=>told now with  the servants of the Enemy  at hand. If we  win through to the  
line 15511=>house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.' 
line 15512=>     'Then  tell  u s  some other tale of  the old days,' begged Sam; 'a tale 
line 15513=>about  the Elves before the  fading time.  I would dearly  like to hear more 
line 15514=>about Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.' 
line 15515=>     'I will tell you the tale of Tin®viel,' said  Strider,  'in br ief - for 
line 15516=>it  is a long tale  of which the end is  not known; and  there are none now, 
line 15517=>except  Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old.  It is a fair 
line 15518=>tale, though it is sad, as are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet it may 
line 15519=>lift up your hearts.' He was silent for some  time, and then he began not to 
line 15520=>speak but to chant softly: 
line 15521=>     The leaves were long, the grass was green, 
line 15522=>     The hemlock-umbels tall and fair, 
line 15523=>     And in the glade a light was seen 
line 15524=>     Of stars in shadow shimmering. 
line 15525=>     Tin®viel was dancing there 
line 15526=>     To music of a pipe unseen, 
line 15527=>
line 15528=>####-     And light of stars was in her hair, 
line 15529=>     And in her raiment glimmering. 
line 15530=> 
line 15531=>     There Beren came from mountains cold, 
line 15532=>     And lost he wandered under leaves, 
line 15533=>     And where the Elven-river rolled 
line 15534=>     He walked alone and sorrowing. 
line 15535=>     He peered between the hemlock-leaves 
line 15536=>     And saw in wander flowers of gold  
line 15537=>     Upon her mantle and her sleeves, 
line 15538=>     And her hair like shadow following. 
line 15539=> 
line 15540=>     Enchantment healed his weary feet 
line 15541=>     That over hills were doomed to roam; 
line 15542=>     And forth he hastened, strong and fleet, 
line 15543=>     And grasped at moonbeams glistening. 
line 15544=>     Through woven woods in Elvenhome 
line 15545=>     She tightly fled on dancing feet, 
line 15546=>     And left him lonely still to roam 
line 15547=>     In the silent forest listening. 
line 15548=> 
line 15549=>     He heard there oft the flying sound 
line 15550=>     Of feet as light as linden-leaves, 
line 15551=>     Or music welling underground, 
line 15552=>     In hidden hollows quavering. 
line 15553=>     Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves, 
line 15554=>     And one by one with sighing sound  
line 15555=>     Whispering fell the beechen leaves 
line 15556=>     In the wintry woodland wavering. 
line 15557=> 
line 15558=>     He sought her ever, wandering far 
line 15559=>     Where leaves of years were thickly strewn, 
line 15560=>     By light of moon and ray of star 
line 15561=>     In frosty heavens shivering. 
line 15562=>     Her mantle glinted in the moon, 
line 15563=>     As on a hill-top high and far 
line 15564=>     She danced, and at her feet was strewn  
line 15565=>
line 15566=>####-     A mist of silver quivering. 
line 15567=> 
line 15568=>     When winter passed, she came again, 
line 15569=>     And her song released the sudden spring, 
line 15570=>     Like rising lark, and falling rain, 
line 15571=>     And melting water bubbling. 
line 15572=>     He saw the elven-flowers spring 
line 15573=>     About her feet, and healed again  
line 15574=>     He longed by her to dance and sing 
line 15575=>     Upon the grass untroubling. 
line 15576=> 
line 15577=>     Again she fled, but swift he came. 
line 15578=>     Tin®viel! Tin®viel! 
line 15579=>     He called her by her elvish name; 
line 15580=>     And there she halted listening. 
line 15581=>     One moment stood she, and a spell 
line 15582=>     His voice laid on her: Beren came, 
line 15583=>     And doom fell on Tin®viel 
line 15584=>     That in his arms lay glistening. 
line 15585=> 
line 15586=>     As Beren looked into her eyes 
line 15587=>     Within the shadows of her hair, 
line 15588=>     The trembling starlight of the skies 
line 15589=>     He saw there mirrored shimmering. 
line 15590=>     Tin®viel the elven-fair, 
line 15591=>     Immortal maiden elven-wise, 
line 15592=>     About him cast her shadowy hair 
line 15593=>     And arms like silver glimmering. 
line 15594=> 
line 15595=>     Long was the way that fate them bore, 
line 15596=>     O'er stony mountains cold and grey, 
line 15597=>     Through halls of iron and darkling door, 
line 15598=>     And woods of nightshade morrowless. 
line 15599=>     The Sundering Seas between them lay, 
line 15600=>     And yet at last they met once more, 
line 15601=>     And long ago they passed away 
line 15602=>     In the forest singing sorrowless. 
line 15603=>
line 15604=>####-     Strider sighed and paused before he spoke again.  'That is a song,'  he 
line 15605=>said, 'in the mode that  is called ann-thennath  among the Elves, but is hard 
line 15606=>to render in our Common Speech, and this is  but a rough echo of it. It tells 
line 15607=>of the meeting of Beren son  of  Barahir and  L®thien Tin®viel. Beren was  a 
line 15608=>mortal man,  but L®thien was the daughter of Thingol,  a King  of Elves upon 
line 15609=>Middle-earth when the world was young; and  she was the fairest  maiden that 
line 15610=>has ever been among all  the children of this world. As  the stars above the 
line 15611=>mists  of  the Northern  lands was her loveliness,  and  in her  face  was a  
line 15612=>shining light. In those days  the Great Enemy, of  whom Sauron of Mordor was 
line 15613=>but a servant, dwelt  in Angband  in the North,  and the  Elves of the  West 
line 15614=>coming back to Middle-earth made  war upon him to regain the Silmarils which 
line 15615=>he had  stolen; and  the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the  Enemy  was 
line 15616=>victorious  and Barahir  was slain,  and Beren escaping through great  peril 
line 15617=>came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in  the 
line 15618=>forest of Neldoreth.  There he beheld L®thien singing and dancing in a glade 
line 15619=>beside the enchanted  river Esgalduin; and  he named  her Tin®viel,  that is 
line 15620=>Nightingale in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and 
line 15621=>they  were parted long. Tin®viel rescued Beren from  the dungeons of Sauron, 
line 15622=>and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great 
line 15623=>Enemy  from  his  throne, and took  from  his  iron  crown one of the  three 
line 15624=>Silmarils, brightest of  all jewels, to  be  the  bride-price of L®thien  to 
line 15625=>Thingol her father. Yet  at the last  Beren  was slain by the Wolf that came 
line 15626=>from  the gates  of  Angband, and he died in  the arms of Tin®viel.  But she 
line 15627=>chose mortality, and to die from  the world,  so that  she might follow him; 
line 15628=>and it  is sung that they met again beyond the Sundering  Seas, and  after a  
line 15629=>brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, 
line 15630=>long ago, beyond the confines of this  world. So it is that L®thien Tin®viel 
line 15631=>alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left  the  world, and they have 
line 15632=>lost her  whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of 
line 15633=>old descended among  Men.  There live  still those of whom  L®thien  was the 
line 15634=>foremother,  and  it  is  said  that  her line shall  never fail.  Elrond of 
line 15635=>Rivendell is of that Kin. For of  Beren and L®thien  was born Dior Thingol's 
line 15636=>heir;  and of him Elwing  the White whom Edrendil wedded, he that sailed his 
line 15637=>ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril 
line 15638=>upon  his brow.  And  of  Edrendil  came  the  Kings  of  N®menor,  that  is 
line 15639=>Westernesse.' 
line 15640=>     As Strider was speaking  they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit 
line 15641=>
line 15642=>####-in the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes shone, and his voice was rich and 
line 15643=>deep. Above him was a black starry  sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over  
line 15644=>the crown  of Weathertop behind  him. The  waxing  moon  was climbing 
line 15645=>slowly 
line 15646=>above  the  hill that  overshadowed  them, and the  stars above the hill-top 
line 15647=>faded. 
line 15648=>     The  story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. 'Look!' said  Merry. 
line 15649=>'The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.' 
line 15650=>     The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the  top of  the 
line 15651=>hill something small and dark  against  the  glimmer of the moonrise. It was 
line 15652=>perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light. 
line 15653=>     Sam  and Merry  got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo  and Pippin 
line 15654=>remained seated in silence.  Strider was watching the moonlight on  the hill 
line 15655=>intently.  All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt  a cold dread creeping 
line 15656=>over his heart,  now that Strider was  no longer speaking. He huddled closer  
line 15657=>to the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell. 
line 15658=>     'I don't  know what it is,'  he  said, 'but  I suddenly felt afraid.  I 
line 15659=>durstn't  go  outside this dell  for any money;  I felt that  something  was 
line 15660=>creeping up the slope.' 
line 15661=>     'Did you see anything?' asked Frodo, springing to his feet. 
line 15662=>     'No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn't stop to look.' 
line 15663=>     'I  saw something,' said Merry; 'or  I thought  I did  -  away westwards 
line 15664=>where  the moonlight was  falling  on  the  flats  beyond the  shadow of the 
line 15665=>hill-tops, I thought there were two or three black shapes. They seemed to be 
line 15666=>moving this way.' 
line 15667=>     'Keep close to the  fire, with your faces outward!' cried Strider. 'Get 
line 15668=>some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!' 
line 15669=>     For a breathless  time  they sat there, silent  and  alert, with  their 
line 15670=>backs  turned to the  wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled 
line 15671=>them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or  movement in the night.  
line 15672=>Frodo 
line 15673=>stirred,  feeling that he must break the silence:  he longed  to  shout  out 
line 15674=>aloud. 
line 15675=>     'Hush!' whispered Strider.  'What's  that?' gasped Pippin at  the  same 
line 15676=>moment. 
line 15677=>     Over the  lip of the little dell, on the side away  from the hill, they 
line 15678=>felt, rather  than saw, a shadow  rise,  one  shadow or  more than one. They 
line 15679=>
line 15680=>####-strained their eyes, and the shadows  seemed to grow. Soon there could be no 
line 15681=>doubt: 
line 15682=>     three or four  tall black  figures  were standing  there  on the slope, 
line 15683=>looking down  on  them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes 
line 15684=>in the deep shade behind them. Frodo  thought that he heard  a faint hiss as 
line 15685=>of venomous breath  and felt a thin  piercing chill. Then the  shapes slowly 
line 15686=>advanced. 
line 15687=>     Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the 
line 15688=>ground. Sam shrank to Frodo's side. Frodo was hardly less terrified than his 
line 15689=>companions; he  was quaking  as  if he was bitter cold,  but his  terror was 
line 15690=>swallowed  up in  a sudden temptation  to put on the Ring. The  desire to do  
line 15691=>this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. He did not forget 
line 15692=>the Barrow,  nor  the  message  of  Gandalf;  but  something  seemed  to  be 
line 15693=>compelling  him to disregard  all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not with  
line 15694=>the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt 
line 15695=>that he must take the Ring and put  it on his finger. He could not speak. He 
line 15696=>felt Sam looking at him, as if  he knew  that  his  master was in some great 
line 15697=>trouble, but  he could not turn  towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled 
line 15698=>for a while; but  resistance became unbearable, and at  last he  slowly drew 
line 15699=>out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand. 
line 15700=>     Immediately, though everything  else remained as before,  dim and dark, 
line 15701=>the shapes became  terribly clear. He was able to  see beneath  their  black  
line 15702=>wrappings. There were  five  tall  figures: two standing on the lip  of  the 
line 15703=>dell, three advancing. In their white faces burned  keen and merciless eyes;  
line 15704=>under their mantles were long grey robes;  upon  their grey hairs were helms 
line 15705=>of silver; in their haggard hands  were  swords of steel. Their eyes fell on 
line 15706=>him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate, he  drew his own 
line 15707=>sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. 
line 15708=>Two of the figures  halted. The   third was taller than  the others: his hair 
line 15709=>was long and gleaming and  on his  helm was  a crown.  In one hand he held a  
line 15710=>long sword, and in the other a knife;  both the knife and the hand that held 
line 15711=>it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo. 
line 15712=>     At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on  the ground, and he heard 
line 15713=>himself crying aloud: O  Elbereth! Gilthoniel! At the same time he struck at 
line 15714=>the feet of his enemy. A shrill  cry rang  out in the night;  and he felt  a  
line 15715=>pain  like  a  dart  of  poisoned ice  pierce his left shoulder. Even  as he 
line 15716=>swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist,  a glimpse of Strider leaping 
line 15717=>
line 15718=>####-out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last  
line 15719=>effort Frodo,  dropping  his sword, slipped  the Ring from  his  finger  and 
line 15720=>closed his right hand tight upon it. 
line 15721=> 
line 15722=>
line 15723=>####- 
line 15724=>
line 15725=>Chapter 12. Flight to the Ford 
line 15726=>
line 15727=> 
line 15728=> 
line 15729=>     When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately.  
line 15730=>He was lying by the fire, which was now piled high and burning br ightly. His 
line 15731=>three companions were bending  over  him.  'What has happened? Where is  the 
line 15732=>pale  king?' he  asked wildly. They were too overjoyed to  hear him speak to  
line 15733=>answer  for  a  while; nor did they  understand  his question.  At length he 
line 15734=>gathered from  Sam that they had seen nothing  but the vague shadowy  shapes 
line 15735=>coming towards them.  Suddenly to his  horror Sam found  that his master had 
line 15736=>vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He 
line 15737=>heard  Frodo's  voice, but it seemed to  come from a great distance, or from 
line 15738=>under the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they  
line 15739=>stumbled over the body of Frodo, lying as  if  dead,  face downwards  on the 
line 15740=>grass  with his sword  beneath  him. Strider ordered them to pick him up and 
line 15741=>lay  him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now  a  good while 
line 15742=>ago. 
line 15743=>     Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while  
line 15744=>they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly out  of the  shadows. They 
line 15745=>started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down 
line 15746=>swiftly at his side. 
line 15747=>     'I  am not a Black  Rider,  Sam,' he said  gently, 'nor in league  with 
line 15748=>them. I  have been  trying to discover  something of  their movements; but I 
line 15749=>have  found nothing. I cannot  think  why  they have gone and do  not attack  
line 15750=>again. But there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.' 
line 15751=>     When he heard what Frodo had  to tell, he became full  of concern,  and 
line 15752=>shook his head  and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much 
line 15753=>water as they could in their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with  it. 
line 15754=>'Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!' he said. Then he got up and 
line 15755=>walked  away, and called  Sam to him.  'I think I  understand  things better 
line 15756=>now,' he said in  a low voice.  'There  seem only to  have  been five of the 
line 15757=>enemy. Why they were not all here,  I  don't know;  but I  don't  think they 
line 15758=>expected to  be resisted.  They have drawn off for the  time being. But  not 
line 15759=>far,  I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape.  They 
line 15760=>are  only  waiting,  because  they  think  that   their  purpose  is  almost  
line 15761=>accomplished, and that the  Ring  cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that 
line 15762=>
line 15763=>####-they believe  your  master has a deadly  wound that will subdue him to their  
line 15764=>will. We  shall see!' Sam choked with tears. 'Don't  despair!' said Strider. 
line 15765=>'You  must trust  me  now. Your  Frodo is made of sterner  stuff  than I had 
line 15766=>guessed, though Gandalf  hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and 
line 15767=>I think he will  resist the evil power of the wound longer  than his enemies 
line 15768=>expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am 
line 15769=>away!' He hurried off and disappeared again into the darkness. 
line 15770=>     Frodo  dozed, though the  pain  of his wound was slowly growing,  and a  
line 15771=>deadly  chill  was spreading  from  his  shoulder to  his arm  and side. His 
line 15772=>friends watched  over him, warming him,  and bathing  his  wound.  The night 
line 15773=>passed  slowly  and wearily.  Dawn was growing in the sky, and the  dell was 
line 15774=>filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned. 
line 15775=>     'Look!' he cried; and stooping he lifted from the  ground a black cloak 
line 15776=>that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there 
line 15777=>was a slash. 'This was  the stroke of Frodo's sword,' he said. 'The only hurt 
line 15778=>that it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but  all blades perish 
line 15779=>that pierce  that  dreadful  King.  More  deadly  to  him  was  the name  of 
line 15780=>Elbereth.' 
line 15781=>     'And  more  deadly to Frodo was this!' He stooped again and lifted up a  
line 15782=>long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw 
line 15783=>that near the end  its edge was notched and  the  point was broken  off. But 
line 15784=>even as he  held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for  
line 15785=>the blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only  
line 15786=>the hilt in  Strider's hand. 'Alas!' he  cried. 'It was this accursed  knife 
line 15787=>that gave the wound. Few now have the  skill in  healing to match  such evil  
line 15788=>weapons. But I will do what I can.' 
line 15789=>     He sat down on the  ground, and taking  the dagger -hilt laid it  on his 
line 15790=>knees, and he  sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it 
line 15791=>aside, he turned to Frodo  and in  a soft tone  spoke words the others could 
line 15792=>not catch.  From  the pouch at  his  belt he drew  out the  long leaves of a  
line 15793=>plant. 
line 15794=>     'These  leaves,' he said, 'I have  walked far to  find; for  this plant 
line 15795=>does not grow in the bare hills;  but in the thickets away south of the Road 
line 15796=>I found it in the  dark by the scent of its leaves.' He crushed a leaf in his 
line 15797=>fingers,  and it gave out  a  sweet and pungent fragrance. 'It  is fortunate 
line 15798=>that  I could find it, for it is  a healing plant that the  Men of  the West 
line 15799=>brought to Middle-earth. Athelas they  named it,  and it grows  now sparsely 
line 15800=>
line 15801=>####-and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old;  and it is not known 
line 15802=>in the  North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It  has great 
line 15803=>virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.' 
line 15804=>     He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo's shoulder. The 
line 15805=>fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their 
line 15806=>minds calmed and cleared. The herb had  also some  power over the wound, for  
line 15807=>Frodo felt the pain   and also the  sense of  frozen cold lessen in his side; 
line 15808=>but the life did not return to his arm, and  he could not  raise or  use his 
line 15809=>hand.  He  bitterly  regretted his  foolishness, and reproached himself  for  
line 15810=>weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed 
line 15811=>not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he 
line 15812=>would  remain maimed for  life,  and how they would now  manage to  continue 
line 15813=>their journey. He fell too weak to stand. 
line 15814=>     The others were discussing this very question. They  quickly decided to 
line 15815=>leave Weathertop as soon as possible. 'I think now,' said Strider, 'that the 
line 15816=>enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, 
line 15817=>then he  must have been forced to ride away, and  he will not return. In any 
line 15818=>case we are in great peril here after  dark, since the attack of last night, 
line 15819=>and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.' 
line 15820=>     As  soon  as  the  daylight  was  full, they had some hurried food  and 
line 15821=>packed. It was impossible for Frodo  to  walk, so  they divided the  greater  
line 15822=>part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo  on the pony. In 
line 15823=>the last few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed 
line 15824=>fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an a ffection for its new masters, 
line 15825=>especially for Sam. Bill Ferny's treatment must  have been very hard for the 
line 15826=>journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former life. 
line 15827=>     They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the 
line 15828=>Road,  but. it was the  quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed 
line 15829=>fuel; for Strider said  that Frodo must be kept warm,  especially at  night, 
line 15830=>while fire would be some protection  for them all. It  was also his  plan to 
line 15831=>shorten their journey by cutting  across another great loop of the Road: east  
line 15832=>beyond Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards. 
line 15833=>     They made  their  way slowly  and  cautiously  round the  south-western 
line 15834=>slopes  of the  hill, and came in a  little while to the  edge of the  Road. 
line 15835=>There was no sign of the Riders. But  even as they were hurrying across they 
line 15836=>heard far away two  cries: a cold voice calling and  a cold voice answering. 
line 15837=>Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The 
line 15838=>
line 15839=>####-land before them  sloped  away  southwards, but  it was  wild  and pathless; 
line 15840=>bushes and  stunted trees  grew in dense patches with wide barren  spaces in 
line 15841=>between.  The grass was scanty, coarse,  and grey;  and  the leaves  in  the 
line 15842=>thickets were faded and falling. It was  a cheerless land, and their journey 
line 15843=>was slow and gloomy. They spoke  little as they trudged along. Frodo's heart 
line 15844=>was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down, 
line 15845=>and 
line 15846=>their  backs bowed  under  their  burdens.  Even  Strider  seemed  tired and 
line 15847=>heavy-hearted. 
line 15848=>     Before the first day's march was over Frodo's pain began to grow again, 
line 15849=>but he did not speak of it for  a long time. Four  days passed,  without the 
line 15850=>ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop 
line 15851=>slowly 
line 15852=>sank,  and  before  them the distant mountains loomed a  little nearer.  Yet 
line 15853=>since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked 
line 15854=>their  flight or followed them.  They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch 
line 15855=>in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see black shapes stalking in the 
line 15856=>grey night, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled  moon; but they  saw nothing,  and 
line 15857=>heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once  did they 
line 15858=>feel the sense of present  evil that  had assailed them before the attack in 
line 15859=>the dell. It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already  lost their 
line 15860=>trail again. Perhaps  they  were waiting  to  make  some ambush in  a narrow 
line 15861=>place? 
line 15862=>     At the end of  the fifth day the ground began once more  to rise slowly 
line 15863=>out of the wide  shallow valley into which  they had  descended. Strider now  
line 15864=>turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached 
line 15865=>the top of a long slow-climbing slope, and saw far  ahead a huddle of wooded 
line 15866=>hills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round  the  feet  of 
line 15867=>the hills;  and  to  their  right  a  grey river  gleamed  pale in the  thin 
line 15868=>sunshine. In the  distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley 
line 15869=>half-veiled in mist. 
line 15870=>     "I am  afraid we must  go back  to  the Road  here for  a while,'  said 
line 15871=>Strider.  'We have  now  come to  the  River Hoarwell,  that the Elves  call 
line 15872=>Mitheithel. It  flows down out  of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells  north of 
line 15873=>Rivendell,  and joins  the Loudwater away in the  South.  Some  call  it the 
line 15874=>Greyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the  Sea. There is 
line 15875=>no way over  it  below  its sources  in the Ettenmoors, except by  the  Last  
line 15876=>
line 15877=>####-Bridge on which the Road crosses.' 
line 15878=>     'What is that other river we can see far away there?' asked Merry. 
line 15879=>     'That is Loudwater,  the Bruinen of Rivendell,'  answered Strider. 'The 
line 15880=>Road runs along the edge of  the hills for many miles from the Bridge to the 
line 15881=>Ford of Bruinen. But I have  not yet thought how  we shall cross that water. 
line 15882=>One river at a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last  
line 15883=>Bridge held against us.' 
line 15884=>     Next day, early in  the morning, they came down again to the borders of 
line 15885=>the Road.  Sam  and  Strider  went  forward, but they found no  sign of  any 
line 15886=>travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some 
line 15887=>rain. Strider judged that it had fallen two days before, and had washed away 
line 15888=>all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see. 
line 15889=>     They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile 
line 15890=>or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom of a short steep slope. 
line 15891=>They dreaded  to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider 
line 15892=>made them take cover  in a  thicket at  the side of the Road, while  he went 
line 15893=>forward to explore. 
line 15894=>     Before long he came hurrying back. 'I can see no sign of the enemy,' he 
line 15895=>said,  'and I wonder very much what that  means. But  I have found something 
line 15896=>very strange.' 
line 15897=>     He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. 'I found it 
line 15898=>in  the  mud in  the  middle of the  Bridge,' he said. 'It  is  a beryl,  an 
line 15899=>elf-stone.  Whether it was set  there, or  let fall by chance, I cannot say; 
line 15900=>but  it brings  hope to  me. I will take it as a sign that we may  pass  the 
line 15901=>Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep  to  the Road, without some  clearer  
line 15902=>token.' 
line 15903=>     At once they went on again. They crossed  the Bridge in safety, hearing 
line 15904=>no sound  but  the water  swirling  against its three great  arches. A  mile 
line 15905=>further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the 
line 15906=>steep  lands  on  the left of the Road.  Here Strider turned aside, and soon 
line 15907=>they were lost in a sombre  country of dark trees winding among the feet  of 
line 15908=>sullen hills. 
line 15909=>     The hobbits were glad  to leave  the  cheerless lands and the  perilous 
line 15910=>Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly. As 
line 15911=>they went forward the hills about them steadily rose. Here  and  there  upon 
line 15912=>heights  and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls  of stone, and the 
line 15913=>ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo,  who was  not walking, had 
line 15914=>
line 15915=>####-time to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled Bilbo's account of his  journey 
line 15916=>and the  threatening towers on  the hills north of  the Road, in the country 
line 15917=>near the Troll's wood where his first serious adventure had  happened. Frodo 
line 15918=>guessed that they were  now in the  same  region, and wondered if by  chance 
line 15919=>they would pass near the spot. 
line 15920=>     'Who lives  in this land?'  he asked.  'And  who built these  towers? Is 
line 15921=>this troll-country?' 
line 15922=>     'No!' said Strider. 'Trolls do  not  build. No one lives in  this land. 
line 15923=>Men once dwelt  here, ages ago;  but  none remain  now. They  became an evil 
line 15924=>people, as legends  tell, for they fell under  the shadow of Angmar. But all 
line 15925=>were destroyed  in the war that  brought the North Kingdom to  its  end. But 
line 15926=>that is now so long ago that the hills  have forgotten them, though a shadow  
line 15927=>still lies on the land.' 
line 15928=>     'Where  did you learn  such  tales,  if  all  the  land  is  empty  and 
line 15929=>forgetful?' asked Peregrin. 'The  birds and beasts do not tell tales of that 
line 15930=>son.' 
line 15931=>     'The  heirs  of Elendil do not forget all  things past,'  said Strider; 
line 15932=>'and  many more things than  I can tell are remembered in  Rivendell.'  'Have  
line 15933=>you often  been to Rivendell?' said  Frodo. 'I have,' said Strider. 'I dwelt 
line 15934=>there once, and still I return when I may. 
line 15935=>     There my heart is;  but  it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the 
line 15936=>fair house of Elrond.' 
line 15937=>     The hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on its way to  
line 15938=>the River Bruinen, but both were  now hidden  from view. The travellers came 
line 15939=>into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark  and silent.  Trees with old 
line 15940=>and twisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes 
line 15941=>of pine-wood. 
line 15942=>     The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick 
line 15943=>their way through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled 
line 15944=>rocks. As long as they could they avoided  climbing  for  Frodo's  sake, and 
line 15945=>because it was in fact difficult to find any way up out of the narrow dales.  
line 15946=>They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. The wind 
line 15947=>began  to blow steadily  out  of  the West and pour the water of the distant 
line 15948=>seas  on the  dark  heads of the hills in fine  drenching rain. By nightfall 
line 15949=>they  were all soaked,  and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get 
line 15950=>any  fire  to burn. The next  day the  hills rose still  higher  and steeper  
line 15951=>before  them, and  they were forced to  turn away  northwards out  of  their 
line 15952=>
line 15953=>####-course. Strider seemed to  be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out 
line 15954=>from Weathertop, and their stock of  provisions was beginning to run low. It  
line 15955=>went on raining. 
line 15956=>     That night they camped on  a stony shelf with a rock -wall  behind them, 
line 15957=>in which  there was a shallow cave,  a  mere scoop in the  cliff.  Frodo was 
line 15958=>restless. The  cold and wet had  made his wound more painful  than ever, and 
line 15959=>the ache and sense of deadly chill took  away all sleep.  He lay tossing and 
line 15960=>turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks 
line 15961=>of  rock, water  dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling  fall of  a loosened 
line 15962=>stone. He felt that black shapes  were advancing to smother him; but when he 
line 15963=>sat up he saw  nothing but  the back of  Strider  sitting hunched up, smoking 
line 15964=>his pipe, and watching.  He lay down again and passed into an uneasy  dream, 
line 15965=>in  which he  walked on the grass in his garden in the Shire,  but it seemed 
line 15966=>faint  and dim, less clear  than the  tall black shadows that  stood looking 
line 15967=>over the hedge. 
line 15968=>     In  the morning he  woke to  find that the rain had stopped. The clouds 
line 15969=>were still thick,  but they were breaking, and pale strips of  blue appeared 
line 15970=>between them.  The  wind was  shifting  again.  They  did  not start  early.  
line 15971=>Immediately after  their cold  and  comfortless  breakfast Strider  went off 
line 15972=>alone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he 
line 15973=>came  back. He was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie 
line 15974=>of the land. 
line 15975=>     When  he returned he was not reassuring.  'We have come too  far to the 
line 15976=>north,' he said, 'and we must find  some way to  turn back southwards again.  
line 15977=>If we  keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north 
line 15978=>of  Rivendell.  That is  troll -country,  and  little known  to  me. We could 
line 15979=>perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but 
line 15980=>it would take  too long,  for I  do not know the way, and our food would not  
line 15981=>last. So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen.' 
line 15982=>     The  rest of that day they  spent  scrambling over  rocky  ground. They 
line 15983=>found  a passage between  two  hills that  led them into  a  valley  running 
line 15984=>south-east, the  direction that they wished  to take; but towards the end of 
line 15985=>the day they found their road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark 
line 15986=>edge  against  the  sky was  broken  into many bare points like teeth  of  a  
line 15987=>blunted saw. They had a choice between going back or climbing over it. 
line 15988=>     They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before 
line 15989=>long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot. Even so  they 
line 15990=>
line 15991=>####-often  despaired of  getting their pony up, or  indeed of finding a path for  
line 15992=>themselves, burdened as  they were. The light was nearly gone, and they were 
line 15993=>all exhausted, when at last they reached the top. They  had climbed on to  a  
line 15994=>narrow  saddle  between two  higher points, and the  land fell  steeply away 
line 15995=>again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the 
line 15996=>ground shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder  felt 
line 15997=>as if icy claws were  laid upon them.  The trees  and rocks about him seemed 
line 15998=>shadowy and dim. 
line 15999=>     'We  cannot go any further,' said  Merry to Strider. 'I am  afraid this 
line 16000=>has been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully  anxious about him. What are we 
line 16001=>to do? Do you think they  will be able to cure him in Rivendell,  if we ever 
line 16002=>get there?' 
line 16003=>     'We shall see,'  answered Strider. 'There is nothing more that I can do 
line 16004=>in  the  wilderness;  and  it is chiefly because of  his wound that I am  so 
line 16005=>anxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further tonight.' 
line 16006=>     'What is the matter with my  master?' asked Sam in a low voice, looking 
line 16007=>appealingly  at Strider.  'His  wound was small, and it is  already  closed. 
line 16008=>There's nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.' 
line 16009=>     'Frodo  has been  touched  by the weapons of  the Enemy,' said Strider, 
line 16010=>'and there is some poison  or evil at work that is beyond my  skill to drive 
line 16011=>out. But do not give up hope, Sam!' 
line 16012=>     Night was cold up on the  high ridge. They lit a small fire  down under 
line 16013=>the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as 
line 16014=>if stone had once been  quarried there. They sat  huddled together. The wind 
line 16015=>blew chill through the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning 
line 16016=>and  sighing.  Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark  wings 
line 16017=>were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that  sought 
line 16018=>him in all the hollows of the hills.  
line 16019=>     The  morning dawned bright  and fair; the air  was clean, and the light 
line 16020=>pale and clear  in a rain-washed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, but (hey 
line 16021=>longed for the  sun to warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as it was light, 
line 16022=>Strider took Merry  with him and went to survey the country from  the height 
line 16023=>to the east of the pass. The sun had risen and was shining  brightly when he 
line 16024=>returned  with more comforting news. They were now going more or less in the 
line 16025=>right direction. If they went on, down the  further side of the ridge,  they 
line 16026=>would have the Mountains on their left. Some way  ahead Strider had caught a  
line 16027=>glimpse  of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from 
line 16028=>
line 16029=>####-view, the Road to the  Ford was not far from the River  and  lay on the side 
line 16030=>nearest to them. 
line 16031=>     'We must make for  the  Road again,' he said. 'We cannot hope to find a  
line 16032=>path through these hills. Whatever danger may beset it, the Road is our only 
line 16033=>way to the Ford.' 
line 16034=>     As soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed  slowly down 
line 16035=>the southern side  of the ridge; but the way  was much easier  than they had 
line 16036=>expected, for the slope  was  far less steep on  this side, and before  long 
line 16037=>Frodo was able  to  ride again. Bill Ferny's poor old pony was developing an 
line 16038=>unexpected talent  for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many 
line 16039=>jolts as possible. The  spirits of the  party  rose  again. Even  Frodo felt 
line 16040=>better in  the  morning  light, but every  now  and again  a mist seemed  to 
line 16041=>obscure his sight, and he pa ssed his hands over his eyes.  
line 16042=>     Pippin was a little  ahead of the  others. Suddenly he turned round and 
line 16043=>called to them. 'There is a path here!' he cried. 
line 16044=>     When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake: 
line 16045=>     there were clearly  the beginnings of  a  path, that climbed  with many 
line 16046=>windings  out of  the woods  below and faded away on the hill-top behind. In 
line 16047=>places it was  now faint and overgrown,  or choked  with fallen  stones  and 
line 16048=>trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used.  It was a path made 
line 16049=>by strong arms  and heavy feet. Here and  there old trees  had  been cut  or  
line 16050=>broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way. 
line 16051=>     They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest  
line 16052=>way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came 
line 16053=>into the dark  woods, and the path grew plainer and broader. Suddenly coming 
line 16054=>out  of a belt of fir-trees  it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply 
line 16055=>to the left round the comer  of a rocky shoulder of the hill. When they came 
line 16056=>to the comer they  looked round and  saw  that the path ran on  over a level 
line 16057=>strip  under the face of a low  cliff overhung with trees. In the stony wall 
line 16058=>there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge. 
line 16059=>     Outside the door they all  halted. There was  a  cave  or  rock -chamber  
line 16060=>behind, but  in the gloom  inside nothing  could be  seen. Strider, Sam, and 
line 16061=>Merry  pushing with all  their  strength managed  to open  the door a little 
line 16062=>wider, and then Strider  and Merry  went in. They did not go far, for on the 
line 16063=>floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen  near the entrance 
line 16064=>except some great empty jars and broken pots. 
line 16065=>     'Surely  this  is a troll-hole, if ever there  was one!'  said  Pippin. 
line 16066=>
line 16067=>####-'Come out, you two, and let us get away. Now we know  who made the path  -
line 16068=>and 
line 16069=>we had better get off it quick.' 
line 16070=>     'There  is  no  need, I think,'  said  Strider,  coining  out.  'It  is 
line 16071=>certainly a troll-hole,  but it seems  to have  been  long forsaken. I don't 
line 16072=>think we need be afraid. But let us go on down warily, and we shall see.' 
line 16073=>     The  path  went on again from the door, and turning to the right  again 
line 16074=>across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope. Pippin, not liking 
line 16075=>to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead  with Merry. Sam and 
line 16076=>Strider came behind, one on each side of  Frodo's pony, for the path was now 
line 16077=>broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone 
line 16078=>very far  before Pippin came  running back,  fol lowed  by Merry.  They  both 
line 16079=>looked terrified. 
line 16080=>     'There are trolls!' Pippin panted. 'Down in a clearing in the woods not 
line 16081=>far below. We  got a sight of them  through  the tree-trunks.  They are very 
line 16082=>large!' 
line 16083=>     'We  will come and  look at them,' said  Strider,  picking  up a stick. 
line 16084=>Frodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared. 
line 16085=>     The  sun was now  high, and  it  shone  down through the  half-stripped 
line 16086=>branches of  the  trees, and lit the clearing with bright patches of  light. 
line 16087=>They halted  suddenly  on the  edge,  and  peered  through the  tree-trunks, 
line 16088=>holding their breath. There stood  the trolls: three large  trolls.  One was 
line 16089=>stooping, and the other two stood staring at him. 
line 16090=>     Strider walked forward unconcernedly. 'Get up, old stone!' he said, and 
line 16091=>brok e his stick upon the stooping troll. 
line 16092=>     Nothing happened. There  was a  gasp  of astonishment from the hobbits,  
line 16093=>and then even Frodo laughed. 'Well!' he said.  'We are forgetting our family 
line 16094=>history!  These  must  be the  very  three  that  were  caught  by  Gandalf,  
line 16095=>quarrelling over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.' 
line 16096=>     'I had no  idea we were  anywhere near the place!' said Pippin. He knew 
line 16097=>the  story well. Bilbo  and Frodo had told it often; but as a matter of fact 
line 16098=>he had  never mor e than half believed  it. Even now he  looked  at the stone 
line 16099=>trolls with suspicion, wondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them 
line 16100=>to life again. 
line 16101=>     'You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew 
line 16102=>about  trolls,' said Strider. 'It is broad daylight with  a bright sun,  and 
line 16103=>yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale  of live trolls waiting for  
line 16104=>
line 16105=>####-us in this glade! In any case you might have noticed that one of them has an 
line 16106=>old bird's nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament  for a  
line 16107=>live troll!' 
line 16108=>     They  all laughed.  Frodo felt  his spirits  reviving: the reminder  of 
line 16109=>Bilbo's  first successful adventure  was  heartening. The sun, too, was warm 
line 16110=>and comforting, and the mist before his  eyes seemed to be lifting a little. 
line 16111=>They rested for some time in the glade,  and took  their  mid-day meal right 
line 16112=>under the shadow of the trolls' large legs. 
line 16113=>     'Won't somebody give  us  a bit of a song, while the sun is high?' said 
line 16114=>Merry, when they had finished. 'We haven't ha d a song or a tale for days.' 
line 16115=>     'Not since  Weathertop,' said Frodo. The  others looked at him.  'Don't  
line 16116=>worry about me!' he added. 'I  feel much  better, but I  don't think I could 
line 16117=>sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory.' 
line 16118=>     'Come on,  Sam!' said Merry. 'There's more  stored in your head than you  
line 16119=>let on about.' 
line 16120=>     'I don't know about that,' said Sam. 'But how would this suit? It ain't  
line 16121=>what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense. But 
line 16122=>these old images here  brought it to my mind.' Standing  up,  with his hands 
line 16123=>behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune. 
line 16124=>     Troll sat alone on his seat of stone, 
line 16125=>     And munched and mumbled a bare old bone; 
line 16126=>     For many a year he had gnawed it near, 
line 16127=>     For meat was hard to come by. 
line 16128=>     Done by! Gum by! 
line 16129=>     In a case in the hills he dwelt alone, 
line 16130=>     And meat was hard to come by. 
line 16131=> 
line 16132=>     Up came Tom with his big boots on. 
line 16133=>     Said he to Troll: 'Pray, what is yon? 
line 16134=>     For it looks like the shin o' my nuncle Tim, 
line 16135=>     As should be a -lyin' in graveyard. 
line 16136=>     Caveyard! Paveyard! 
line 16137=>     This many a year has Tim been gone, 
line 16138=>     And I thought he were lyin' in graveyard.' 
line 16139=> 
line 16140=>     'My lad,' said Troll, 'this bone I stole. 
line 16141=>     But what be bones that lie in a  hole? 
line 16142=>
line 16143=>####-     Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o' lead, 
line 16144=>     Afore I found his shinbone. 
line 16145=>     Tinbone! Thinbone! 
line 16146=>     He can spare a share for a poor old troll, 
line 16147=>     For he don't need his shinbone.' 
line 16148=> 
line 16149=>     Said Tom: 'I don't see why the likes o' thee 
line 16150=>     Without axin' leave should go makin' free 
line 16151=>     With the shank or the shin o' my father's kin; 
line 16152=>     So hand the old bone over! 
line 16153=>     Rover! Trover! 
line 16154=>     Though dead he be, it belongs to he; 
line 16155=>     So hand the old bone over!'  
line 16156=> 
line 16157=>     'For a couple o' pins,' says Troll, and grins, 
line 16158=>     'I'll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins. 
line 16159=>     A bit o' fresh meal will go down sweet! 
line 16160=>     I'll try my teeth on thee now.  
line 16161=>     Hee now! See now! 
line 16162=>     I'm tired o' gnawing old bones and skins; 
line 16163=>     I've a mind to dine on thee now.' 
line 16164=> 
line 16165=>     But just as he thought his dinner was caught, 
line 16166=>     He found his hands had hold of naught. 
line 16167=>     Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind 
line 16168=>     And gave him the boot to larn him. 
line 16169=>     Warn him! Darn him! 
line 16170=>     A bump o' the boot on the seat, Tom thought, 
line 16171=>     Would be the way to larn him. 
line 16172=> 
line 16173=>     But harder than stone is the flesh and bone 
line 16174=>     Of a troll that sits in the hills alone. 
line 16175=>     As well set your boot to the mountain's root, 
line 16176=>     For the seat of a troll don't feel it. 
line 16177=>     Peel it! Heal it! 
line 16178=>     Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan, 
line 16179=>     And he knew his toes could feel it. 
line 16180=>
line 16181=>####- 
line 16182=>     Tom's leg is game, since home he came, 
line 16183=>     And his bootless foot is lasting lame; 
line 16184=>     But Troll don't care, and he's still there 
line 16185=>     With the bone he boned from its owner. 
line 16186=>     Doner! Boner! 
line 16187=>     Troll's old seat is still the same, 
line 16188=>     And the bone he boned from its owner! 
line 16189=>     'Well, that's a warning to  us all!' laughed Merry. 'It  is as well you  
line 16190=>used a stick, and not your hand, Strider!' 
line 16191=>     'Where did you come  by  tha t, Sam?' asked Pippin.  'I've  never  heard 
line 16192=>those words before.' 
line 16193=>     Sam  muttered  something  inaudible. 'It's  out of  his  own  head,  of 
line 16194=>course,'  said Frodo. 'I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey.  
line 16195=>First he was a conspirator, now he's a  jester.  He'll end up  by becoming a  
line 16196=>wizard - or a warrior!' 
line 16197=>     'I hope not,' said Sam. 'I don't want to be neither!' 
line 16198=>     In  the afternoon  they went  on  down  the  woods. They were  probably 
line 16199=>following the very track  that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves had used many 
line 16200=>years before.  After a  few miles they came  out on the top  of a high  bank  
line 16201=>above the  Road. At this point  the Road had left the Hoarwell far behind in 
line 16202=>its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and 
line 16203=>winding eastward among woods and heather -covered slopes towards the Ford 
line 16204=>and 
line 16205=>the  Mountains.  Not far  down the bank Strider pointed out a  stone in  the 
line 16206=>grass.  On  it roughly  cut  and  now  much weathered  could  still be  seen 
line 16207=>dwarf-runes and secret marks. 
line 16208=>     'There!' said  Merry.  'That  must be the stone  that marked  the place 
line 16209=>where the  trolls' gold  was  hidden.  How much is  left of Bilbo's share, I 
line 16210=>wonder, Frodo?' 
line 16211=>     Frodo looked at the stone,  and wished that  Bilbo had brought home  no 
line 16212=>treasure more perilous, nor  less easy to pan with. 'None  at all,' he said. 
line 16213=>'Bilbo gave it all away. He told me he did not feel it was really his, as it 
line 16214=>came from robbers.' 
line 16215=>     The Road lay quiet under the long  shadows of early  evening. There was 
line 16216=>no sign of any  other  travellers  to be  seen. As  there  was now no  other  
line 16217=>possible course for them to  take,  they climbed down  the bank, and turning 
line 16218=>
line 16219=>####-left went off  as  fast as they could.  Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off 
line 16220=>the  light  of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to  meet them 
line 16221=>from the mountains ahead. 
line 16222=>     They were beginning  to look out  for a place  off the Road, where they 
line 16223=>could camp for the night, when they heard a sound that  brought  sudden fear 
line 16224=>back  into their hearts: the  noise of  hoofs behind them. They looked back, 
line 16225=>but they could not see far because of  the many windings and rollings of the  
line 16226=>Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into 
line 16227=>the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, u ntil they came 
line 16228=>to a small patch of thick-growing hazels.  As they peered out from among the 
line 16229=>bushes, they could see the Road, faint and  grey in  the failing light, some 
line 16230=>thirty feel  below them. The sound of hoofs  drew  nearer.  They were  going  
line 16231=>fast, with a light clippety-clippely-clip. Then faintly,  as if it was blown 
line 16232=>away from  them by the breeze,  they seemed  to catch a dim  ringing, as  of 
line 16233=>small bells tinkling. 
line 16234=>     'That does not sound like a Black Rider's horse!' said Frodo, listening 
line 16235=>intently. The  other  hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not,  but they all 
line 16236=>remained  full of suspicion.  They had been in  fear of pursuit for  so long 
line 16237=>that any sound from  behind seemed ominous and  unfriendly. But Strider  was 
line 16238=>now leaning forward, stooped to the  ground, with a  hand to  his ear, and a  
line 16239=>look of joy on his face. 
line 16240=>     The light faded, and  the leaves on the bushes  rustled softly. Clearer  
line 16241=>and nearer  now the bells jingled, and clippety -clip  came the quick trotting 
line 16242=>feet. Suddenly into view below came a white  horse, gleaming in the shadows,  
line 16243=>running swiftly. In the dusk its  headstall flickered and flashed,  as if it 
line 16244=>were studded with gems  like living stars. The rider's cloak streamed behind 
line 16245=>him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in  the 
line 16246=>wind of his  speed. To  Frodo it  appeared  that a  white  light was shining 
line 16247=>through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil. 
line 16248=>     Strider sprang from hiding and  dashed  down  towards the Road, leaping 
line 16249=>with a cry through  the heather; but even before he  had moved or called, the 
line 16250=>rider  had  reined in  his horse and halted, looking  up towards the thicket 
line 16251=>where  they stood. When he saw  Strider, he dismounted and  ran to meet  him 
line 16252=>calling out: Ai na vedui D®nadan! Mae govannen! His speech and clear 
line 16253=>ringing 
line 16254=>voice left no doubt in their hearts:  the rider  was  of the Elven-folk.  No 
line 16255=>others that dwelt in the wide  world had voices so  fair  to hear. But there 
line 16256=>
line 16257=>####-seemed to be  a note of haste or fear  in his call, and they saw tha t he was 
line 16258=>now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider. 
line 16259=>     Soon Strider  beckoned  to them,  and  the hobbits left  the bushes and 
line 16260=>hurried  down  to the Road. 'This is  Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of 
line 16261=>Elrond,' said Strider. 
line 16262=>     'Hail, and well met  at last!' said the Elf-lord to Frodo. 'I  was sent 
line 16263=>from  Rivendell to look  for you. We feared that you were in danger upon the 
line 16264=>road.' 
line 16265=>     'Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?' cried Frodo joyfully. 
line 16266=>     'No.  He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,' answered 
line 16267=>Glorfindel.  'Elrond received news that  troubled him.  Some of my  kindred,  
line 16268=>journeying  in  your land  beyond the  Baranduin,* learned  that things were 
line 16269=>amiss, and sent  messages as swiftly as they could. They  said that the Nine 
line 16270=>were abroad,  and  that  you  were  astray bearing a  great  burden  without 
line 16271=>guidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that 
line 16272=>can ride openly  against  the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond  sent out 
line 16273=>north,  west, and south.  It was thought  that you  might  turn far aside to 
line 16274=>avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness.  
line 16275=>     'It  was  my  lot  to  take the Road,  and  I  came to  the  Bridge  of 
line 16276=>Mitheithel, and  left a  token  there, nigh  on seven days ago. Three of the 
line 16277=>servants of  Sauron were upon the  Bridge, but  they withdrew  and I pursued 
line 16278=>them westward. I came also  upon two others, but they turned away southward. 
line 16279=>Since then I have  searched  for your  trail. Two days  ago I found  it, and 
line 16280=>followed it over the Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the 
line 16281=>hills again. But come! There is no time for further news. Since you are here 
line 16282=>we must  risk the peril of  the Road and go. There  are five behind us,  and 
line 16283=>when  they find your trail upon the Road  they will   ride after us  like the 
line 16284=>wind.  And they are not all. Where the  other four may be, I  do not know. I 
line 16285=>fear that we may find the Ford is already held against us.' 
line 16286=>     While Glorfindel was speaking  the  shades of evening  deepened.  Frodo 
line 16287=>felt a great weariness come over him. Ever  since the sun began to  sink the 
line 16288=>mist before his eyes had  darkened,  and he  felt  that a  shadow was coming 
line 16289=>between him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt  
line 16290=>cold. He swayed, clutching at Sam's arm. 
line 16291=>     'My master  is  sick and  wounded,' said Sam angrily. 'He  can't go  on 
line 16292=>riding after nightfall. He needs rest.' 
line 16293=>     Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently 
line 16294=>
line 16295=>####-in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety. 
line 16296=>     Briefly Strider told of the attack  on their camp under Weathertop, and 
line 16297=>of  the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it 
line 16298=>to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he  took  it, but he looked  intently at 
line 16299=>it. 
line 16300=>     'There  are evil things written  on  this hilt,' he said; 'though maybe 
line 16301=>your  eyes  cannot see  them.  Keep it, Aragorn,  till we reach the house of 
line 16302=>Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of 
line 16303=>this weapon are beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can -  but all the 
line 16304=>more do I urge you now to go on without rest.' 
line 16305=>     He searched the  wound on Frodo's shoulder with  his  fingers, and  his 
line 16306=>face grew graver, as  if what he learned disquieted  him. But Frodo felt the 
line 16307=>chill lessen in  his  side  and arm;  a little  warmth crept  down from  his 
line 16308=>shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier. The  dusk of evening  seemed  
line 16309=>to grow lighter  about him, as if  a cloud  had been  withdrawn.  He saw his  
line 16310=>friends'  faces more clearly  again, and a  measure of new hope and strength 
line 16311=>returned. 
line 16312=>     'You  shall  ride my  horse,'  said  Glorfindel.  'I will  shorten  the 
line 16313=>stirrups  up to the saddle-skins, and  you must sit as tight as you can. But 
line 16314=>you need not fear: my horse  will not let any rider  fall that I command him 
line 16315=>to bear. His pace is light and smooth;  and if  danger presses  too near, he 
line 16316=>will  bear  you away with a  speed that even  the black steeds of  the enemy 
line 16317=>cannot rival.' 
line 16318=>     'No, he will not!' said  Frodo. 'I  shall  not ride him, if I am to  be 
line 16319=>carried off  to  Rivendell  or anywhere else, leaving  my friends behind  in 
line 16320=>danger.' 
line 16321=>     Glorfindel smiled. 'I doubt very much,' he said, 'if your friends would 
line 16322=>be  in danger if you were  not  with them! The pursuit  would follow you and 
line 16323=>leave  us in  peace, I  think. It is you, Frodo, and that which you bear that 
line 16324=>brings us all in peril.' 
line 16325=>     To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel's 
line 16326=>white  horse.  The pony  was laden instead with a great part  of the others' 
line 16327=>burdens, so that they   now marched lighter, and  for a time made good speed; 
line 16328=>but the hobbits  began  to find it hard to keep up  with the swift  tireless 
line 16329=>feet of the Elf.  On he led them, into the  mouth of darkness,  and still on 
line 16330=>under the deep clouded night. There was neither  star nor moon. Not until the  
line 16331=>grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry, and Sam were  by that 
line 16332=>
line 16333=>####-time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and  even Strider seemed  by the  
line 16334=>sag of his shoulders to be weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream. 
line 16335=>     They  cast  themselves  down  in  the  heather  a  few  yards  from the 
line 16336=>road-side,  and  fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to  have closed 
line 16337=>their eyes when Glorfindel, who  had set himself to watch  while they slept, 
line 16338=>awoke  them again.  The sun had  now climbed far into the  morning, and  the 
line 16339=>clouds and mists of the night were gone. 
line 16340=>     'Drink  this!'  said  Glorfindel  to  them, pouring for  each in turn a  
line 16341=>little liquor from his silver -studded flask  of leather.  It  was  clear  as 
line 16342=>spring  water and  had no taste, and it did not feel either  cool or warm in 
line 16343=>the mouth; but  strength  and vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs  as 
line 16344=>they  drank  it. Eaten after that draught the stale  bread  and dried  fruit 
line 16345=>(which was now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better  
line 16346=>than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done. 
line 16347=>     They had rested rather less than five hours when they  took to the Road 
line 16348=>again. Glorfindel  still  urged them  on, and  only allowed two brief  halts 
line 16349=>during the day's  march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before 
line 16350=>nightfall, and  came  to  a  point where the Road bent  right  and  ran down 
line 16351=>towards the  bottom of the valley,  now making  straight for the Bruinen. So  
line 16352=>far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or  
line 16353=>hear; but often  Glorfindel would  halt and  listen  for  a moment, if  they 
line 16354=>lagged behind,  and a look of anxiety  clouded  his face. Once or  twice  he 
line 16355=>spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue. 
line 16356=>     But  however  anxious  their  guides might be,  it  was plain  that the 
line 16357=>hobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling along dizzy with 
line 16358=>weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs.  Frodo's 
line 16359=>pain had redoubled, and during the day things about him faded to shadows  of 
line 16360=>ghostly grey.  He almost welcomed the coming of  night,  for  then the world 
line 16361=>seemed less pale and empty. 
line 16362=>     The  hobbits  were still  weary,  when  they  set out  again early next 
line 16363=>morning. There were many miles yet to go between them and the Ford, and 
line 16364=>they 
line 16365=>hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage. 
line 16366=>     'Our  peril  will  be  greatest just  ere  we  reach the  river,'  said 
line 16367=>Glorfindel; 'for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind  us,  
line 16368=>and other danger may be waiting by the Ford.' 
line 16369=>     The  Road  was still running steadily downhill,  and there  was now  in 
line 16370=>
line 16371=>####-places much  grass  at either side, in which  the  hobbits walked when  they 
line 16372=>could, to ease  their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came to a  place 
line 16373=>where the  Road went  suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and 
line 16374=>then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes 
line 16375=>ran  along as they hurried  forward; and there seemed to  be a sound of many  
line 16376=>footfalls following their own.  All at once, as if through a  gate of light, 
line 16377=>the Road ran  out again from the end of the tunnel into  the open.  There at 
line 16378=>the bottom  of a sharp incline  they saw before  them a long  flat mile, and 
line 16379=>beyond that  the  Ford of Rivendell. On  the  further side was a steep brown 
line 16380=>bank,  threaded  by  a  winding  path;  and behind  that the tall  mountains 
line 16381=>climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky. 
line 16382=>     There was still an  echo as  of following feet  in  the cutting   behind 
line 16383=>them;  a  rushing noise as  if  a wind were  rising and pouring  through the 
line 16384=>branches of the  pines. One moment Glorfindel turned  and  listened, then he 
line 16385=>sprang forward with a loud cry. 
line 16386=>     'Fly!' he called. 'Fly! The enemy is upon us!' 
line 16387=>     The white  horse  leaped  forward.  The  hobbits ran  down  the  slope. 
line 16388=>Glorfindel and  Strider followed  as  rear -guard.  They were only  half  way 
line 16389=>across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of 
line 16390=>the gate in the  trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined 
line 16391=>his horse  in, and halted,  swaying in his saddle. Another followed him, and 
line 16392=>then another; then again two more. 
line 16393=>     'Ride forward! Ride!' cried Glorfindel to Frodo. 
line 16394=>     He did not obey at  once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking 
line 16395=>the horse to  a  walk,  he turned and looked  back. The Riders seemed to sit 
line 16396=>upon  their  great steeds  like  threatening  statues  upon a hill, dark and 
line 16397=>solid, while all the woods and land about them  receded as  if into a  mist. 
line 16398=>Suddenly he knew  in  his heart that they were  silently commanding  him  to 
line 16399=>wait. Then at  once  fear  and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle 
line 16400=>and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew it. 
line 16401=>     'Ride on! Ride on!' cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called 
line 16402=>to the horse in the elf-tongue: noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth! 
line 16403=>     At once the  white horse sprang away  and  sped like the wind along the 
line 16404=>last lap of  the Road. At the same moment the  black horses leaped  down the 
line 16405=>hill in pursuit, and from  the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had 
line 16406=>heard filling  the woods with  horror in the Eastfarthing  far away.  It was 
line 16407=>answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends  out from the trees and 
line 16408=>
line 16409=>####-rocks  away  on the left four other  Riders came flying.  Two  rode  towards 
line 16410=>Frodo: two  galloped madly towards  the Ford  to  cut  off  his escape. They 
line 16411=>seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as 
line 16412=>their courses converged with his.  
line 16413=>     Frodo looked  back for  a moment over  his shoulder. He could no longer  
line 16414=>see  his friends. The Riders  behind  were  falling  back:  even their great 
line 16415=>steeds  were no match  in  speed for the  white elf-horse of  Glorfindel. He 
line 16416=>looked forward again, and hope fa ded. There seemed no chance of reaching the 
line 16417=>Ford before he  was cut off by  the others that had lain in ambush. He could 
line 16418=>see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black  
line 16419=>cloaks, and they were robed in  white and  grey. Swords were  naked in their  
line 16420=>pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes  glittered,  and they 
line 16421=>called to him with fell voices.  
line 16422=>     Fear now filled all Frodo's mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No 
line 16423=>cry came from him. He shut his eyes  and clung to the horse's mane. The wind 
line 16424=>whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill. A 
line 16425=>breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a  
line 16426=>flash of  white fire, the  elf-horse  speeding as  if on wings, passed right 
line 16427=>before the face of the foremost Rider. 
line 16428=>     Frodo heard  the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the 
line 16429=>quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and struggled up the stony 
line 16430=>path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across the Ford. 
line 16431=>     But the pursuers were close behind. At  the  top of  the bank the horse 
line 16432=>halted and turned  about neighing  fiercely. There were  Nine  Riders at the 
line 16433=>water's edge below, and Frodo's spirit quailed before  the  threat  of their 
line 16434=>uplifted faces. He knew of nothing that would  prevent them from crossing as 
line 16435=>easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over  
line 16436=>the long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge  of Rivendell, if once the 
line 16437=>Riders crossed. In any case he felt that  he was commanded urgently to halt.  
line 16438=>Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse. 
line 16439=>     Suddenly the foremost  Rider  spurred  his horse forward. It checked at 
line 16440=>the water and  reared  up.  With  a  great  effort  Frodo  sat  upright  and 
line 16441=>brandished his sword. 
line 16442=>     'Go back!' he cried. 'Go  back to  the Land of Mordor, and follow me no 
line 16443=>more! '  His voice sounded  thin and shrill  in his  own  ears.  The  Riders 
line 16444=>halted, but Frodo had not  the power of Bombadil. His enemies laughed at him 
line 16445=>with  a harsh and chilling laughter. 'Come back! Come back!' they called. 'To 
line 16446=>
line 16447=>####-Mordor we will take you!' 
line 16448=>     'Go back!' he whispered. 
line 16449=>     'The Ring! The  Ring!'  they cried with  deadly voices; and immediately 
line 16450=>their leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by two 
line 16451=>others. 
line 16452=>     'By Elbereth  and L®thien  the Fair,' said Frodo  with  a last  effort, 
line 16453=>lifting up his sword, 'you shall have neither the Ring nor me!' 
line 16454=>     Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in 
line 16455=>his  stirrups, and raised up his hand.  Frodo was stricken dumb. He felt his 
line 16456=>tongue  cleave to  his mouth,  and  his heart labouring. His sword broke and  
line 16457=>fell out of his shaking hand. The elf-horse reared and snorted. The foremost  
line 16458=>of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore. 
line 16459=>     At that moment there  came a roaring and  a rushing: a  noise  of  loud 
line 16460=>waters rolling many stones. Dimly  Frodo saw the river below him  rise,  and 
line 16461=>down along its course there  came a  plumed cavalry of  waves.  White flames 
line 16462=>seemed to Frodo to  flicker on their crests  and he half fancied that he saw 
line 16463=>amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three 
line 16464=>Riders  that  were still in  the midst of  the  Ford were  overwhelmed: they 
line 16465=>disappeared, buried su ddenly under angry  foam.  Those that were behind drew 
line 16466=>back in dismay. 
line 16467=>     With his  last failing senses Frodo  heard cries,  and it seemed to him 
line 16468=>that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure 
line 16469=>of white light;  and behind it ran small shadowy forms  waving flames,  that 
line 16470=>flared red in the grey mist that was falling over the world. 
line 16471=>     The  black  horses were  filled  with madness, and leaping  forward  in 
line 16472=>terror  they bore their riders  into the rushing flood. Their piercing cries 
line 16473=>were drowned in the roaring of the river as it carried them away. Then Frodo 
line 16474=>felt himself  falling,  and  the  roaring and  confusion seemed  to rise and 
line 16475=>engulf him together with his enemies. He heard and saw no more. 
line 16476=> 
line 16477=>
line 16478=>####-* BOOK II *  
line 16479=>
line 16480=> 
line 16481=> 
line 16482=>
line 16483=>Chapter 1. Many Meetings 
line 16484=>
line 16485=> 
line 16486=> 
line 16487=>     Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that  he 
line 16488=>had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge 
line 16489=>of memory. Or  perhaps he  had been ill? But  the ceiling looked strange; it 
line 16490=>was flat, and it had dark beams richly carved. He lay  a little while longer  
line 16491=>looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the  sound of a  
line 16492=>waterfall. 
line 16493=>     `Where am  I, and what is the time?' he said aloud to the  ceiling. 'In 
line 16494=>the  House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in  the morning.' said  a voice. 
line 16495=>`It is the morning of October the twenty -fourth, if you want to know.' 
line 16496=>     `Gandalf!'  cried  Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting 
line 16497=>in a chair by the open window.  
line 16498=>     `Yes,' he said, `I am here.  And you  are lucky  to be here, too, after  
line 16499=>all the absurd  things you  have done since  you left home.' Frodo lay  down 
line 16500=>again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did 
line 16501=>not think he would get the better of  an argument.  He  was fully awake now,  
line 16502=>and  the memory of  his  journey  was returning: the  disastrous `short cut' 
line 16503=>through the Old Forest the `accident' at The Prancing Pony;  and his madness 
line 16504=>in putting  on the Ring  in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking 
line 16505=>of all these  things and trying  in  vain to  bring  his memory down to  his 
line 16506=>arriving  in  Rivendell, there  was a long  silence, broken only by the soft  
line 16507=>puffs of Gandalf's pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window.  
line 16508=>     'Where's Sam?' Frodo asked at length. 'And are the others all right?' 
line 16509=>     'Yes, they are  all  safe  and sound,' answered Gandalf.  `Sam was here 
line 16510=>until I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour ago.' 
line 16511=>     `What happened at the Ford?' said Frodo. `It all seemed so dim somehow; 
line 16512=>and it still does.' 
line 16513=>     'Yes,  it  would.  You were beginning to fade,' answered  Gandalf. 'The 
line 16514=>wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and you  would have  
line 16515=>been 
line 16516=>beyond  our aid.  But you have some strength in you, my dear  hobbit! As you 
line 16517=>showed in the  Barrow. That was touch and  go: perhaps  the  most  dangerous 
line 16518=>
line 16519=>####-moment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.' 
line 16520=>     'You seem to know a great deal already,' said Frodo. `I have not spoken 
line 16521=>to the others about the Barrow. At first it was too horrible; and afterwards 
line 16522=>there were other things to think about. How do you know about it?' 
line 16523=>     'You have talked long  in your sleep, Frodo,' said Gandalf gently, 'and 
line 16524=>it  has not been hard  for me to  read  your mind and memory. Do not  worry! 
line 16525=>Though I said  "absurd" just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you-and 
line 16526=>of the others. It is  no small  feat to have come so far,  and  through such 
line 16527=>dangers, still bearing the Ring.' 
line 16528=>     'We should  never  have done it  without Strider,' said Frodo. `But  we 
line 16529=>needed you. I did not know what to do without you.' 
line 16530=>     'I was delayed,'  said Gandalf, `and that  nearly proved our  ruin. And 
line 16531=>yet I am not sure; it may have been better so.' 
line 16532=>     'I wish you would tell me what happened!' 
line 16533=>     'All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything 
line 16534=>today, by Elrond's orders.' 
line 16535=>     `But  talking would stop me thinking and wondering,  which are quite as 
line 16536=>tiring,' said Frodo.  'I am wide awake  now, and  I remember so many  things 
line 16537=>that want explaining. Why  were you delayed?  You  ought to tell me that  at 
line 16538=>least.' 
line 16539=>     'You will soon hear all you wish to know,' said Gandalf. 'We shall have 
line 16540=>a Council, as soon as you are  well enough. At the  moment  I will only  say 
line 16541=>that I was held captive.' 
line 16542=>     'You?' cried Frodo. 
line 16543=>     'Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,'  said the wizard solemnly.  'There are many 
line 16544=>powers  in  the world,  for good  or for evil. Some are  greater  than I am. 
line 16545=>Against  some  I  have not  yet been measured. But my  time  is  coming. The 
line 16546=>Morgul-lord and his Black Riders have come forth. War is preparing!' 
line 16547=>     `Then you knew of the Riders already -before I met them?' 
line 16548=>     'Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black  
line 16549=>Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings.  But 
line 16550=>I did not know  that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at 
line 16551=>once. I heard news  of them only after  I left you in  June; but that  story 
line 16552=>must wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.' 
line 16553=>     'Yes,'  said Frodo, `it was Strider that saved  us. Yet I was afraid of 
line 16554=>him at first. Sam never quite trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we 
line 16555=>met Glorfindel.' 
line 16556=>
line 16557=>####-     Gandalf smiled. `I have heard all about  Sam,' he said. 'He has no more 
line 16558=>doubts now.' 
line 16559=>     'I am glad,' said Frodo. 'For I have become very fond of Strider. Well, 
line 16560=>fond is not the right word.  I mean he is dear to me; though he  is strange, 
line 16561=>and grim  at times. In fact, he reminds  me often of you. I didn't know that 
line 16562=>any of the Big People were  like that.  I thought, well, that  they were just 
line 16563=>big, and rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked 
line 16564=>like  Bill Ferny. But then we don't know much about Men in the Shire, except 
line 16565=>perhaps the Breelanders.' 
line 16566=>     `You  don't know  much  even  about them, if you  think old Barliman is 
line 16567=>stupid,' said Gandalf. 'He is wise enough on his  own ground. He thinks less 
line 16568=>than  he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick wall  in time (as 
line 16569=>they say in Bree). But there are few left in  Middle-earth  like Aragorn son 
line 16570=>of Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It 
line 16571=>may be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure.' 
line 16572=>     'Do  you  really  mean that  Strider is one  of the people of  the  old 
line 16573=>Kings?' said Frodo in wonder.  `I thought  they had all vanished long ago. I 
line 16574=>thought he was only a Ranger.' 
line 16575=>     'Only a Ranger!' cried Gandalf. `My dear Frodo,  that  is just what the 
line 16576=>Rangers are: the last  remnant in the North  of the great people, the Men of 
line 16577=>the  West.  They have helped  me  before; and I shall need their help in the 
line 16578=>days  to come;  for we  have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is  not yet  at 
line 16579=>rest.' 
line 16580=>     'I suppose not,' said Frodo. 'But  so far my  only thought has been  to 
line 16581=>get here; and  I  hope I  shan't have to go any further. It is very pleasant 
line 16582=>just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has 
line 16583=>been as much as I want.' 
line 16584=>     He fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. 'I have 
line 16585=>been reckoning,' he said, `and I can't bring  the  total up  to October  the 
line 16586=>twenty-fourth. It ought to  be  the  twenty-first. We  must have reached the 
line 16587=>Ford by the twentieth.' 
line 16588=>     'You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,' said Gandalf.  
line 16589=>`How do the side and shou lder feel now?' 
line 16590=>     'I don't know.' Frodo  answered. 'They don't feel at all: which  is  an 
line 16591=>improvement, but'--he made  an  effort--'I can move my  arm again a  little. 
line 16592=>Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,' he added, touching his left  
line 16593=>hand with  his right. 
line 16594=>
line 16595=>####-     `Good!'  said  Gandalf.  `It is  mending  fast. You will soon be  sound 
line 16596=>again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were 
line 16597=>brought in.' 
line 16598=>     'Days?' said Frodo. 
line 16599=>     `Well, four nights and three days,  to be  exact. The Elves brought you  
line 16600=>from this where you lost  count.  We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has 
line 16601=>hardly left  your  side, day or night, except to run  messages. Elrond is  a  
line 16602=>master of healing, but the weapons of  our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the 
line 16603=>truth, I had very little hope; for  I suspected that there was some fragment 
line 16604=>of the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be found until last  
line 16605=>night.  Then Elrond  removed a  splinter. It  was deeply  buried. and it was 
line 16606=>working inwards.' 
line 16607=>     Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife  with notched  blade  that 
line 16608=>had vanished in Strider's  hands. `Don't be alarmed!' said Gandalf.  `It  is 
line 16609=>gone  now.  It  has  been  melted.  And  it  seems  that  Hobbits fade  very 
line 16610=>reluctantly.  I  have known strong  warriors of  the Big  People  who  would 
line 16611=>quickly have  been overcome by  that splinter, which you bore  for seventeen 
line 16612=>days.' 
line 16613=>     `What would they have done  to me?' asked Frodo. `What  were the Riders 
line 16614=>trying to do?' 
line 16615=>     'They tried to pierce your heart with a  Morgul-knife  which remains in 
line 16616=>the wound. If they had succeeded, you would  have become like they are, only 
line 16617=>weaker and  under their  command. You  would have became a wraith under  
line 16618=>the 
line 16619=>dominion of  the Dark Lord;  and he would have tormented you   for trying  to 
line 16620=>keep his Ring,  if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it 
line 16621=>and seeing it on his hand.' 
line 16622=>     'Thank goodness  I  did  not  realize the horrible danger!' said  Frodo 
line 16623=>faintly. I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had k nown more, I should 
line 16624=>not have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I escaped!' 
line 16625=>     'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,' said Gandalf,  `not  to mention 
line 16626=>courage. For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; 
line 16627=>and that  was because you resisted to the last. But it was a terribly narrow 
line 16628=>shave, so to  speak. You were in gravest peril while you  wore the Ring, for  
line 16629=>then you were half in the wraith-world yourself, and they might have  seized  
line 16630=>you. You could see them, and they could see you. ' 
line 16631=>     `I know,' said Frodo.  `They were terrible to behold! But why  could we 
line 16632=>
line 16633=>####-all see their horses?' 
line 16634=>     `Because  they are real horses; just as the black robes are real  robes 
line 16635=>that they wear to give shape  to their  nothingness when  they have dealings 
line 16636=>with the living.' 
line 16637=>     `Then  why do these black  horses endure such riders? All other animals 
line 16638=>are terrified when  they draw  near, even  the elf-horse of  Glorfindel. The 
line 16639=>dogs howl and the geese scream at them.' 
line 16640=>     `Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord 
line 16641=>in Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! There are orcs and 
line 16642=>trolls, there are wargs  and werewolves; and there have been  and  still are 
line 16643=>many Men,  warriors and kings,  that walk alive under  the  Sun, and yet are 
line 16644=>under his sway. And their number is growing daily.' 
line 16645=>     `What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?' 
line 16646=>     `Yes,  at present,  until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear the 
line 16647=>Dark Lord, and they may fly before him, but  never aga in will they listen to 
line 16648=>him or serve him. And here in Rivendell there live  still some of his  chief 
line 16649=>foes: the Elven-wise, lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas. They  
line 16650=>do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the  Blessed  Realm 
line 16651=>live at  once in both worlds, and against both the  Seen and the Unseen they 
line 16652=>have great power.' 
line 16653=>     'I  thought that I saw  a white figure that shone and did not  grow dim 
line 16654=>like the others. Was that Glorfindel then?' 
line 16655=>     'Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the 
line 16656=>mighty  of  the Firstborn. He is an Elf-lord  of a  house of princes. Indeed 
line 16657=>there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while: 
line 16658=>and elsewhere other powers still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind 
line 16659=>in the Shire. But all  such places will soon  become islands under siege, if 
line 16660=>things  go  on  as they are going. The Dark  Lord is  putting forth all  his 
line 16661=>strength. 
line 16662=>     `Still,' he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin. while 
line 16663=>his beard went  stiff and straight like bristling wire, `we must keep up our 
line 16664=>courage. You will  soon be  well, if I do not talk you  to death. You are in 
line 16665=>Rivendell, and you need not worry about anything for the present.' 
line 16666=>     'I haven't any courage to  keep up,'  said Frodo, `but I am not worried 
line 16667=>at  the moment. Just give me news of my friends, and tell  me the end of the  
line 16668=>affair at the  Ford, as I  keep on asking,  and I shall be  content  for the 
line 16669=>present. After that  I  shall have  another sleep, I  think; but I shan't be 
line 16670=>
line 16671=>####-able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me.' 
line 16672=>     Gandalf moved  his chair to the bedside, and took a good look at Frodo. 
line 16673=>The colour  had come  back to his face, and his  eyes were clear, and  fully 
line 16674=>awake  and aware. He was smiling,  and there seemed to be  little wrong with 
line 16675=>him. But to the wizard's eye there was a faint change just a hint as it were 
line 16676=>of transparency,  about  him, and especially  about  the left  hand that lay 
line 16677=>outside upon the coverlet. 
line 16678=>     `Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself. `He is not half 
line 16679=>through  yet,  and to what  he  will  come in the  end  not even  Elrond can 
line 16680=>foretell. Not  to evil, I think. He may become  like a glass filled  with  a  
line 16681=>clear light for eyes to see that can.' 
line 16682=>     `You look splendid,' he  said aloud. `I  will risk a brief tale without 
line 16683=>consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, and then you must sleep again. 
line 16684=>This is what happened, as far  as I can gather. The Riders made straight for  
line 16685=>you, as soon as you fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses any  
line 16686=>longer: you  had become visible to  them, being already on the threshold  of 
line 16687=>their world. And also the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the 
line 16688=>road, or they would have been ridden down. They knew that nothing could save 
line 16689=>you,  if  the white horse could  not. The Riders were too swift to overtake, 
line 16690=>and too many to oppose.  On foot even  Glorfindel and Aragorn together could 
line 16691=>not with stand all the Nine at once. 
line 16692=>     `When the Ringwraiths  swept  by, your friends ran up behind.  Close to 
line 16693=>the Ford  there is a small hollow  beside  the  road masked by a few stunted 
line 16694=>trees.  There they hastily  kindled fire; for  Glorfindel knew that a  flood 
line 16695=>would come down, if  the Riders  tried  to cross,  and then he would have to 
line 16696=>deal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the  flood 
line 16697=>appeared, he rushed  out, followed by  Aragorn and the. others  with flaming  
line 16698=>brands. Caught between  fire and water, and seeing  an Elf-lord revealed  in 
line 16699=>his wrath, they were dismayed, and their  horses were stricken with madness. 
line 16700=>Three were  carried away by the first assault  of the flood; the others were 
line 16701=>now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.' 
line 16702=>     'And is that the end of the Black Riders?' asked Frodo. 
line 16703=>     'No,' said Gandalf. 'Their horses must have perished,  and without them 
line 16704=>they  are crippled.  But  the  Ringwraiths  themselves cannot  be  so easily 
line 16705=>destroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. Your 
line 16706=>friends crossed after the  flood had passed; and they found you lying on your  
line 16707=>face at the top of the  bank, with  a broken sword under you. The horse  was 
line 16708=>
line 16709=>####-standing guard beside you. You were  pale and cold, and they feared that you 
line 16710=>were  dead,  or  worse.  Elrond's folk met them, carrying you slowly towards 
line 16711=>Rivendell.' 
line 16712=>     `Who made the flood?' asked Frodo. 
line 16713=>     'Elrond  commanded it,' answered  Gandalf. `The river of this valley is 
line 16714=>under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the 
line 16715=>Ford.  As soon as the  captain  of the Ringwraiths rode into  the  water the 
line 16716=>flood was released.  If I may say so, I added a few touches of  my  own: you  
line 16717=>may  not have noticed, but some of the waves  took the  form of  great white 
line 16718=>horses with shining  white riders; and there wer e many rolling and  grinding 
line 16719=>boulders. For a moment  I was afraid that  we  had let  loose too  fierce  a  
line 16720=>wrath, and the flood would get out of hand  and  wash you all away. There is 
line 16721=>great vigour  in  the  waters  that come down  from the snows  of  the Misty 
line 16722=>Mountains.' 
line 16723=>     `Yes,  it all  comes  back  to  me now,'  said  Frodo:  'the tremendous 
line 16724=>roaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends  and enemies and all. But 
line 16725=>now we are safe!' 
line 16726=>     Gandalf  looked quickly at Frodo,  but he had shut his  eyes. 'Yes, you  
line 16727=>are all safe for the present. Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to 
line 16728=>celebrate the  victory at the Ford  of Bruinen, and you will all be there in 
line 16729=>places of honour.' 
line 16730=>     'Splendid!' said Frodo. `It is  wonderful  that Elrond, and  Glorfindel 
line 16731=>and such great lords, not to  mention Strider, should take so  much  trouble 
line 16732=>and show me so much kindness.' 
line 16733=>     `Well, there  are many reasons why they should,' said Gandalf, smiling. 
line 16734=>`I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are the Ring-bearer.  And you  
line 16735=>are the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder.' 
line 16736=>     `Dear Bilbo!' said Frodo sleepily. `I wonder where he is. I wish he was 
line 16737=>here and could hear  all  about it.  It would have  made  him laugh, The cow 
line 16738=>jumped  over the  Moon!  And  the poor old troll!'  With that he  fell  fast  
line 16739=>asleep. 
line 16740=>     Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea. That house 
line 16741=>was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, `a perfect house, whether you like food 
line 16742=>or sleep, or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or 
line 16743=>a  pleasant  mixture  of  them all'.  Merely  to  be  there was  a cure  for  
line 16744=>weariness, fear, and sadness.  
line 16745=>     As the evening drew on, Frodo  woke up again, and he found  that  he no 
line 16746=>
line 16747=>####-longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and drink, and 
line 16748=>probably  for singing and story-telling  afterwards. He got  out of  bed and 
line 16749=>discovered that his  arm was  already nearly as useful again as it ever  had 
line 16750=>been. He found  laid ready  clean garments  of  green cloth that  fitted him 
line 16751=>excellently. Looking  in a mirror  he  was  startled to see  a  much thinner  
line 16752=>reflection  of  himself than  he remembered: it  looked remarkably like  the 
line 16753=>young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping  with his uncle in  the Shire; 
line 16754=>but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully. 
line 16755=>     `Yes, you  have seen a thing or two since  you last  peeped  out  of  a  
line 16756=>looking-glass,' he said to his reflection. 'But now for a merry meeting!' 
line 16757=>     He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune. 
line 16758=>     At that moment there  was a knock on the door,  and Sam came in. He ran 
line 16759=>to Frodo and took his left hand,  awkwardly and shyly. He stroked it  gently  
line 16760=>and then he blushed and turned hastily away. 
line 16761=>     `Hullo, Sam!' said Frodo. 
line 16762=>     `It's  warm!' said Sam. `Meaning your hand, Mr.  Frodo. It has  felt so 
line 16763=>cold through  the long nights. But glory  and trumpets!'  he cried,  turning 
line 16764=>round again with shining  eyes and dancing  on  the floor. 'It's fine to see 
line 16765=>you up and yourself again, sir! Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were 
line 16766=>ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.' 
line 16767=>     'I  am ready,' said Frodo.  'Let's  go  and  look  for the rest  of the 
line 16768=>party!' 
line 16769=>     `I can  take you to them,  sir,' said Sam. `It's a  big house this, and 
line 16770=>very  peculiar. Always a bit more to discover,  and no  knowing  what  you'll 
line 16771=>find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves  here, and Elves there! Some like 
line 16772=>kings, terrible and splendid;  and some  as merry as children. And the music 
line 16773=>and the singing-not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening 
line 16774=>since we got here. But I'm getting to know some of the ways of the place.' 
line 16775=>     'I know  what you have  been doing,  Sam,' said Frodo,  taking his arm. 
line 16776=>'But you  shall be merry tonight,  and listen to your  heart's content. Come 
line 16777=>on, guide me round the corners!' 
line 16778=>     Sam led him  along several passages and down many steps and out  into a 
line 16779=>high garden above the  steep bank of the river. He found his friends sitting 
line 16780=>in a  porch on the side of the house looking east. Shadows had fallen in the 
line 16781=>valley below,  but there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far 
line 16782=>above. The air was warm. The sound of running  and falling  water  was loud, 
line 16783=>and the evening  was filled with a  faint scent  of trees and flowers, as if 
line 16784=>
line 16785=>####-summer still lingered in Elrond's gardens.  
line 16786=>     `Hurray!' cried Pippin, springing  up.  `Here is our noble cousin! Make 
line 16787=>way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!' 
line 16788=>     'Hush!' said Gandalf from the shadows at the back  of the  porch. `Evil 
line 16789=>things do  not  come into this valley; but all  the same we should not  name 
line 16790=>them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of 
line 16791=>Mordor, whose  power is  again stretching out over the world! We are sitting  
line 16792=>in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.' 
line 16793=>     `Gandalf  has been saying many cheerful things like that,' said Pippin. 
line 16794=>`He thinks I need keeping in  order.  But it  seems impossible, somehow,  to  
line 16795=>feel  gloomy or depressed in  this place. I feel I could sing, if I knew the 
line 16796=>right song for the occasion.' 
line 16797=>     `I feel  like singing myself,' laughed Frodo. `Thou gh  at the moment  I  
line 16798=>feel more like eating and drinking!' 
line 16799=>     `That  will  soon  be cured,'  said  Pippin. `You have shown your usual 
line 16800=>cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.' 
line 16801=>     `More than meal!  A  feast!'  said  Merry. `As soon as Gandalf reported 
line 16802=>that  you were  recovered, the  preparations began.' He  had hardly finished 
line 16803=>speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells. 
line 16804=>     The  hall of Elrond's house was filled with folk: Elves  for  the  most  
line 16805=>part,  though there wer e a  few guests of other  sorts.  Elrond, as  was his 
line 16806=>custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and 
line 16807=>next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.  
line 16808=>     Frodo looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen Elrond, of 
line 16809=>whom  so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his right hand and his left,  
line 16810=>Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were 
line 16811=>revealed 
line 16812=>as lords of dignity and power. Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other 
line 16813=>two; but his  long  white  hair, his  sweeping silver beard, and  his  broad 
line 16814=>shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient  legend. In his aged 
line 16815=>face under  great snowy brows  his dark eyes  were set like coals that could 
line 16816=>leap suddenly into fire. 
line 16817=>     Glorfindel  was tall and straight;  his  hair was of shining gold,  his 
line 16818=>face fair and young and fearless and full  of  joy; his eyes were bright and 
line 16819=>keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and  in his hand was 
line 16820=>strength. 
line 16821=>     The face  of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was 
line 16822=>
line 16823=>####-written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His hair was dark 
line 16824=>as the shadows of twilight, and upon  it  was set  a circlet  of silver; his 
line 16825=>eyes were grey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light of 
line 16826=>stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale 
line 16827=>as  a tried warrior in  the  fulness  of  his strength.  He was the Lord  of 
line 16828=>Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men. 
line 16829=>     In  the  middle of the table, against  the  woven cloths upon the wall, 
line 16830=>there  was a chair under  a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look  upon, 
line 16831=>and so like was she in form of womanhood  to Elrond that Frodo  guessed that 
line 16832=>she was one of his  close kindred. Young she was  and yet not so. The braids 
line 16833=>of her dark  hair were touched  by no frost, her white arms and  clear  face 
line 16834=>were  flawless and smooth,  and the light  of stars was in  her bright eyes,  
line 16835=>grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked, and thought and knowledge 
line 16836=>were in  her  glance, as  of  one  who has known  many things that the years 
line 16837=>bring. Above her brow her head was covered with  a cap of silver lace netted 
line 16838=>with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament 
line 16839=>save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver. 
line 16840=>     So it was  that Frodo saw  her whom few  mortals  had yet seen;  Arwen,  
line 16841=>daughter  of Elrond,  in whom it  was said  that the likeness of L®thien had 
line 16842=>come on earth again; and she was called  Undumiel, for she was  the Evenstar 
line 16843=>of her people. Long she had been in the land of her mother's kin,  in Lurien 
line 16844=>beyond  the mountains,  and  was  but  lately  returned to Rivendell  to her  
line 16845=>father's  house.  But  her  brothers, Elladan and  Elrohir,  were  out  upon 
line 16846=>errantry: for  they rode often far  afield with the  Rangers  of  the North, 
line 16847=>forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the orcs.  
line 16848=>     Such loveliness  in  living  thing  Frodo had  never  seen  before  nor  
line 16849=>imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed to find  that he 
line 16850=>had a seat at  Elrond's table among all these  folk so high and fair. Though 
line 16851=>he had a suitable chair, and was raised upon several  cushions, he felt very 
line 16852=>small, and  rather out of place; but that  feeling quickly passed. The feast  
line 16853=>was  merry and  the food all that his  hunger could desire. It was some time 
line 16854=>before he looked about him again or even turned to his neighbours. 
line 16855=>     He  looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be  allowed to wait 
line 16856=>on his  master, but had been  told that  for this  time he  was  a  guest of 
line 16857=>honour. Frodo could see him  now, sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper  
line 16858=>end  of  one of  the side-tables close to  the dais. He could see no sign of 
line 16859=>Strider. 
line 16860=>
line 16861=>####-     Next to Frodo  on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly 
line 16862=>dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was  white, nearly as white as the 
line 16863=>snow-white cloth  of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck  
line 16864=>hung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him. 
line 16865=>     'Welcome  and well met!'  said the dwarf, turning towards  him. Then he 
line 16866=>actually rose from his seat and bowed. `Gluin at your service,' he said, and 
line 16867=>bowed still lower. 
line 16868=>     'Frodo  Baggins  at  your  service  and  your   family's,'  said  Frodo 
line 16869=>correctly, rising  in surprise and scattering  his cushions. 'Am I right  in 
line 16870=>guessing that you are the  Gluin, one of the twelve companions of the  great 
line 16871=>Thorin Oakenshield?' 
line 16872=>     `Quite  right,'  answered  the dwarf,  gathering up  the  cushions  and 
line 16873=>courteously assist ing  Frodo back  into his seat. 'And I do  not ask, for  I 
line 16874=>have  already been  told that you  are  the  kinsman and adopted heir of our 
line 16875=>friend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.' 
line 16876=>     `Thank you very much,' said Frodo. 
line 16877=>     'You have had  some very strange  adventures, I hear,'  said  Gluin. 'I  
line 16878=>wonder greatly  what brings  four hobbits  on so long a journey. Nothing like 
line 16879=>it  has happened  since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire 
line 16880=>too closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?' 
line 16881=>     'I  think  we  will not  speak  of it,  at least not  yet,' said  Frodo 
line 16882=>politely. 
line 16883=>     He guessed that  even in Elrond's house the matter of  the Ring was not 
line 16884=>one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his  troubles for a  
line 16885=>time. 'But  I am  equally  curious,'  he  added,  `to learn what  brings  so 
line 16886=>important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.' 
line 16887=>     Gluin looked at him. 'If you have not heard, I  think we will not speak 
line 16888=>yet  of that either. Master  Elrond will summon us all ere long,  I believe, 
line 16889=>and  then we shall all hear many things. But there is much else that  may be 
line 16890=>told.' 
line 16891=>     Throughout the  rest  of  the  meal  they talked  together,  but  Frodo 
line 16892=>listened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart from the Ring, 
line 16893=>seemed small and far-away and unimportant. while  Gluin had much to tell  of 
line 16894=>events in the northern regions of Wilderland.  Frodo  learned that Grimbeorn 
line 16895=>the Old, son of  Beorn, was now the lord  of  many sturdy men ,  and to their  
line 16896=>land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go.  
line 16897=>     'lndeed,' said Gluin,  `if it were not for  the  Beornings, the passage 
line 16898=>
line 16899=>####-from  Dale  to Rivendell  would long  ago  have become  impossible. They are 
line 16900=>valiant men and keep open  the High Pass  and the Ford of Carrock. But their 
line 16901=>tolls are high,' he added with a shake of his  head;  `and like Beorn of old 
line 16902=>they are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty,  and that is much 
line 16903=>in these days. Nowhere are there any men so friendly to  us  as the  Men  of 
line 16904=>Dale. They  are  good  folk,  the Bardings. The  grandson of Bard the Bowman 
line 16905=>rules  them,  Brand son of Bain  son of Bard. He is a  strong king.  and his 
line 16906=>realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth.' 
line 16907=>     'And what of your own people?' asked Frodo. 
line 16908=>     `There is much  to tell, good and bad,' said  Gluin; 'yet it  is mostly 
line 16909=>good:  we have so far been fortunate, though  we do not escape the shadow of 
line 16910=>these  times. If you  really  wish  to  hear of us, I will tell  you tidings 
line 16911=>gladly.  But stop  me when  you are  weary!  Dwarves'  tongues  run  on when 
line 16912=>speaking of their handiwork, they say.' 
line 16913=>     And with that  Gluin embarked on a long  account of the doings  of  the 
line 16914=>Dwarf-kingdom.  He  was delighted  to have found  so polite a  listener; for  
line 16915=>Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, 
line 16916=>though  actually he  soon  got rather lost among the strange names of people 
line 16917=>and places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to 
line 16918=>hear that Dbin was  still  King under the  Mountain, and was now old (having 
line 16919=>passed  his two hundred  and fiftieth year), venerable, and fabulously rich. 
line 16920=>Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies  seven were 
line 16921=>still with him: Dwalin, Gluin, Dori, Nori,  Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur 
line 16922=>was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at 
line 16923=>table, and it took six young dwarves to lift him. 
line 16924=>     'And what has become of Balin and Ori and Uin?' asked Frodo. 
line 16925=>     A shadow passed  over Gluin's face.  `We do not know,' he answered. 'It 
line 16926=>is largely  on account of  Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those 
line 16927=>that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight let us speak of merrier things!' 
line 16928=>     Gluin began then  to talk  of the works of  his  people,  telling Frodo 
line 16929=>about their  great  labours in Dale  and under the  Mountain. 'We have  done 
line 16930=>well,' he  said. `But  in  metalwork  we cannot rival  our fathers, many  of 
line 16931=>whose. secrets are lost. We make good armour and keen swords, but  we cannot 
line 16932=>again make mail or blade  to match  those  that were  made before the dragon 
line 16933=>came. Only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days. You should 
line 16934=>see  the  waterways of Dale,  Frodo, and the fountains, and  the pools!  You  
line 16935=>should  see  the  stone-paved roads  of  many  colours! And  the  halls  and 
line 16936=>
line 16937=>####-cavernous streets under the earth with  arches  carved  like trees;  and the 
line 16938=>terraces and  towers upon the Mountain's  sides! Then you would  see that we 
line 16939=>have not been idle.' 
line 16940=>     'I will come and see them, if  ever I can,' said  Frodo. 'How surprised 
line 16941=>Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of Smaug!' 
line 16942=>     Gluin looked at Frodo and smiled. 'You were very fond of Bilbo were you 
line 16943=>not?' he asked. 
line 16944=>     `Yes,' answered Frodo. 'I would rather see him than all  the towers and 
line 16945=>palaces in the world.' 
line 16946=>     At length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down 
line 16947=>the hall, and the company followed them in due  order. The doors were thrown 
line 16948=>open, and they went across a  wide passage and through other doors, and came 
line 16949=>into a further hall.  In it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in 
line 16950=>a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side. 
line 16951=>     Frodo found himself  walking with  Gandalf. `This  is the Hall of Fire' 
line 16952=>said the wizard.  `Here you will hear many songs and  tales-if you  can keep 
line 16953=>awake. But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people 
line 16954=>come here who wish for peace,  and thought. There is always a fire here, all  
line 16955=>the year round, but there is little other light.' 
line 16956=>     As Elrond entered and  went towards  the seat prepared for  him, elvish 
line 16957=>minstrels began to  make sweet  music.  Slowly  the hall  filled,  and Frodo 
line 16958=>looked  with delight upon  the many  fair faces that were gathered together; 
line 16959=>the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in  their hair. Suddenly 
line 16960=>he noticed, not far from the further  end of  the fire, a small dark  figure 
line 16961=>seated on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on  the 
line 16962=>ground was a drinking-cup  and some bread. Frodo wondered whether he was 
line 16963=>ill 
line 16964=>(if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been unable  to  come to the 
line 16965=>feast. His head seemed sunk  in sleep on  his breast, and a fold of his dark 
line 16966=>cloak was drawn over his face. 
line 16967=>     Elrond wen t forward and stood beside the  silent figure. 'Awake  little 
line 16968=>master.  he  said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo, he beckoned to him. 
line 16969=>'Now  at last  the hour has come that you have wished  for, Frodo,' he said. 
line 16970=>`Here is a friend that you have long missed.' 
line 16971=>     The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face. 
line 16972=>     `Bilbo!' cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward. 
line 16973=>     `Hullo, Frodo my  lad!' said Bilbo.  `So  you have got here at  last. I 
line 16974=>
line 16975=>####-hoped you would manage it. Well,  well! So  all this  feasting  is  in  your 
line 16976=>honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself?' 
line 16977=>     'Why weren't  you there?' cried Frodo.  `And why haven't I been allowed 
line 16978=>to see you before?' 
line 16979=>     `Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by 
line 16980=>your  side with Sam each day. But as for  the feast` I don't go in  for such 
line 16981=>things much now. And I had something else to do.' 
line 16982=>     `What were you doing?' 
line 16983=>     `Why, sitting and thinking.  I do  a lot of that  nowadays, and this is 
line 16984=>the best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!' he said, cocking an 
line 16985=>eye at Elrond.  There was a  bright  twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness 
line 16986=>that Frodo could see. `Wake up! I was not asleep. Master Elrond. If you want 
line 16987=>to  know,  you  have  all come  out from your  feast too  soon, and  you have 
line 16988=>disturbed me-in the middle of making up a song. I was stuck  over a line  or  
line 16989=>two, and was thinking  about them; but  now I don't suppose I shall ever get  
line 16990=>them right.  There will  be such a deal of singing  that  the  ideas wi ll be 
line 16991=>driven clean out  of my head.  I  shall have to get my friend the D®nadan to 
line 16992=>help me. Where is he?' 
line 16993=>     Elrond laughed. `He  shall  be found,' he  said. `Then you two shall go 
line 16994=>into a corner  and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before 
line 16995=>we end our merrymaking.' Messengers were sent to find Bilbo's friend, though 
line 16996=>none knew where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast. 
line 16997=>     In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly 
line 16998=>and placed himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious 
line 16999=>of the mirth and music in the hall about them.  Bilbo had not much to say of 
line 17000=>himself. When  he had left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the 
line 17001=>Road or in the country on either side;  but  somehow  he had steered all the 
line 17002=>time towards Rivendell. `I got here without  much adventure,' he  said, `and 
line 17003=>after  a rest I went on with  the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan't  
line 17004=>travel again.  Old  Balin had gone away. Then I came  back  here, and here I  
line 17005=>have been. I have done this and that. I have  written some more of my  book. 
line 17006=>And, of course, I make  up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to 
line 17007=>please  me,  I think; for, of  course,  they aren't really  good  enough for  
line 17008=>Rivendell. And I listen and  I think. Time doesn't seem to pass here: it just  
line 17009=>is. A remarkable place altogether. 
line 17010=>     `I  hear  all kinds of  news,  from  over the Mountains, and out of the 
line 17011=>South,  but  hardly  anything  from the Shire.  I heard  about  the Ring, of 
line 17012=>
line 17013=>####-course. Gandalf has been here often. Not  that he has told me a  great deal, 
line 17014=>he has become closer than ever these last few years. The D®nadan has told me 
line 17015=>more. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! It  is a pity that 
line 17016=>Gandalf did not find out more sooner. I  could  have brought  the thing here 
line 17017=>myself  long ago without  so much trouble. I have  thought several  times of 
line 17018=>going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they  would not let 
line 17019=>me: Gandalf and Elrond,  I  mean.  They seemed  to  think that the Enemy was 
line 17020=>looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught 
line 17021=>me 
line 17022=>tottering about in the Wild. 
line 17023=>     'And Gandalf said: "The Ring has passed on,  Bilbo. It would do no good 
line 17024=>to  you or to others, if you tried to meddle  with it  again." Odd  sort  of 
line 17025=>remark,  just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after  you, so I  let 
line 17026=>things be. I am frightfully glad to  see  you safe and sound.' He paused and 
line 17027=>looked at Frodo doubtfully. 
line 17028=>     `Have  you got it here?' he asked  in a whisper. `I  ca n't help feeling 
line 17029=>curious,  you know, after all I've heard. I  should very much like  just  to 
line 17030=>peep at it again.' 
line 17031=>     `Yes, I've  got  it,' answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. `It 
line 17032=>looks just the same as ever it did.' 
line 17033=>     `Well, I should just lik e to see it for a moment,' said Bilbo. 
line 17034=>     When he had dressed, Frodo found  that while he slept the Ring had been 
line 17035=>hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. 
line 17036=>Bilbo  put  out  his hand.  But Frodo  quickly drew  back the Ring.  To  his 
line 17037=>distress  and  amazement he found that he was no  longer looking at Bilbo; a  
line 17038=>shadow seemed to  have fallen between them, and through it he found  himself 
line 17039=>eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands.  
line 17040=>He felt a desire to strike him. 
line 17041=>     The music  and singing round them seemed  to falter and a silence fell. 
line 17042=>Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo's face and passed his hand across his eyes. `I  
line 17043=>understand  now,' he said. `Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have  come in 
line 17044=>for this burden: sorry about everything.  Don't adventures ever have an end?  
line 17045=>I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can't  
line 17046=>be helped. I wonder if it's any good  trying  to finish my  book? But  don't 
line 17047=>let's  worry about it now-let 's have some real News! Tell  me all about  the 
line 17048=>Shire!' 
line 17049=>     Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly  a  shred 
line 17050=>
line 17051=>####-of  memory.  The light  and music  of  Rivendell was about  him again. Bilbo 
line 17052=>smiled  and laughed happily. Every  item  of news  from the Shire that Frodo 
line 17053=>could  tell-aided and corrected now and again  by  Sam-was  of the  greatest  
line 17054=>interest to  him, from the felling of  the least tree to the  pranks of  the 
line 17055=>smallest child  in  Hobbiton. They were so deep in  the doings  of  the Four 
line 17056=>Farthings that they did not  notice  the arrival of a man clad in dark green 
line 17057=>cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile. 
line 17058=>     Suddenly  Bilbo  looked  up. 'Ah, there you are  at last,  D®nadan!' he 
line 17059=>cried. 
line 17060=>     `Strider!' said Frodo. `You seem to have a lot of names.' 
line 17061=>     `Well, Strider is one that I haven't heard before, anyway,' said Bilbo. 
line 17062=>`What do you call him that for?' 
line 17063=>     `They call me that in Bree,' said Strider laughing, 'and that is how  I 
line 17064=>was introduced to him.' 
line 17065=>     `And why do you call him D®nadan?' asked Frodo. 
line 17066=>     `The D®nadan,' said Bilbo. `He is often called that here. But I thought 
line 17067=>you  knew  enough  Elvish  at  least to  know  d®n-udan: Man  of  the  West, 
line 17068=>N®menorean. But this is not the time for lessons!' He turned to Strider. 
line 17069=>     `Where have you been, my friend? Why weren't you at the feast? The Lady 
line 17070=>Arwen was there.' 
line 17071=>     Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. `I  know,'  he said. 'But often I 
line 17072=>must put  mirth aside. Elladan  and Elrohir  have returned  out  of the Wild 
line 17073=>unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.' 
line 17074=>     `Well, my  dear fellow,' said  Bilbo, `now you've heard the news, can't  
line 17075=>you spare me  a moment?  I want your help in  something urgent.  Elrond says 
line 17076=>this song of mine is to be finished  before the end of the evening, and I am 
line 17077=>stuck. Let's go off into a corner and polish it up!' 
line 17078=>     Strider smiled. `Come then!' he said. `Let me hear it!' 
line 17079=>     Frodo  was left  to himself  for a while. for Sam had fallen asleep. He 
line 17080=>was  alone and felt rather forlorn`  although  all  about  him  the  folk of 
line 17081=>Rivendell were gathered. But  those near  him were silent,  intent upon  the 
line 17082=>music of the voices and the instruments. and they  gave no heed to  anything 
line 17083=>else. Frodo began to listen. 
line 17084=>     At first the beauty of the  melodies  and  of  the interwoven  words in 
line 17085=>elven-tongues, even though he understood  them little` held him in  a spell, 
line 17086=>as soon as  he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took  
line 17087=>shape, and  visions of  far la nds  and  bright things that he had  never yet 
line 17088=>
line 17089=>####-imagined  opened out before him;  and the firelit  hall became like a golden 
line 17090=>mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the  world. Then the 
line 17091=>enchantment  became more and more dreamlike, until  he  felt  that an endless 
line 17092=>river of  swelling gold  and  silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous 
line 17093=>for its  pattern to be comprehended;  it  became part of  the throbbing  air 
line 17094=>about him, and  it  drenched and  drowned him. Swiftly  he  sank  under  its 
line 17095=>shining weight into a deep realm of sleep. 
line 17096=>     There  he wandered long in a dream of  music  that turned  into running 
line 17097=>water, and  then suddenly into a  voice. It seemed  to be the voice of Bilbo 
line 17098=>chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words. 
line 17099=>     Edrendil was a mariner 
line 17100=>     that tarried in Arvernien; 
line 17101=>     he built a boat of timber felled 
line 17102=>     in Nimbrethil to journey in; 
line 17103=>     her sails he wove of silver fair, 
line 17104=>     of silver were her lanterns made, 
line 17105=>     her prow was fashioned like a swan, 
line 17106=>     and light upon her banners laid. 
line 17107=> 
line 17108=>     In panoply of ancient kings, 
line 17109=>     in chain‚d rings he armoured him; 
line 17110=>     his shining shield was scored with runes 
line 17111=>     to ward all wounds and harm from him; 
line 17112=>     his bow was made of dragon-horn, 
line 17113=>     his arrows shorn of ebony, 
line 17114=>     of silver was his habergeon, 
line 17115=>     his scabbard of chalcedony; 
line 17116=>     his sword of steel was valiant, 
line 17117=>     of adamant his helmet tall, 
line 17118=>     an eagle -plume upon his crest, 
line 17119=>     upon his breast an emerald. 
line 17120=> 
line 17121=>     Beneath the Moon and under star 
line 17122=>     he wandered far from northern strands, 
line 17123=>     bewildered on enchanted ways 
line 17124=>     beyond the days of mortal lands. 
line 17125=>     From gnashing of the Narrow Ice 
line 17126=>
line 17127=>####-     where shadow lies on frozen hills, 
line 17128=>     from nether heats and burning waste  
line 17129=>     he turned in haste, and roving still 
line 17130=>     on starless waters far astray 
line 17131=>     at last he came to Night of Naught, 
line 17132=>     and passed, and never sight he saw 
line 17133=>     of shining shore nor light he sought. 
line 17134=> 
line 17135=>     The winds of wrath came driving him, 
line 17136=>     and blindly in the foam he fled 
line 17137=>     from west to east and errandless, 
line 17138=>     unheralded he homeward sped. 
line 17139=> 
line 17140=>     There flying Elwing came to him, 
line 17141=>     and flame was in the darkness lit; 
line 17142=>     more bright than light of diamond 
line 17143=>     the fire upon her carcanet. 
line 17144=>     The Silmaril she bound on him 
line 17145=>     and crowned him with the living light 
line 17146=>     and dauntless then with burning brow 
line 17147=>     he turned his prow; and in the night 
line 17148=>     from Otherworld beyond the Sea 
line 17149=>     there strong and free a storm arose, 
line 17150=>     a wind of power in Tarmenel; 
line 17151=>     by paths that seldom mortal goes 
line 17152=>     his boat it bore with biting breath  
line 17153=>     as might of death across the grey 
line 17154=>     and long-forsaken seas distressed: 
line 17155=>     from east to west he passed away. 
line 17156=> 
line 17157=>     Through Evernight he back was borne 
line 17158=>     on black and roaring wa ves that ran 
line 17159=>     o'er leagues unlit and foundered shores 
line 17160=>     that drowned before the Days began, 
line 17161=>     until he heard on strands of pearl 
line 17162=>     when ends the world the music long, 
line 17163=>     where ever foaming billows roll 
line 17164=>
line 17165=>####-     the yellow gold and jewels wan. 
line 17166=>     He saw the Mountain silent rise 
line 17167=>     where twilight lies upon the knees 
line 17168=>     of Valinor, and Eldamar 
line 17169=>     beheld afar beyond the seas. 
line 17170=>     A wanderer escaped from night 
line 17171=>     to haven white he came at last, 
line 17172=>     to Elvenhome the green and fair 
line 17173=>     where keen the air, where pale as glass 
line 17174=>     beneath the Hill of Ilmarin  
line 17175=>     a-glimmer in a valley sheer 
line 17176=>     the lamplit towers of Tirion 
line 17177=>     are mirrored on the Shadowmere. 
line 17178=> 
line 17179=>     He tarried there from errantry, 
line 17180=>     and melodies they taught to him, 
line 17181=>     and sages old him marvels told, 
line 17182=>     and harps of gold they brought to him. 
line 17183=>     They clothed him then in elven-white, 
line 17184=>     and seven lights before him sent, 
line 17185=>     as through the Calacirian 
line 17186=>     to hidden land forlorn he went. 
line 17187=>     He came unto the timeless halls 
line 17188=>     where shining fall the countless years, 
line 17189=>     and endless reigns the Elder King 
line 17190=>     in Ilmarin on Mountain sheer; 
line 17191=>     and words unheard were spoken then 
line 17192=>     of folk of Men and Elven-kin, 
line 17193=>     beyond the world were visions showed 
line 17194=>     forbid to those that dwell therein. 
line 17195=> 
line 17196=>     A ship then new they built for him 
line 17197=>     of mithril and of elven-glass 
line 17198=>     with shining prow; no shaven oar 
line 17199=>     nor sail she bore on silver mast: 
line 17200=>     the Silmaril as lantern light 
line 17201=>     and banner bright with living flame 
line 17202=>
line 17203=>####-     to gleam thereon by Elbereth  
line 17204=>     herself was set, who thither came 
line 17205=>     and wings immortal made for him, 
line 17206=>     and laid on him undying doom, 
line 17207=>     to sail the shoreless skies and come 
line 17208=>     behind the Sun and light of Moon. 
line 17209=> 
line 17210=>     From Evereven's lofty hills 
line 17211=>     where softly silver fountains fall 
line 17212=>     his wings him bore, a wandering light, 
line 17213=>     beyond the mighty Mountain Wall. 
line 17214=>     From World's End then he turned away 
line 17215=>     and yearned again to find afar 
line 17216=>     his home through shadows journeying, 
line 17217=>     and burning as an island star 
line 17218=>     on high above the mists he came, 
line 17219=>     a distant flame before the Sun, 
line 17220=>     a wonder ere the waking dawn  
line 17221=>     where grey the Norland waters run. 
line 17222=> 
line 17223=>     And over Middle -earth he passed 
line 17224=>     and heard at last the weeping sore 
line 17225=>     of women and of elven-maids 
line 17226=>     in Elder Days, in years of yore. 
line 17227=>     gut on him mighty doom was laid, 
line 17228=>     till Moon should fade, an orb‚d star 
line 17229=>     to pass, and tarry never more 
line 17230=>     on Hither Shores where mortals are; 
line 17231=>     for ever still a herald on 
line 17232=>     an errand that should never rest 
line 17233=>     to bear his shining lamp afar, 
line 17234=>     the Flammifer of Westernesse. 
line 17235=>     The  chanting  ceased. Frodo opened his eyes  and  saw  that Bilbo  was 
line 17236=>seated  on  his  stool  in  a  circle  of listeners,  who  were smiling   and 
line 17237=>applauding. 
line 17238=>     `Now we had better have it again,' said an Elf. 
line 17239=>     Bilbo got up  and bowed.  `I am  flattered, Lindir,'  he said. 'But  it 
line 17240=>
line 17241=>####-would be too tiring to repeat it all.' 
line 17242=>     'Not too  tiring  for you,' the Elves answered laughing.  'You k now you  
line 17243=>are never tired  of reciting  your own verses.  But really  we cannot answer  
line 17244=>your question at one hearing!' 
line 17245=>     `What!' cried Bilbo. 'You can't tell which parts were  mine,  and which 
line 17246=>were the D®nadan's?' 
line 17247=>     'It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals' said 
line 17248=>the Elf.  
line 17249=>     'Nonsense, Lindir,'  snorted Bilbo. 'If you can't distinguish between a  
line 17250=>Man  and a Hobbit,  your  judgement is  poorer than  I  imagined. They're as 
line 17251=>different as peas and apples.' 
line 17252=>     'Maybe.  To  sheep  other sheep no  doubt  appear  different,'  laughed 
line 17253=>Lindir. `Or to shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other  
line 17254=>business.' 
line 17255=>     'I won't  argue with you,' said Bilbo. 'I am sleepy after so much music 
line 17256=>and singing. I'll leave you to guess, if  you want to.' 
line 17257=>     He got up and came towards Frodo. 'Well, that's over,' he said in a low 
line 17258=>voice. `It went off  better than  I expected. I don't often get asked for  a  
line 17259=>second hearing. What did you think of it?' 
line 17260=>     `I am not going to try and guess,' said Frodo smiling. 
line 17261=>     `You needn't,' said Bilbo. `As a matter of fact it was all mine. Except 
line 17262=>that Aragorn insisted  on my putting in a green stone. He seemed to think it 
line 17263=>important. I don't know  why. Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing 
line 17264=>rather above my head, and  he  said that if I had  the cheek to make  verses 
line 17265=>about  Edrendil in the house  of  Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose he was 
line 17266=>right.' 
line 17267=>     'I don't know,' said Frodo. `It seemed to  me  to fit somehow, though I 
line 17268=>can't explain. I was half asleep when you began,  and it seemed to follow on  
line 17269=>from  something that I  was dreaming about.  I didn't understand that it was 
line 17270=>really you speaking until near the end.' 
line 17271=>     `It  is  difficult to  keep awake here, until you get used to it;'  said 
line 17272=>Bilbo.  'Not that hobbits  would ever acquire quite  the elvish appetite for  
line 17273=>music and poetry and tales. They seem to like them as much as food, or more. 
line 17274=>They will be going on  for a long time yet. What  do you say to slipping off 
line 17275=>for some more quiet talk?' 
line 17276=>     `Can we?' said Frodo. 
line 17277=>     `Of course. This is merrymaking not business.  Come and go as you like,  
line 17278=>
line 17279=>####-as long as you don't make a noise.' 
line 17280=>     They  got  up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made  for  the 
line 17281=>doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a  smile on his face. In 
line 17282=>spite of his delight in  Bilbo's company Frodo felt a tug of  regret as they 
line 17283=>passed  out of the Hall of Fire.  Even as they  stepped over the threshold a  
line 17284=>single clear voice rose in song. 
line 17285=>     A Elbereth Gilthoniel, 
line 17286=>     silivren penna mnriel 
line 17287=>     o menel aglar elenath! 
line 17288=>     Na-chaered palan -dnriel 
line 17289=>     o galadhremmin ennorath, 
line 17290=>     Fanuilos, le linnathon 
line 17291=>     nef aear, sn nef aearon! 
line 17292=>     Frodo halted  for a moment,  looking back. Elrond was in his  chair and 
line 17293=>the  fire was on his face like summer -light upon the trees. Near him sat the 
line 17294=>Lady Arwen. To  his surprise  Frodo saw that Aragorn stood  beside  her; his 
line 17295=>dark cloak was thrown back, and he seemed  to be  clad  in elven-mail, and a  
line 17296=>star shone  on his breast.  They spoke together, and then suddenly it seemed  
line 17297=>to Frodo that Arwen  turned towards him, and the light of  her eyes  fell on 
line 17298=>him from afar and pierced his heart. 
line 17299=>     He  stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song 
line 17300=>fell like  clear  jewels  of blended  word  and melody. `It  is  a  song  to 
line 17301=>Elbereth,' said Bilbo. `They will sing that, and other songs of the  Blessed 
line 17302=>Realm, many times tonight. Come on!' 
line 17303=>     He led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the  gar dens 
line 17304=>and looked  south across the ravine  of the Bruinen. There they sat for some  
line 17305=>while,  looking  through  the   window   at  the  bright  stars  above   the 
line 17306=>steep-climbing  woods, and  talking softly. They  spoke no more of the small 
line 17307=>news of  the  Shire far  away, nor  of  the dark  shadows  and  perils  that 
line 17308=>encompassed  them,  but  of  the  fair  things  they  had seen in the  world 
line 17309=>together,  of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the  gentle fall of the 
line 17310=>bright year in the woods.  
line 17311=>     At last there came  a knock  on the door. `Begging  your pardon,'  said 
line 17312=>Sam,  putting in his head, `but I was just wondering if you would be wanting  
line 17313=>anything.' 
line 17314=>     `And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,' replied  Bilbo. `I guess you mean that 
line 17315=>it is time your master went to bed.' 
line 17316=>
line 17317=>####-     `Well, sir,  there is a  Council early tomorrow, I hear and he only got 
line 17318=>up today for the first time.' 
line 17319=>     `Quite right, Sam,'  laughed Bilbo. `You can  trot off and tell Gandalf 
line 17320=>that he  has gone to bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me, but it  has been good  
line 17321=>to see you again! There are no folk like  hobbits  after all for a real good 
line 17322=>talk. I am getting very  old, and I began to wonder if I should ever live to 
line 17323=>see your chapters of  our story. Good night! I'll take a walk, I  think, and 
line 17324=>look at the stars of Elbereth in the garden. Sleep well!' 
line 17325=> 
line 17326=>
line 17327=>####- 
line 17328=>
line 17329=>Chapter 2. The Council of Elrond 
line 17330=>
line 17331=> 
line 17332=> 
line 17333=>     Next day Frodo woke  early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along  
line 17334=>the terraces above  the  loud-flowing Bruinen and watched the pale, cool sun 
line 17335=>rise  above the far  mountains, and shine  down. Slanting  through the  thin 
line 17336=>silver mist;  the dew upon the  yellow leaves was glimmering, and  the woven 
line 17337=>nets of  gossamer twinkled  on  every bush.  Sam  walked beside  him, saying 
line 17338=>nothing.  but  sniffing the air, and looking every now and again with wonder  
line 17339=>in his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon  their 
line 17340=>peaks. 
line 17341=>     On a seat cut  in  the  stone beside  a turn in the path they came upon 
line 17342=>Gandalf and  Bilbo  deep in  talk. `Hullo!  Good morning!' said Bilbo. `Feel  
line 17343=>ready for the  great council?' 
line 17344=>     `I feel ready  for anything,' answered Frodo. `But most of all I should 
line 17345=>like to go walking  today and  explore the valley. I should like to get into 
line 17346=>those pine-woods up there.' He pointed away far up the side of  Rivendell to  
line 17347=>the north. 
line 17348=>     'You may  have  a chance later,' said Gandalf. `But we cannot  make any 
line 17349=>plans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.' 
line 17350=>     Suddenly as they were talking a  single clear bell rang out.  `That  is 
line 17351=>the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,' cr ied Gandalf. `Come along now! 
line 17352=>Both you and Bilbo are wanted.' 
line 17353=>     Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back 
line 17354=>to the  house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgotten,  trotted 
line 17355=>Sam. 
line 17356=>     Gandalf  led them to the porch where  Frodo had found  his  friends the 
line 17357=>evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning was now glowing in the 
line 17358=>valley. The noise of bubbling  waters  came up  from the foaming  river -bed. 
line 17359=>Birds were singing,  and a  wholesome  peace lay on the  land. To  Frodo his 
line 17360=>dangerous flight, and  the rumours  of  the darkness growing  in  the  world 
line 17361=>outside, already seemed only the memories of a troubled dream; but the faces 
line 17362=>that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave. 
line 17363=>     Elrond was there, and  several others were seated in silence about him. 
line 17364=>Frodo saw Glorfindel and Gluin;  and  in a corner alone Strider was sitting, 
line 17365=>clad in  his old  travel -worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat  by 
line 17366=>
line 17367=>####-his side, and presented him to the company, saying: 
line 17368=>     'Here, my friends is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come 
line 17369=>hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.' 
line 17370=>     He then  pointed  out  and named those whom Frodo  had  not met before. 
line 17371=>There was a younger dwarf at Gluin's side: his son Gimli. Beside  Glorfindel  
line 17372=>there were several other counsellors of Elrond's household, of  whom Erestor 
line 17373=>was the chief; and with him was Galdor, an Elf  from the Grey Havens who had 
line 17374=>come on an errand from Cnrdan the Shipwright. There  was also a  strange Elf 
line 17375=>clad in green  and  brown,  Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil,  
line 17376=>the King of the  Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And seated a little apart was a  
line 17377=>tall man with a fair and  noble face,  dark-haired and  grey-eyed, proud and 
line 17378=>stern of glance. 
line 17379=>     He was cloaked and booted as if for a  journey on horseback; and indeed  
line 17380=>though his garments were rich,  and his cloak was lined with  fur, they were 
line 17381=>stained with long travel. He had a  collar of silver in which a single white 
line 17382=>stone was set; his locks  were shorn about his shoulders.  On a  baldric  he 
line 17383=>wore  a  great horn tipped with  silver that now was laid upon his knees. He 
line 17384=>gazed at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder. 
line 17385=>     `Here,' said Elrond,  turning  to Gandalf, `is Boromir, a man  from the 
line 17386=>South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for counsel. I  have bidden 
line 17387=>him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.' 
line 17388=>     Not all that was  spoken and debated in the  Council need now  be told. 
line 17389=>Much was said of events in  the  world outside, especially in the South, and 
line 17390=>in  the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo  had already  
line 17391=>heard many rumours; but the tale of Gluin was new to him, and when the dwarf 
line 17392=>spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour  of their 
line 17393=>works  of  hand  the  hearts of  the  Dwarves of  the  Lonely Mountain  were 
line 17394=>troubled. 
line 17395=>     `It is now many years ago,' said Gluin, `that a shadow of disquiet fell 
line 17396=>upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first perceive. Words began to 
line 17397=>be whispered in secret-: it was said that we were hemmed in  a narrow place, 
line 17398=>and  that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some 
line 17399=>spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers  that are called in  our own 
line 17400=>tongue Khazad-dym; and they  declared that now at last  we had the power and 
line 17401=>numbers to return.' 
line 17402=>     Gluin  sighed. `Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we 
line 17403=>delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long  have  its vast mansions lain 
line 17404=>
line 17405=>####-empty since the  children of Durin fled. But now we  spoke of  it again with  
line 17406=>longing, and yet with  dread;  for  no dwarf has dared to pass  the doors of 
line 17407=>Khazad-dym  for many  lives of kings, save Thrur only, and  he  perished. At 
line 17408=>last, however,  Balin  listened to  the whispers,  and resolved   to  go; and 
line 17409=>though Dbin did not  give leave willingly, he took with him  Ori and Uin and 
line 17410=>many of our folk, and they went away south. 
line 17411=>     "That  was  nigh  on thirty  years ago. For a while we had  news and it 
line 17412=>seemed good: messages reported that Moria ha d been entered and a great  work 
line 17413=>begun there.  Then there was silence,  and  no word has ever come from Moria  
line 17414=>since. 
line 17415=>     "Then  about  a  year  ago  a  messenger came  to Dbin,  but  not  from 
line 17416=>Moria -from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dbin to his gate. The 
line 17417=>Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would 
line 17418=>give for  it, such  as he gave  of  old.  And he  asked urgently  concerning 
line 17419=>hobbits, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt.  "For Sauron  knows," 
line 17420=>said he, "that one of these was known to you on a time." 
line 17421=>     'At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And  then his 
line 17422=>fell  voice was lowered,  and he  would have sweetened it if he could. "As a  
line 17423=>small token only of your friendship  Sauron asks this,"  he  said: "that you  
line 17424=>should find this thief," such  was  his word, "and get from him, willing  or  
line 17425=>no, a  little  ring, the least of  rings,  that  once he stole. It  is but a  
line 17426=>trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good  will.  Find it, and 
line 17427=>three rings that the Dwarf sires possessed of old shall be  returned to you, 
line 17428=>and the realm of Moria shall be yours for ever. Find only news of the thief,  
line 17429=>whether  he  still lives  and where,  and you  shall  have great  reward and 
line 17430=>lasting friendship from the Lord. Refuse,  and things will not seem so well. 
line 17431=>Do you refuse?" 
line 17432=>     'At that his breath came like  the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by 
line 17433=>shuddered, but  Dbin said: "I say neither yea nor  nay. I must consider this 
line 17434=>message and what it means under its fair cloak." 
line 17435=>     ' "Consider well, but not too long," said he. 
line 17436=>     ` "The time of my thought is my own to spend," answered Dbin. 
line 17437=>     ' "For the present," said he, and rode into the darkness.  
line 17438=>     'Heavy have the  hearts  of our  chieftains  been since that  night. We 
line 17439=>needed not the fell voice of  the messenger to  warn us that his  words held 
line 17440=>both  menace  and  deceit; for  we knew  already that  the  power  that  has 
line 17441=>re-entered Mordor has not changed, and ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the 
line 17442=>
line 17443=>####-messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so 
line 17444=>he says, is soon to come, before the ending of the year. 
line 17445=>     'And so I  have been  sent at last by Dbin  to warn  Bilbo  that  he is 
line 17446=>sought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this ring, this 
line 17447=>least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and 
line 17448=>draws nearer.  We discover that messengers  have come also to King  Brand in 
line 17449=>Dale,  and  that he is  afraid. We  fear  that he may yield. Already war  is 
line 17450=>gathering on  his eastern borders.  If we make no answer, the Enemy may move 
line 17451=>Men of his rule to assail King Brand, and Dbin also.' 
line 17452=>     `You  have done well to come,' said Elrond.  `You will  hear today  all 
line 17453=>that you need in order to  understand  the purposes of the  Enemy. There  is 
line 17454=>naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without  it.  But 
line 17455=>you do not stand alone. You will learn that your  trouble is but part of the 
line 17456=>trouble of all the western world. The Ring! What shall we do  with the Ring, 
line 17457=>the least of rings, the trifle that Sauron fancies? That is the doom that we 
line 17458=>must deem. 
line 17459=>     `That is the  purpose for which you are  called hither. Called, I  say. 
line 17460=>though  I have not called you to me, strangers from distant lands. You  have 
line 17461=>come and are here met, in this very nick  of time, by chance as it may seem.  
line 17462=>Yet it  is not so. Believe rather that it is  so ordered  that  we, who  sit 
line 17463=>here, and none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world. 
line 17464=>     `Now, therefore, things  shall be  openly spoken that  have been hidden 
line 17465=>from all  but a few  until this  day. And first, so that all  may understand 
line 17466=>what is the  peril, the  Tale  of the Ring shall be told  from the beginning 
line 17467=>even  to this present.  And I will begin that tale, though others  shall end 
line 17468=>it.' 
line 17469=>     Then all listened while  Elrond in his clear voice  spoke of Sauron and 
line 17470=>the Rings of Power,  and  their forging in the  Second Age of the world long 
line 17471=>ago. A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full  tale to none, 
line 17472=>and  many eyes were turned  t= Elrond in  fear and wonder as he  told of the 
line 17473=>Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness 
line 17474=>for knowledge,  by which Sauron ensnared them. For  in that time he was  not 
line 17475=>yet evil to  behold, and they received his  aid  and  grew mighty in  craft, 
line 17476=>whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly 
line 17477=>in the Mountain of Fire the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was 
line 17478=>aware of him, and  hid the  Three which  he had made; and there was war, and 
line 17479=>the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut. 
line 17480=>
line 17481=>####-     Then through all the years that followed he  traced the Ring; but since 
line 17482=>that history is elsewhere recounted, even as Elrond  himself  set it down in 
line 17483=>his books of lore,  it is not   here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of 
line 17484=>deeds great and terrible, and briefly though Elrond spoke,  the sun rode  up 
line 17485=>the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased. 
line 17486=>     Of N®menor he spoke, its glory  and its fall,  and the  return  of  the 
line 17487=>Kings of Men to Middle-earth out  of the  deeps of  the Sea, borne  upon the 
line 17488=>wings  of storm.  Then Elendil the  Tall and  his  mighty sons,  Isildur and 
line 17489=>Anbrion, became great lords; and the North-realm they made in Arnor, and the 
line 17490=>South-realm  in  Gondor above  the mouths  of  Anduin. But Sauron of  Mordor  
line 17491=>assailed them, and they made the Last Alliance of  Elves  and  Men,  and the 
line 17492=>hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor. 
line 17493=>     Thereupon  Elrond paused a  while  and  sighed.  `I  remember  well the 
line 17494=>splendour  of  their banners,' he said.  `It recalled to me the glory of the 
line 17495=>Elder  Days  and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and  captains 
line 17496=>were  assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim  was 
line 17497=>broken, and the  Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever,  and it was  not 
line 17498=>so.' 
line 17499=>     `You  remember?'  said  Frodo,   speaking  his  thought  aloud  in  his 
line 17500=>astonishment. `But I thought,' he stammered as Elrond turned towards him, 'I 
line 17501=>thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.' 
line 17502=>     'So  it was  indeed,' answered  Elrond gravely.  `But my memory reaches 
line 17503=>back even  to the Elder Days. Edrendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin 
line 17504=>before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter  of Dior, son of L®thien 
line 17505=>of  Doriath .  I  have  seen  three ages in the West of the world,  and  many 
line 17506=>defeats, and many fruitless victories.  
line 17507=>     `I  was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the 
line 17508=>Battle  of  Dagorlad before  the  Black Gate of  Mordor,  where  we had  the 
line 17509=>mastery: for the Spear  of  Gil-galad and the  Sword of Elendil, Aiglos  and 
line 17510=>Narsil, none could  withstand.  I beheld the  last  combat  on the slopes of 
line 17511=>Orodruin, where Gil-galad  died, and  Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath  
line 17512=>him; but Sauron himself  was overthrown, and Isildur  cut the Ring  from his 
line 17513=>hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword, and took it for his own.' 
line 17514=>     At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. `So that is what became of the 
line 17515=>Ring!' he  cried. `If ever  such a  tale was told  in the South, it  has long 
line 17516=>been forgotten. I have  heard of  the Great Ring of him that we do not name;  
line 17517=>but we believed  that it  perished from the world in the  ruin of  his first  
line 17518=>
line 17519=>####-realm. Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.' 
line 17520=>     `Alas! yes,' said Elrond. `Isildur took it, as should not have been. It 
line 17521=>should have  been cast then into Orodruin's fire nigh  at hand  where it was 
line 17522=>made. But few marked what Isildur did.  He alone stood by his father in that 
line 17523=>last mortal  contest; and by Gil-galad only Cnrdan stood, and I. But Isildur 
line 17524=>would not listen to our counsel. 
line 17525=>     '  "This  I will have as weregild for  my father, and my  brother,"  he 
line 17526=>said; and  therefore whether we would or no, he took  it to treasure it. But 
line 17527=>soon he was betrayed by  it  to  his death; and so  it is named in the North 
line 17528=>Isildur's Bane. Yet death  maybe  was  better  than  what  else  might  have 
line 17529=>befallen him. 
line 17530=>     'Only to the North did  these tidings come, and  only  to a few.  Small 
line 17531=>wonder  it is that you have not heard them,  Boromir. From the  ruin  of the 
line 17532=>Gladden Fields,  where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back  over 
line 17533=>the mountains  after long wandering. One of these was  Ohtar, the esquire of 
line 17534=>Isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to 
line 17535=>Valandil, the heir of Isildur, who being  but a  child had remained  here in 
line 17536=>Rivendell.  But Narsil was broken and its light extinguished, and it has not 
line 17537=>yet been forged again. 
line 17538=>     `Fruitless did I call the victory of the Last  Alliance? Not wholly so, 
line 17539=>yet it  did not achieve  its  end. Sauron was diminished, but not destroyed. 
line 17540=>His  Ring was  lost  but  not  unmade. The Dark  Tower  was broken,  but its 
line 17541=>foundations were not removed; for they were made with the power of the Ring, 
line 17542=>and while it remains  they wi ll endure. Many Elves and many mighty Men,  
line 17543=>and 
line 17544=>many  of  their  friends. had perished  in  the war. Anbrion  was slain, and 
line 17545=>Isildur was slain; and Gil-galad and Elendil were no more. Never again shall  
line 17546=>there  be  any  such  league  of  Elves  and  Men; for  Men  multiply and the 
line 17547=>Firstborn decrease, and the two  kindreds are estranged. And ever since that 
line 17548=>day  the race  of N®menor has decayed,  and  the  span of  their  years  has 
line 17549=>lessened. 
line 17550=>     'In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the 
line 17551=>Men  of Westernesse were diminished, and their city of Ann®minas beside 
line 17552=>Lake 
line 17553=>Evendim fell  into ruin; and  the heirs  of Valandil  removed and  dwelt  at 
line 17554=>Fornost on the high North Downs, and  that now too is desolate. Men call  it  
line 17555=>Deadmen's  Dike,  and  they  fear  to  tread there.  For the  folk of  Arnor  
line 17556=>
line 17557=>####-dwindled, and their  foes devoured them, and their lordship passed,  leaving  
line 17558=>only green mounds in the grassy hills. 
line 17559=>     'In  the South  the  realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while  its 
line 17560=>splendour grew, recalling  somewhat of the might  of N®menor,  ere it  fell. 
line 17561=>High towers  that people built, and strong places. and havens of many ships;  
line 17562=>and the  winged crown of the Kings of  Men was  held in awe by folk of  many 
line 17563=>tongues. Their chief city wa s  Osgiliath, Citadel of the Stars. through  the 
line 17564=>midst of which  the River  flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower  of the  
line 17565=>Rising  Moon,  eastward  upon  a shoulder of the  Mountains  of  Shadow; and 
line 17566=>westward at the feet of the White  Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower  of 
line 17567=>the Setting Sun. There in the courts of the King grew a white tree, from the 
line 17568=>seed of that tree which Isildur  brought over the  deep waters, and the seed 
line 17569=>of that tree before came from Eressla, and before that  out of the Uttermost  
line 17570=>West in the Day before days when the world was young. 
line 17571=>     `But  in the  wearing of the  swift years  of Middle-earth the line  of 
line 17572=>Meneldil son of Anbrion failed, and the  Tree withered, and the blood of the 
line 17573=>N®menoreans became  mingled with that of lesser men. Then the watch upon 
line 17574=>the 
line 17575=>walls of  Mordor slept, and  dark  things crept back to  Gorgoroth. And on a  
line 17576=>time evil things came  forth, and they took Minas Ithil and abode in it, and 
line 17577=>they made it into a place of dread; and it is called Minas Morgul, the Tower  
line 17578=>of Sorcery. Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith, the Tower of 
line 17579=>Guard; 
line 17580=>and these two cities  were ever at war, but Osgiliath  which lay between was 
line 17581=>deserted and in its ruins shadows walked. 
line 17582=>     'So it has been  for many lives of men. But  the  Lords of Minas Tirith 
line 17583=>still  fight on, defying our enemies, keeping the passage  of the River from 
line 17584=>Argonath  to the  Sea.  And now that part of the tale that  I shall tell  is 
line 17585=>drawn to its close. For in the days of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of 
line 17586=>all knowledge, and the  Three  were  released from  its dominion. But now in 
line 17587=>this latter day they  are  in peril once more, for to our sorrow the One has 
line 17588=>been  found. Others shall speak of its finding,  for  in that I played small 
line 17589=>part.' 
line 17590=>     He ceased, but  at once Boromir  stood up, tall and proud, before them. 
line 17591=>Give  me leave, Master  Elrond, said  he, first  to  say more of Gondor; for  
line 17592=>verily from the land of Gondor I  am come. And  it would  be well for all to 
line 17593=>know what passes there. For few,  I deem, know of  our deeds, and  therefore 
line 17594=>
line 17595=>####-guess little of their peril, if we should fail at last. 
line 17596=>     `Believe  not that in the land of Gondor the blood of N®menor is spent, 
line 17597=>nor all its pride  and dignity forgotten. By our valour the wild folk of the 
line 17598=>East are still restrained,  and the terror of Morgul  kept at bay; and  thus 
line 17599=>alone are peace and freedom maintained in the lands behind  us,  bulwark  of 
line 17600=>the West. But if the passages of the River should be won, what then?  
line 17601=>     `Yet  that hour, maybe, is not now far away.  The  Nameless  Enemy  has 
line 17602=>arisen again.  Smoke  rises once more from Orodruin that we call Mount 
line 17603=>Doom. 
line 17604=>The power  of the Black  Land  grows and we are  hard beset. When the  
line 17605=>Enemy 
line 17606=>returned  our folk were driven from  Ithilien, our fair  domain east of  the 
line 17607=>River, though we kept a  foothold there and  strength of arms. But this very 
line 17608=>year,  in  the days of  June, sudden war came  upon us out of Mordor, and we 
line 17609=>were swept away. We were  outnumbered, for Mordor has allied itself with the 
line 17610=>Easterlings  and the cruel Haradrim; but it was not by numbers that we  were 
line 17611=>defeated. A power was there that we have not felt before. 
line 17612=>     `Some said  that it could be seen, like a great  black horseman, a dark 
line 17613=>shadow under the moon. Wherever he came a  madness filled our foes,  but fear 
line 17614=>fell on our boldest, so that horse and man gave way and fled. Only a remnant 
line 17615=>of our eastern force came back, destroying the last bridge that still  stood 
line 17616=>amid the ruins of Osgiliath. 
line 17617=>     'I was in  the company  that  held the  bridge, until it was cast  down 
line 17618=>behind us. Four  only were saved by swimming: my brother and myself and  
line 17619=>two 
line 17620=>others. But still we  fight on, holding all  the  west shores of Anduin; and  
line 17621=>those who shelter behind us give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much  
line 17622=>praise but little help. Only from Rohan  now will any men ride to us when we 
line 17623=>call. 
line 17624=>     `In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues 
line 17625=>to Elrond: a hundred and ten days I have journeyed all alone. But  I  do not 
line 17626=>seek allies in war. The  might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons,  it is 
line 17627=>said. I come  to ask for counsel and  the  unravelling of hard words. For on 
line 17628=>the  eve  of  the  sudden assault a dream came to  my brother in a  troubled 
line 17629=>sleep; and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again, and once to me. 
line 17630=>     'In that  dream I  thought the  eastern sky grew dark  and there  was a  
line 17631=>growing thunder, but  in  the  West a pale light lingered, and out of  it  I 
line 17632=>
line 17633=>####-heard a voice, remote but clear, crying: 
line 17634=>     Seek for the Sword that was broken: 
line 17635=>     In Imladris it dwells; 
line 17636=>     There shall be counsels taken 
line 17637=>     Stronger than Morgul-spells. 
line 17638=>     There shall be shown a token 
line 17639=>     That Doom is near at hand, 
line 17640=>     For Isildur's Bane shall waken, 
line 17641=>     And the Halfling forth shall stand. 
line 17642=>     Of these words we could understand little, and we  spoke to our father, 
line 17643=>Denethor, Lord of Minas Tirith, wise in the lore of  Gondor. This only would 
line 17644=>he say, that Imladris was  of old the name among the Elves of a far northern 
line 17645=>dale, where Elrond the Halfelven dwelt, g reatest  of lore-masters. Therefore 
line 17646=>my  brother, seeing how desperate  was our need, was eager to heed the dream 
line 17647=>and seek for  Imladris; but since the  way was full  of doubt and  danger, I 
line 17648=>took the journey upon  myself. Loth was my father to give me leave, and long 
line 17649=>have I  wandered  by roads forgotten, seeking the house of Elrond, of  which  
line 17650=>many had heard, but few knew where it lay.' 
line 17651=>     'And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you'  said 
line 17652=>Aragorn,  standing up. He cast  his sword upon  the  table  that stood before 
line 17653=>Elrond,  and  the blade  was in  two  pieces.  `Here  is  the Sword that was 
line 17654=>Broken!' he said. 
line 17655=>     `And  who  are you, and what have  you to do with  Minas Tirith?' asked 
line 17656=>Boromir,  looking  in  wonder  at  the  lean face  of   the  Ranger  and  his 
line 17657=>weather-stained cloak. 
line 17658=>     `He is Aragorn  son of Arathorn,'  said Elrond;  `and  he is  descended 
line 17659=>through many fathers from Isildur Elendil's son of  Minas  Ithil. He  is the 
line 17660=>Chief of the D®nedain in the North, and few are now left  of that folk.' 
line 17661=>     `Then  it  belongs to  you,  and not to  me  at all!'  cried  Frodo  in 
line 17662=>amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected  the Ring to be demanded 
line 17663=>at once. 
line 17664=>     'It does not belong  to either of us,'  said Aragorn; `but it has  been 
line 17665=>ordained that you should hold it for a while.' 
line 17666=>     'Bring out the Ring, Frodo!' said Gandalf solemnly. `The time has come. 
line 17667=>Hold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle.' 
line 17668=>     There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was shaken  by 
line 17669=>a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to  reveal the Ring, 
line 17670=>
line 17671=>####-and a loathing of its touch. He wished he was far away. The Ring gleamed and 
line 17672=>flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand. 
line 17673=>     'Behold Isildur's Bane!' said Elrond. 
line 17674=>     Boromir's eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. `The Halfling!' 
line 17675=>he  muttered.  `Is then the  doom of Minas Tirith come at last? But why then 
line 17676=>should we seek a broken sword?' 
line 17677=>     'The words were not the  doom of Minas Tir ith,' said Aragorn. `But doom 
line 17678=>and great  deeds are indeed at hand.  For the  Sword that  was Broken is the 
line 17679=>Sword of Elendil that broke beneath him when  he fell. It has been treasured 
line 17680=>by  his  heirs when all other heirlooms  were lost; for it was spoken of old 
line 17681=>among  us that it should be made  again when the  Ring, Isildur's  Bane, was 
line 17682=>found. Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you 
line 17683=>ask? 
line 17684=>Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?' 
line 17685=>     `I was  not  sent to beg  any boon, but to  seek only the meaning  of a  
line 17686=>riddle,' answered Boromir proudly. `Yet we are hard  pressed, and  the Sword 
line 17687=>of  Elendil would be a help beyond  our hope-if  such a  thing could  indeed 
line 17688=>return out of  the  shadows  of  the past.' He look ed again  at Aragorn, and 
line 17689=>doubt was in his eyes. 
line 17690=>     Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed 
line 17691=>on his friend's behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst out: 
line 17692=>     All that is gold does not glitter, 
line 17693=>     Not all those who wander are lost; 
line 17694=>     The old that is strong does not wither, 
line 17695=>     Deep roots are not reached by the frost. 
line 17696=> 
line 17697=>     From the ashes a fire shall be woken, 
line 17698=>     A light from the shadows shall spring; 
line 17699=>     Renewed shall be blade that was broken: 
line 17700=>     The crownless again shall be king. 
line 17701=>     `Not very good perhaps, but to the point  -- if you need more beyond the 
line 17702=>word  of Elrond. If that  was worth a journey of a hundred  and ten days  to 
line 17703=>hear, you had best listen to it.' He sat down with a snort. 
line 17704=>     `I  made  that  up myself,' he whispered to Frodo, `for the  D®nadan, a  
line 17705=>long  time  ago when  he first told me about  himself. I almost wish that my 
line 17706=>adventures were not over, and that I could go with him when his day comes.' 
line 17707=>     Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again. `For my part  I 
line 17708=>
line 17709=>####-forgive your doubt,'  he said. 'Little do I resemble the figures  of Elendil 
line 17710=>and Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in  the halls of Denethor. 
line 17711=>I  am but the heir of Isildur, not Isildur himself. I  have had  a hard life 
line 17712=>and a long; and  the  leagues that lie between here and  Gondor are a  small 
line 17713=>part  in the count of my journeys.  I have crossed many mountains  and  many 
line 17714=>rivers, and trodden  many  plains, even  into the far  countries of Rhyn and 
line 17715=>Harad where the stars are strange. 
line 17716=>     'But my home, such  as I have, is in the  North. For  here the heirs of 
line 17717=>Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many 
line 17718=>generations.  Our days have darkened,  and  we  have dwindled; but ever  the 
line 17719=>Sword has passed to a new keeper. And this I will say to you, Boromir, ere I  
line 17720=>end.  Lonely  men are we, Rangers of  the wild, hunters--but hunters ever of 
line 17721=>the servants  of the Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor 
line 17722=>only. 
line 17723=>     `If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we  have played another  
line 17724=>part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls and bright swords do 
line 17725=>not  stay. You  know  little  of the  lands beyond  your  bounds.  Peace and 
line 17726=>freedom, do you say? The North would have known them little but for us. Fear 
line 17727=>would  have destroyed them.  But when dark  things come  from the  houseless 
line 17728=>hills, or creep from sunless  woods,  they fly from us. What roads would any 
line 17729=>dare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands, or in the homes of 
line 17730=>simple men at night, if the D®nedain were asleep, or were all gone into  the 
line 17731=>grave?  
line 17732=>     `And yet less  thanks  have  we than you. Travellers  scowl at  us, and 
line 17733=>countrymen give us  scornful names. "Strider"  I am to one fat man who lives 
line 17734=>within a day's march  of foes that would  freeze his heart or lay his little 
line 17735=>town in ruin, if he were not guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would  not have  it 
line 17736=>otherwise. If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple  they will be, 
line 17737=>and we must be secret to keep them so. That has been the task of my kindred, 
line 17738=>while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown. 
line 17739=>     `But now  the world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur's 
line 17740=>Bane is found. Battle is at hand. The Sword  shall be reforged. I  will come 
line 17741=>to Minas Tirith.' 
line 17742=>     `Isildur's Bane is found, you say,' said Boromir. `I have seen a bright 
line 17743=>ring in the Halfling's hand; but Isildur perished ere this  age of the world 
line 17744=>began, they say. How do  the Wise know that this ring is his? And how has it 
line 17745=>passed  down  the  years,  until  it  is  brought  hither  by so  strange  a  
line 17746=>
line 17747=>####-messenger?' 
line 17748=>     `That shall be told,' said Elrond. 
line 17749=>     `But not  yet, I beg, Master!' said Bilbo. `Already the Sun is climbing 
line 17750=>to noon, and I feel the need of something to strengthen me.' 
line 17751=>     `I  had  not named you,' said Elrond  smiling. `But I do so now.  Come!  
line 17752=>Tell us your tale. And if you have  not yet cast your story  into verse, you  
line 17753=>may tell it in plain words. The briefer, the sooner shall you be refreshed.' 
line 17754=>     `Very well,' said Bilbo. `I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the 
line 17755=>true story, and  if some here have heard  me tell it otherwise'  -- he looked 
line 17756=>sidelong at Gluin -- `I ask them to forget it  and forgive me. I only wished 
line 17757=>to claim the treasure  as my very own  in those days, and to be rid  of  the 
line 17758=>name of thief that was put on me. But  perhaps I understand things a  little 
line 17759=>better now. Anyway, this is what happened.' 
line 17760=>     To  some there  Bilbo's tale was  wholly  new, and they  listened  with 
line 17761=>amazement while  the old  hobbit, actually not  at all displeased, recounted 
line 17762=>his  adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. 
line 17763=>He would have given also  an account of his party and disappearance from the 
line 17764=>Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand. 
line 17765=>     'Well told, my friend,' he said, `but that  is enough at this time. For  
line 17766=>the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed to Frodo, your heir. Let  
line 17767=>him now speak!' 
line 17768=>     Then, less willingly  than Bilbo, Frodo  told of all his  dealings with 
line 17769=>the  Ring from the day that  it passed  into his keeping. Every step  of his 
line 17770=>journey from Hobbiton to the Ford  of Bruinen was questioned and considered, 
line 17771=>and  everything  that  he  could  recall  concerning  the  Black Riders  was 
line 17772=>examined. At last he sat down again. 
line 17773=>     `Not bad,' Bilbo said to him. `You  would have made a good story of it, 
line 17774=>if they hadn't kept  on interrupting. I tried to  make  a few notes,  but we 
line 17775=>shall have to  go  over it all again together some time, if I am to write it 
line 17776=>up. There are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got here!' 
line 17777=>     `Yes, it made quite a long tale,' answered Frodo. 'But  the story still 
line 17778=>does not seem complete to  me.  I still want to know a good deal, especially 
line 17779=>about Gandalf.' 
line 17780=>     Galdor of the Havens, who sat near by, overheard him. `You speak for me 
line 17781=>also,'  he cried, and  turning  to  Elrond he  said: `The Wise may have good 
line 17782=>reason to believe that the halfling's trove is indeed the Great Ring of long 
line 17783=>debate, unlikely though that may seem to those who know less. But may we not 
line 17784=>
line 17785=>####-hear  the proofs? And I would ask this  also. What of Saruman? He is learned 
line 17786=>in  the lore of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he 
line 17787=>knows the things that we have heard?' 
line 17788=>     `The  questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,' said Elrond. 
line 17789=>`I had not  overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it 
line 17790=>is the part of Gandalf to make clear;  and I call upon  him last, for it  is 
line 17791=>the place of honour, and in all this matter he has been the chief.' 
line 17792=>     `Some,  Galdor,'   said Gandalf, `would think the tidings of Gluin,  and 
line 17793=>the pursuit of  Frodo,  proof enough that the halfling's trove is a thing of 
line 17794=>great worth to  the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then? The Nine the  Nazgyl 
line 17795=>keep. The Seven are taken or destroyed.' At this Gluin stirred, but  did not 
line 17796=>speak. `The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much?  
line 17797=>     'There  is indeed  a  wide  waste of time  between  the River  and  the 
line 17798=>Mountain, between the loss and the finding. But  the gap in the knowledge of 
line 17799=>the Wise  has been  filled at  last. Yet too slowly. For  the Enemy has been 
line 17800=>close  behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this 
line 17801=>year, this very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth. 
line 17802=>     'Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the 
line 17803=>doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur,  and secretly explored his ways, and 
line 17804=>found thus that our fears  were  true:  he was none other than  Sauron,  our 
line 17805=>Enemy of  old, at  length  taking shape  and power  again.  Some,  too, will 
line 17806=>remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and 
line 17807=>for 
line 17808=>long we watched him only.  Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, 
line 17809=>and the Council put forth its strength  and  drove  the evil out of Mirkwood 
line 17810=>and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance, 
line 17811=>if chance it was. 
line 17812=>     `But we were  too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron  also had watched us,  
line 17813=>and had long prepared against our stroke, governing Mordor from afar through 
line 17814=>Minas Morgu l, where his Nine servants dwelt, until  all  was  ready. Then he  
line 17815=>gave way before us,  but  only feigned to flee,  and soon  after came to the 
line 17816=>Dark Tower and openly declared  himself. Then for the  last time the Council 
line 17817=>met; for now we learned that  he was seeking ever more eagerly for the  One. 
line 17818=>We feared then that  he had some news  of it  that we knew  nothing  of. But 
line 17819=>Saruman said nay, and repeated what  he had  said to us before: that the One 
line 17820=>would never again be found in Middle-earth. 
line 17821=>     `  "At  the worst,"  said he, "our Enemy knows that we have  it not and 
line 17822=>
line 17823=>####-that it still is  lost. But what was lost may yet be  found, he thinks. Fear 
line 17824=>not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into 
line 17825=>Anduin the Great it fell; and long ago,  while  Sauron slept, it  was rolled 
line 17826=>down the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End."' 
line 17827=>     Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of 
line 17828=>the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril of the world had so long 
line 17829=>lain hidden. He sighed. 
line 17830=>     `There  I was at fault,' he said. `I was lulled by the words of Saruman 
line 17831=>the Wise; but I should have sought for the truth sooner, and our peril would 
line 17832=>now be less.' 
line 17833=>     `We were all at  fault,' said Elrond, `and but  for your vigilance  the 
line 17834=>Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!' 
line 17835=>     `From the first my heart misgave  me,  against all reason that I knew,' 
line 17836=>said Gandalf, `and I desired  to know how this thing came to Gollum, and how 
line 17837=>long he had possessed it. So I set a wa tch for  him, guessing that he  would 
line 17838=>ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but 
line 17839=>he escaped and was not found. And then alas! I let the matter rest, watching  
line 17840=>and waiting only, as we have too often done. 
line 17841=>     `Time passed  with many cares, until my  doubts were awakened again  to 
line 17842=>sudden  fear. Whence  came the hobbit's  ring?  What,  if my  fear was true, 
line 17843=>should be  done with it? Those  things I must decide. But I spoke yet of  my  
line 17844=>dread to none, knowing the peril of an  untimely whisper, if it went astray. 
line 17845=>In all the long wars with  the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest  
line 17846=>foe. 
line 17847=>     'That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware  that  spies of many  
line 17848=>sorts, even  beasts and birds,  were gathered round the Shire, and  my  fear 
line 17849=>grew.  I called  for the help of the D®nedain, and their watch  was doubled; 
line 17850=>and I opened my heart to Aragorn, the heir of Isildur.' 
line 17851=>     `And I,' said Aragorn, `counselled that we should hunt  for Gollum. too 
line 17852=>late though it may seem. And since it seemed fit that Isildur's  heir should 
line 17853=>labour to  repair  Isildur's fault, I went  with  Gandalf  on  the  long and 
line 17854=>hopeless search.' 
line 17855=>     Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, 
line 17856=>down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences of Mordor. `There we 
line 17857=>had 
line 17858=>rumour of him, and we guess  that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but 
line 17859=>we never found him,  and  at last  I  despaired. And  then  in my despair  I 
line 17860=>
line 17861=>####-thought again of a test that might make the finding of  Gollum unneeded. The 
line 17862=>ring  itself  might  tell if it were the One.  The memory  of  words  at the 
line 17863=>Council came back to me: words of Saruman, half-heeded at the time.  I heard 
line 17864=>them now clearly in my heart. 
line 17865=>     ` "The Nine, the Seven, and the Three," he said, "had each their proper  
line 17866=>gem. Not so the  One.  It  was round  and  unadorned,  as it were one of the 
line 17867=>lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could 
line 17868=>still see and read." 
line 17869=>     `What those  marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The 
line 17870=>maker. 
line 17871=>And Saruman? But great though his lore may be,  it  must have a source. What 
line 17872=>hand  save Sauron's ever  held this  thing, ere  it was  lost?  The hand  of 
line 17873=>Isildur alone. 
line 17874=>     `With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly  to Gondor . 
line 17875=>In former days the members  of my order  had been  well received  there, but 
line 17876=>Saruman most of all. Often he had  been for long  the  guest of the Lords of 
line 17877=>the  City. Less welcome  did the Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and 
line 17878=>grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books.  
line 17879=>     ' "If indeed you look only, as  you  say, for records of  ancient days, 
line 17880=>and the beginnings of the City,  read on! " he said.  "For to me what was is 
line 17881=>less dark than what is to come, and that  is  my care.  But unless you  have 
line 17882=>more  skill even  than Saruman,  who has  studied here  long, you  will find 
line 17883=>naught that  is not  well known to  me, who am  master of  the lore of  this 
line 17884=>City." 
line 17885=>     `So said Denethor.  And yet  there lie in his  hoards many records that 
line 17886=>few  now can read,  even of  the lore-masters, for their scripts and tongues 
line 17887=>have become dark  to later  men.  And  Boromir, there lies in  Minas  Tirith 
line 17888=>still, unread, I  guess,  by  any save Saruman  and  myself since the  kings 
line 17889=>failed, a scroll  that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not  march away 
line 17890=>straight from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.' 
line 17891=>     'Some in the North, maybe,' Boromir broke in.  'All know in Gondor that 
line 17892=>he went  first  to Minas Anor and  dwelt a while  with his nephew  Meneldil, 
line 17893=>instructing him,  before he committed to him the  rule of the South Kingdom. 
line 17894=>In  that time he planted there the last sapling of  the White Tree in memory 
line 17895=>of his brother.' 
line 17896=>     `But in that time also he made this scroll,' said Gandalf;  `and that is 
line 17897=>not remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For this scroll concerns  the Ring, 
line 17898=>
line 17899=>####-and thus wrote Isildur therein: 
line 17900=>     The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but 
line 17901=>records  of  it  shall  be left  in  Gondor,  where also dwell the  heirs of 
line 17902=>Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great  matters shall grow 
line 17903=>dim. 
line 17904=>     `And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it. 
line 17905=>     It  was  hot  when  I first took it, hot as  a glede,  and my  hand was 
line 17906=>scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain  of  it. 
line 17907=>Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth  
line 17908=>neither  its  beauty nor its  shape. Already the  writing  upon it, which at 
line 17909=>first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now  only barely to be  read. 
line 17910=>It is fashioned in  an elven-script of  Eregion, for they have no letters in  
line 17911=>Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I deem it to 
line 17912=>be  a tongue of the Black Land, since  it  is foul and uncouth. What evil it  
line 17913=>saith I do  not  know; but I trace here a copy  of it,  lest it fade  beyond 
line 17914=>recall. The Ring misseth,  maybe, the heat of Sauron's hand, which was black 
line 17915=>and yet burned like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the 
line 17916=>gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed. gut  for my part I will 
line 17917=>risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It  is 
line 17918=>precious to me, though I buy it with great pain. 
line 17919=>     'When  I read these words, my quest was  ended. For  the traced writing 
line 17920=>was indeed as Isildur  guessed, in the tongue of Mordor and  the servants of 
line 17921=>the Tower. And what was said therein was already  known. For in the day that 
line 17922=>Sauron first put on  the One, Celebrimbor, maker of the  Three, was aware of 
line 17923=>him, and from afar he  heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes 
line 17924=>were revealed. 
line 17925=>     `At once  I took my leave of  Denethor, but even as  I went northwards, 
line 17926=>messages came to me out of Lurien that Aragorn had passed that way, and that 
line 17927=>he had found the creature called Gollum. Therefore I went  first to meet him 
line 17928=>and hear his tale.  Into what deadly  perils  he had  gone alone I dared not 
line 17929=>guess.' 
line 17930=>     `There is little need  to tell  of them,' said Aragorn. `If a  man must  
line 17931=>needs walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly flowers of Morgul 
line 17932=>Vale, then  perils he will have. I, too, despaired at  last,  and I began my 
line 17933=>homeward  journey.  And then, by fortune, I  came suddenly on what I sought: 
line 17934=>the marks of soft feet beside  a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and  
line 17935=>swift, and it  led  not to Mordor but  away. Along  the  skirts  of the Dead 
line 17936=>
line 17937=>####-Marshes  I followed  it,  and  then I had him.  Lurking by a  stagnant mere, 
line 17938=>peering in  the water as the dark  eve  fell, I  caught  him, Gollum. He was 
line 17939=>covered  with green slime. He will never love me, I fear; for he bit me, and 
line 17940=>I  was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks 
line 17941=>of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of  all  my journey, the road back, 
line 17942=>watching him day and night, making him walk before  me with a halter  on his 
line 17943=>neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever 
line 17944=>towards Mirkwood. I brought him there at last and gave him to the Elves, for 
line 17945=>we had agreed that this should  be  done; and I was  glad to  be  rid of his 
line 17946=>company, for he  stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but 
line 17947=>Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.' 
line 17948=>     `Yes,  long  and weary,' said Gandalf, `but not without profit. For one 
line 17949=>thing, the  tale  he told of his loss agreed  with  that which Bilbo has now 
line 17950=>told openly  for  the  first time; but  that mattered little,  since  I  had 
line 17951=>already guessed it. But I  learned then first that Gollum's ring came out of 
line 17952=>the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also  that he  had 
line 17953=>possessed  it long. Many lives of his small kind. The power of the ring  had 
line 17954=>lengthened his  years far beyond their span;  but that power only  the Great 
line 17955=>Rings wield. 
line 17956=>     `And if that is  not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other test that 
line 17957=>I spoke of. Upon this very ring  which you have here seen  held aloft, round  
line 17958=>and unadorned, the  letters that Isildur reported may  still be read, if one 
line 17959=>has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I 
line 17960=>have done, and this I have read: 
line 17961=>     Ash  nazg durbatulyk, ush  nazg  gimbatul,  ash  nazg  thrakatulyk  agh  
line 17962=>burzum-ishi krimpatul.' 
line 17963=>     The change in  the wizard's voice  was  astounding. Suddenly it  became 
line 17964=>menacing,  powerful, harsh as stone.  A  shadow seemed to pass over the high 
line 17965=>sun,  and  the porch for  a moment grew  dark. All trembled,  and the  Elves 
line 17966=>stopped their ears. 
line 17967=>     `Never before has any voice dared to utter the  words of that tongue in 
line 17968=>Imladris,  Gandalf  the Grey,'  said  Elrond, as  the shadow passed  and the 
line 17969=>company breathed once more. 
line 17970=>     `And let us  hope that none  will  ever speak it  here again,' answered 
line 17971=>Gandalf. `Nonetheless I do not ask  your  pardon, Master Elrond. For if that 
line 17972=>tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West , then let all put 
line 17973=>doubt aside  that  this thing is  indeed what the Wise  have  declared:  the 
line 17974=>
line 17975=>####-treasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice;  and  in it lies a great 
line 17976=>part of his strength  of old. Out of the Black Years come the words that the 
line 17977=>Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been betrayed: 
line 17978=>     One Ring to  rule them all,  One  Ring to find  them, One Ring to bring 
line 17979=>them all and in the Darkness bind them. 
line 17980=>     `Know  also, my  friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum.  He  was 
line 17981=>loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it  is beyond all doubt  that he 
line 17982=>went to Mordor, and  there all  that  he knew was forced from him. Thus  the  
line 17983=>Enemy knows now that the  One is found,  that it was  long in the Shire; and 
line 17984=>since his servants have pursued it  almost to our  door, he  soon will know, 
line 17985=>already he may know, even as I speak, that we have it here.' 
line 17986=>     All sat silent for a  while,  until  at length Boromir  spoke. `He is a  
line 17987=>small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in mischief. What became 
line 17988=>of him? To what doom did you put him?' 
line 17989=>     'He is in prison, but no worse,' said  Aragorn.  `He had suffered much. 
line 17990=>There is no doubt that he  was tormented, and the fear of Sauron  lies black  
line 17991=>on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful 
line 17992=>Elves of Mirkwood. His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be 
line 17993=>believed in one so lean and withered.  He could work much mischief still, if 
line 17994=>he were free. And I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some 
line 17995=>evil errand.' 
line 17996=>     `Alas!  alas!' cried Legolas,  and in  his  fair  elvish face there was 
line 17997=>great distress. `The tidings that I was sent to bring must now be told. They 
line 17998=>are not  good, but only  here have I learned  how evil they may seem to this 
line 17999=>company. Smjagol, who is now called Gollum, has escaped.' 
line 18000=>     'Escaped?' cried Aragorn. 'That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it 
line 18001=>bitterly, I fear. How came the folk of Thranduil to fail in their trust?' 
line 18002=>     `Not through lack of  watchfulness,' said Legolas; `but perhaps through 
line 18003=>over -kindliness. And we fear that the prisoner had aid from others, and that 
line 18004=>more is known of our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day 
line 18005=>and  night, at Gandalf's  bidding,  much  though we wearied of the task. But 
line 18006=>Gandalf  bade us  hope still for his cure, and we had not the  heart to keep  
line 18007=>him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall  back into his old 
line 18008=>black thoughts.' 
line 18009=>     'You were less tender  to me,'  said Gluin with  a flash of his eyes as 
line 18010=>old memories were stirred  of  his imprisonment in  the  deep places of  the 
line 18011=>Elven-king's halls. 
line 18012=>
line 18013=>####-     'Now  come!' said Gandalf. `Pray do not interrupt, my good Gluin.  That 
line 18014=>was  a regrettable misunderstanding,  long set right. If  all the grievances 
line 18015=>that stand between Elves and  Dwarves are to  be brought up  here, we may as 
line 18016=>well abandon this Council.' 
line 18017=>     Gluin  rose and bowed, and Legolas  continued.  'In  the days  of  fair 
line 18018=>weather we led Gollum through the  woods; and there was a high tree standing 
line 18019=>alone far from the others which he liked to climb. Often we let him mount up 
line 18020=>to the highest branches, until he felt the free  wind; but we set a guard at 
line 18021=>the tree's foot. One day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind 
line 18022=>to climb  after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his 
line 18023=>feet as well as with his hands; so they sat by the tree far into the night. 
line 18024=>     'It was that very night of summer, yet moonless and starless, that Orcs 
line 18025=>came  on us at unawares. We drove them off after  some time;  they were many 
line 18026=>and  fierce, but they came from over  the mountains, and were unused  to the  
line 18027=>woods. When the battle was  over, we  found  that Gollum was  gone, and  his 
line 18028=>guards were slain  or taken. It then seemed plain to  us that the attack had 
line 18029=>been made for his rescue, and that he knew  of  it beforehand. How that  was 
line 18030=>contrived we cannot guess; but Gollum is cunning, and the spies of the Enemy 
line 18031=>are many. The dark things that were driven  out in  the year of the Dragon's 
line 18032=>fall have returned in greater  numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil place,  
line 18033=>save where our realm is maintained. 
line 18034=>     `We have failed to  recapture Gollum.  We came on his trail among those 
line 18035=>of many Orcs, and it plunged deep into the Forest, going south. But ere long 
line 18036=>it escaped our  skill,  and  we  dared not  continue the hunt;  for we  were 
line 18037=>drawing nigh to Dol Guldur,  and that  is still a very evil place; we do not 
line 18038=>go that way.' 
line 18039=>     `Well,  well, he  is gone,' said Gandalf. 'We have no time  to seek for  
line 18040=>him again.  He must do what he will. But he may play a part yet that neither  
line 18041=>he nor Sauron have foreseen. 
line 18042=>     'And now  I will answer Galdor's other questions. What of Saruman? What 
line 18043=>are his counsels to us in this need? This tale I must tell in full, for only 
line 18044=>Elrond  has heard it yet, and that in brief, but it will bear on all that we 
line 18045=>must  resolve. It is the last  chapter in the Tale of the Ring, so far as it 
line 18046=>has yet gone. 
line 18047=>     'At the  end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was  on 
line 18048=>my mind, and I rode to the southern borders of the little land; for I  had a  
line 18049=>foreboding  of some danger, still hidden  from  me but  drawing  near. There 
line 18050=>
line 18051=>####-messages reached me telling me of war and defeat in Gondor, and when I heard 
line 18052=>of the Black Shadow  a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing  save a few 
line 18053=>fugitives  from  the South;  yet  it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of 
line 18054=>which they would not speak. I turned then east and north and journeyed along 
line 18055=>the Greenway; and  not  far from Bree  I came upon  a traveller sitting on a  
line 18056=>bank beside the road with his grazing  horse beside him. It was Radagast the 
line 18057=>Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel,  near the borders of Mirkwood. 
line 18058=>He 
line 18059=>is one of my order, but I had not seen him for many a year. 
line 18060=>     ` "Gandalf! " he cried.  "I was seeking you. But I  am  a  stranger  in 
line 18061=>these parts. All I knew was that  you might  be found  in a wild region with 
line 18062=>the uncouth name of Shire." 
line 18063=>     ' "Your information was  correct," I said. "But do not put it that way, 
line 18064=>if you meet any of the inhabitants. You are near the  borders of  the  Shire 
line 18065=>now.  And what do you want with me?  It must  be pressing.  You were never a  
line 18066=>traveller, unless driven by great need." 
line 18067=>     ' "I have an urgent errand," he said. "My news is evil." Then he looked 
line 18068=>about him, as if  the hedges  might have ears. "Nazgyl,"  he whispered. "The 
line 18069=>Nine are abroad again. They  have  crossed the River secretly and are moving 
line 18070=>westward. They have taken the guise of riders in black." 
line 18071=>     'I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it. 
line 18072=>     ` "The enemy must have some great need or purpose," said Radagast; "but 
line 18073=>what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts, I cannot 
line 18074=>guess." 
line 18075=>     ` "What do you mean? " said I. 
line 18076=>     ` "I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news  of a  
line 18077=>land called Shire." 
line 18078=>     ' "The Shire," I said; but my heart sank. For even the  Wise might fear 
line 18079=>to  withstand the  Nine,  when they  are gathered together under  their fell 
line 18080=>chieftain. A great  king and sorcerer he was  of  old,  and now  he wields a  
line 18081=>deadly fear. "Who told  you, and who sent you? " I asked. 
line 18082=>     ' "Saruman the White,"  answered Radagast. "And  he told me to say that 
line 18083=>if you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it 
line 18084=>will be too late." 
line 18085=>     'And  that  message  brought  me  hope.  For Saruman the  White is  the 
line 18086=>greatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a  worthy  Wizard, a master of 
line 18087=>shapes and changes  of hue;  and he has much  lore of herbs  and beasts, and 
line 18088=>
line 18089=>####-birds are especially  his friends. But Saruman  has long studied the arts of 
line 18090=>the Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was 
line 18091=>by the devices of Saruman  that we drove him  from Dol  Guldur. It might  be 
line 18092=>that he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine. 
line 18093=>     ' "I will go to Saruman," I sa id. 
line 18094=>     ' "Then  you must go  now," said  Radagast; "for I have  wasted time in 
line 18095=>looking  for you,  and  the  days  are running short. I was told to find you  
line 18096=>before Midsummer, and that is now  here. Even if you set out from this spot, 
line 18097=>you will hardly  reach him before the Nine discover the land that they seek. 
line 18098=>I myself  shall turn back at  once." And with that he mounted and would have 
line 18099=>ridden straight off.  
line 18100=>     ` "Stay a  moment! " I said. "We shall  need your help, and the help of 
line 18101=>all things that will give it. Send out messages  to all the beasts and birds 
line 18102=>that are  your friends.  Tell them to bring news  of anything that bears  on 
line 18103=>this matter to Saruman and Gandalf. Let messages be sent to Orthanc." 
line 18104=>     `  "I will do  that,"  he said, and rode off  as if  the Nine were after  
line 18105=>him. 
line 18106=>     `I could not follow him then and  there. I had ridden  very far already 
line 18107=>that day, and I was as weary as my horse;  and I needed to consider matters.  
line 18108=>I stayed the  night in Bree, and decided that I had no time to return to the 
line 18109=>Shire. Never did I make a greater mistake!  
line 18110=>     `However,  I wrote a message  to Frodo,  and trusted  to  my friend the 
line 18111=>innkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn; and I came at long last to 
line 18112=>the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard,  in  the  end  of the 
line 18113=>Misty  Mountains,  not far  from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell you  
line 18114=>that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains and the 
line 18115=>northmost  foothills  of Ered  Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But 
line 18116=>Isengard is a  circle of  sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with  a wall, 
line 18117=>and in the midst of that valley is a tower of  stone called Orthanc.  It was 
line 18118=>not made by Saruman, but by the Men of N®menor long ago; and it is very tall 
line 18119=>and has many secrets; yet  it looks not to be  a work of craft. It cannot be 
line 18120=>reached save  by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle there is 
line 18121=>only one gate. 
line 18122=>     'Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch  in the wall of 
line 18123=>rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the  keepers of the  gate  were on the 
line 18124=>watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and 
line 18125=>the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew 
line 18126=>
line 18127=>####-no reason for it. 
line 18128=>     'But  I rode to the foot of Orthanc,  and came to the stair  of Saruman 
line 18129=>and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber. He wore a ring on his 
line 18130=>finger. 
line 18131=>     `  "So you have come, Gandalf," he said to me gravely; but in  his eyes 
line 18132=>there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart. 
line 18133=>     ` "Yes, I have come," I said. "I have  come  for your  aid, Saruman the 
line 18134=>White." And that title seemed to anger him. 
line 18135=>     '  "Have  you indeed, Gandalf the Grey! " he scoffed.  "For aid? It has 
line 18136=>seldom been  heard of that  Gandalf the Grey sought for  aid, one so cunning  
line 18137=>and  so wise, wandering about  the lands,  and concerning  himself in  every 
line 18138=>business, whether it belongs to him or not." 
line 18139=>     'I looked  at him and wondered.  "But if I am  not deceived,"  said  I, 
line 18140=>"things are now moving which will require the union of all our strength." 
line 18141=>     ' "That may be so," he said, "but the thought is late in coming to you. 
line 18142=>How long. I wonder, have  you concealed  from me, the head of the Council, a  
line 18143=>matter  of greatest  import? What brings you now from your lurking-place  in 
line 18144=>the Shire? " 
line 18145=>     ' "The Nine have come forth again," I answered. "They have crossed  the 
line 18146=>River. So Radagast said to me." 
line 18147=>     ` "Radagast  the Brown! " laughed  Saruman, and  he no longer concealed 
line 18148=>his scorn. "Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool! 
line 18149=>Yet he had just the wit to play the part  that I set him. For you have come, 
line 18150=>and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay,  Gandalf 
line 18151=>the Grey,  and rest  from  journeys.  For  I  am  Saruman the Wise,  Saruman 
line 18152=>Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours! " 
line 18153=>     'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not 
line 18154=>so, but  were woven of  all  colours.  and  if  he moved they shimmered  and 
line 18155=>changed hue so that the eye was bewildered. 
line 18156=>     ' "I liked white better," I said. 
line 18157=>     ' "White! "  he sneered. "It serves as a beginning. White  cloth may be 
line 18158=>dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken." 
line 18159=>     ' "In which case it is  no longer white," said I. "And he that breaks a  
line 18160=>thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom." 
line 18161=>     '  "You need  not  speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for  
line 18162=>friends," said he. "I have not brought  you hither  to be instructed by you, 
line 18163=>but to give you a choice." 
line 18164=>
line 18165=>####-     'He  drew  himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a  
line 18166=>speech  long  rehearsed.  "The Elder Days  are gone.  The  Middle  Days  are 
line 18167=>passing. The Younger Days are  beginning. The time of the Elves is over, but 
line 18168=>our time is at hand: the world of Men, which  we must rule. But we must have 
line 18169=>power, power to order all things as  we  will, for that good  which only the 
line 18170=>Wise can see. 
line 18171=>     '  "And listen, Gandalf,  my old friend and  helper! "  he said, coming 
line 18172=>near and speaking now in a softer voice.  "I said we,  for we it may be,  if 
line 18173=>you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against it the old  allies and 
line 18174=>policies will not avail us  at all. There is no hope left in Elves  or dying 
line 18175=>N®menor. This then  is  one  choice before you. before us. We may jo in  with 
line 18176=>that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf.  There is hope that way.  Its victory 
line 18177=>is at hand; and  there will be rich reward for those that  aided it.  As the 
line 18178=>Power grows, its proved friends will also  grow; and  the Wise, such  as you  
line 18179=>and I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses,  to control it. 
line 18180=>We  can bide  our time, we can keep our  thoughts in our  hearts,  deploring 
line 18181=>maybe  evils done by the way,  but  approving the high and ultimate purpose: 
line 18182=>Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the  things that  we have so far striven in vain 
line 18183=>to accomplish,  hindered rather than helped by  our weak  or  idle  friends.  
line 18184=>There need not be, there would not be, any  real change in our designs, only  
line 18185=>in our means." 
line 18186=>     ' "Saruman," I said, "I  have  heard  speeches  of this kind before, but 
line 18187=>only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to deceive the ignorant. I  
line 18188=>cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears." 
line 18189=>     'He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. "Well, I see 
line 18190=>that this wi se course  does  not commend itself to you,"  he said. "Not yet?  
line 18191=>Not if some better way can be contrived? " 
line 18192=>     `He came and laid his long hand on my arm.  "And why not, Gandalf? " he 
line 18193=>whispered. "Why not? The Ruling Ring? If  we could  command that,  then  the 
line 18194=>Power would pass to us. That is in truth why I brought  you here. For I have 
line 18195=>many eyes  in my service, and  I  believe that  you know where this precious 
line 18196=>thing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what 
line 18197=>is your  business there? " As he said this a lust which he could not conceal 
line 18198=>shone suddenly in his eyes.  
line 18199=>     ' "Saruman," I  said, standing away from him, "only one hand at  a time 
line 18200=>can wield the One, and you know that well, so do not trouble to say we!  But 
line 18201=>I would not give it, nay, I would not give even news of it to you, now  that 
line 18202=>
line 18203=>####-I  learn  your  mind. You  were head of  the Council, but you have  unmasked 
line 18204=>yourself at last. Well, the choices are, it seems, to  submit to  Sauron, or 
line 18205=>to yourself. I will take neither. Have you others to offer? " 
line 18206=>     'He was cold now and perilous. "Yes," he said. "I did not expect you to 
line 18207=>show wisdom, even in your own behalf; but I gave you the chance of aiding me 
line 18208=>willingly. and so saving yourself much trouble and pain. The third choice is 
line 18209=>to stay here, until the end."

line 18211=>     ' "Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find  means 
line 18212=>to  persuade you. Or until  it is found in your despite, and  the Ruler  has 
line 18213=>time to turn to lighter matters:  to devise, say,  a  fitting reward for the 
line 18214=>hindrance and insolence of Gandalf the Grey." 
line 18215=>     ' "That  may not prove to be one of the lighter matters,"  said  I.  He 
line 18216=>laughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it. 
line 18217=>     `They took me and they set me alone  on the p innacle of Orthanc, in the 
line 18218=>place  where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars.  There is no descent 
line 18219=>save  by a narrow stair of many  thousand steps, and  the valley below seems 
line 18220=>far away. I looked  on it and saw that, whereas it  had once been  green and 
line 18221=>fair, it was now filled with pits and forges. Wolves and orcs were housed in 
line 18222=>Isengard,  for Saruman was mustering a  great force  on his  own account, in 
line 18223=>rivalry of Sauron  and  not  in his service yet. Over  all his works  a dark 
line 18224=>smoke hung  and wrapped itself about the sides  of Orthanc. I stood alone on  
line 18225=>an island  in the clouds; and I had  no  chance  of escape, and my days were 
line 18226=>bitter. I was pierced with cold, and I  had but little room in which to pace 
line 18227=>to and fro, brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North. 
line 18228=>     `That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt  assured, apart from  the words 
line 18229=>of Saruman which might  be  lies.  Long ere I came to  Isengard I had  heard 
line 18230=>tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for  
line 18231=>my friends in the Shire; but still I had some  hope.  I hoped that Frodo had 
line 18232=>set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell 
line 18233=>before  the deadly pursuit  began. And  both  my  fear and  my  hope  proved  
line 18234=>ill-founded. For my  hope  was founded on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was 
line 18235=>founded on the cunning of Sauron. But  fat men  who sell ale have many calls 
line 18236=>to answer; and the power of  Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in 
line 18237=>the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy to think that the 
line 18238=>hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter  in  the  Shire far 
line 18239=>away.' 
line 18240=>
line 18241=>####-     `I saw you!' cried Frodo. `You were walking backwards and forwards. The 
line 18242=>moon shone in your hair.' 
line 18243=>     Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. 'I t was only a dream' said 
line 18244=>Frodo, `but it suddenly came back to me. I had  quite  forgotten it. It came 
line 18245=>some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.' 
line 18246=>     `Then it was  late in coming,' said Gandalf, 'as you will see. I was in 
line 18247=>an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that I have seldom  been in 
line 18248=>such need, and  do not bear such  misfortune  well. Gandalf the  Grey caught  
line 18249=>like a fly in a spider's treacherous web! Yet  even  the most subtle spiders 
line 18250=>may leave a weak thread. 
line 18251=>     `At first I  feared,  as Saruman  no doubt intended,  that Radagast had 
line 18252=>also fallen. Yet I  had caught no  hint of anything wrong in his voice or in 
line 18253=>his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I 
line 18254=>should  have gone more warily. So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed  his 
line 18255=>mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been  useless in  any case to 
line 18256=>try and  win over  the honest Radagast  to  treachery. He sought me  in good 
line 18257=>faith, and so persuaded me. 
line 18258=>     `That  was the  undoing of Saruman's plot.  For Radagast knew no reason 
line 18259=>why  he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards Mirkwood where 
line 18260=>he 
line 18261=>had many friends of old. And  the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide, 
line 18262=>and they saw many things: the gathering of wolves and the mustering of Orcs; 
line 18263=>and  the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the  lands; and  they heard 
line 18264=>news  of the  escape  of  Gollum.  And they sent a messenger to  bring these 
line 18265=>tidings to me. 
line 18266=>     `So it  was  that when summer  waned, there came a night of  moon,  and 
line 18267=>Gwaihir the Windlord,  swiftest of  the  Great Eagles,  came unlooked-for to 
line 18268=>Orthanc; and he found me standing  on the pinnacle. Then I  spoke to him and 
line 18269=>he bore me away, before Saruman was aware.  I was far from Isengard, ere the 
line 18270=>wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue me. 
line 18271=>     ` "How far can you bear me? " I said to Gwaihir. 
line 18272=>     ` "Many  leagues," said he,  "but not to  the ends of the earth.  I was 
line 18273=>sent to bear tidings not burdens." 
line 18274=>     ` "Then I must have a steed on land," I said, "and a steed surpassi ngly 
line 18275=>swift, for I have never had such need of haste before." 
line 18276=>     ` "Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord  of Rohan sits in his 
line 18277=>halls," he said; "for that  is not very far off." And I was glad, for in the 
line 18278=>
line 18279=>####-Riddermark of Rohan the  Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell, and  there are no 
line 18280=>horses  like  those that  are  bred in  that  great vale  between the  Misty 
line 18281=>Mountains and the White. 
line 18282=>     ` "Are the Men of  Rohan still to be trusted, do you think? " I said to 
line 18283=>Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith. 
line 18284=>     ` "They pay a tribute of horses," he answered, "and send many yearly to 
line 18285=>Mordor,  or  so it is said; but they are  not  yet under the  yoke.  But  if 
line 18286=>Saruman  has  become evil,  as  you  say, then  their  doom  cannot  be long 
line 18287=>delayed." 
line 18288=>     `He  set  me down  in  the  land of  Rohan ere  dawn;  and  now I  have 
line 18289=>lengthened my tale over long. The  rest must be more brief. In Rohan I found 
line 18290=>evil already at work:  the lies  of Saruman; and the king  of the land would 
line 18291=>not  listen to my warnings. He bade me take a horse and be gone; and I chose 
line 18292=>one much to my liking. but little to his. I took the best horse in his land, 
line 18293=>and I have never seen the like of him.' 
line 18294=>     'Then  he must be a noble beast indeed,' said Aragorn; 'and  it grieves 
line 18295=>me more than many tidings that might seem worse to  learn that Sauron levies 
line 18296=>such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that land.' 
line 18297=>     `Nor is it now, I  will swear,' said Boromir.  `It  is a lie that comes 
line 18298=>from the Enemy.  I  know  the Men of Rohan;  true  a nd  valiant, our allies,  
line 18299=>dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.' 
line 18300=>     `The  shadow  of  Mordor  lies  on  distant lands,'  answered  Aragorn. 
line 18301=>'Saruman has fallen under  it.  Rohan is beset. Who knows what you will find 
line 18302=>there, if ever you return?' 
line 18303=>     `Not this at least.' said Boromir, 'that they will buy their lives with 
line 18304=>horses. They  love  their horses next  to their kin. And not without reason, 
line 18305=>for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North, far from 
line 18306=>the Shadow. and their race, as  that of their masters, is descended from the 
line 18307=>free days of old.' 
line 18308=>     'True indeed!'  said Gandalf. `And there is  one among them that  might 
line 18309=>have been foaled in the morning of the world. The horses of  the Nine cannot 
line 18310=>vie with him; tireless,   swift as the  flowing  wind. Shadowfax  they called 
line 18311=>him. By day  his coat glistens like silver; and by night it is like a shade, 
line 18312=>and  he  passes unseen. Light  is his footfall!  Never  before had  any  man 
line 18313=>mounted him, but I took him and I tamed him, and  so speedily he bore me that 
line 18314=>I  reached the Shire when  Frodo  was on the  Barrow-downs, though I set out 
line 18315=>from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton. 
line 18316=>
line 18317=>####-     'But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of 
line 18318=>the Riders, and though I gained  on them day by day,  they were  ever before 
line 18319=>me.  They had divided their  forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern 
line 18320=>borders,  not far  from the Greenway. and  some  invaded the Shire  from the  
line 18321=>south.  I came  to  Hobbiton  and Frodo  had gone; but I had words with  old 
line 18322=>Gamgee.  Many  words and  few to  the  point. He  had much to  say about the 
line 18323=>shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End. 
line 18324=>     ` "I can't abide changes," said he, "not  at my time of life, and least  
line 18325=>of all changes  for  the worst." "Changes for the  worst," he repeated  many 
line 18326=>times. 
line 18327=>     ' "Worst is a bad word," I said to him, "and I hope you do not  live to 
line 18328=>see it." But amidst his talk I gathered at last that Frodo had left Hobbiton 
line 18329=>less than a week before, and that a  black horseman had come to the Hill the 
line 18330=>same  evening. Then I rode  on  in  fear. I came to Buckland and found it in 
line 18331=>uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick. I came 
line 18332=>to  the house at  Crickhollow, and  it was broken open and empty; but on the 
line 18333=>threshold there lay a  cloak  that had  been Frodo's. Then for a while  hope 
line 18334=>left me, and I did not wait  to gather news, or I might have been comforted; 
line 18335=>but I rode on the trail of the Riders. It was  hard to  follow, for  it went 
line 18336=>many ways, and  I was at a loss. But  it  seemed  to me that one  or two had 
line 18337=>ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought  of words that might  
line 18338=>be said to the innkeeper. 
line 18339=>     ' "Butterbur they call him," thought I. "If this delay was his fault, I 
line 18340=>will melt  all the butter in him. I  will roast the  old  fool  over a  slow 
line 18341=>fire."  He expected no  less, and when he saw  my face he fell down flat and 
line 18342=>began to melt on the spot.' 
line 18343=>     `What did you  do  to  him?' cried  Frodo in alarm. 'He was really very 
line 18344=>kind to us and did a ll that he could.' 
line 18345=>     Gandalf laughed.  'Don't be afraid!' he  said. `I  did not bite,  and I 
line 18346=>barked very little. So  overjoyed was I by  the news that I got out of  him, 
line 18347=>when he stopped  quaking, that I embraced  the old fellow. How it happened I 
line 18348=>could  not  then  guess, but I  learned  that you had been in Bree the night 
line 18349=>before, and had gone off that morning with Strider. 
line 18350=>     ` "Strider! " I cried, shouting for joy. 
line 18351=>     `  "Yes,  sir, I am afraid so, sir," said Butterbur, mistaking me.  "He 
line 18352=>got  at them,  in spite of all that I could do, and  they took  up with him. 
line 18353=>They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say." 
line 18354=>
line 18355=>####-     ` "Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman!  " said I. "It's  the 
line 18356=>best news I have had since midsummer: it's worth a gold piece at  the least. 
line 18357=>May  your  beer be  laid under an enchantment of surpassing  excellence  for  
line 18358=>seven years! " said  I. "Now I can take a night's  rest, the first  since  I 
line 18359=>have forgotten when." 
line 18360=>     `So I  stayed  there that  night, wondering much what had become of the 
line 18361=>Riders; for only of two had there yet been any news in Bree, it seemed.  But 
line 18362=>in the night we heard more. Five at least came from the west, and they threw 
line 18363=>down  the gates  and passed  through Bree  like  a  howling  wi nd;  and  the 
line 18364=>Bree-folk are still shivering and  expecting the end of the world. I got  up 
line 18365=>before dawn and went after them. 
line 18366=>     'I do not  know, but it seems clear  to me that this is  what happened. 
line 18367=>Their  Captain remained  in secret away  south of Bree, while two rode ahead 
line 18368=>through the village,  and four more  invaded the Shire. But when these  were 
line 18369=>foiled  in Bree  and  at Crickhollow, they  returned to their  Captain  with 
line 18370=>tidings, and so left the Road unguarded for  a while, except by their spies. 
line 18371=>The Captain then sent some eastward straight across country, and he  himself 
line 18372=>with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath. 
line 18373=>     'I galloped to Weathertop like  a gale, and I reached it before sundown 
line 18374=>on  my  second day from  Bree-and they were there befor e me.  They drew 
line 18375=>away 
line 18376=>from  me, for  they  felt the coming of my anger and they dared not  face it 
line 18377=>while the Sun  was  in the sky.  But they closed  round at  night, and I was 
line 18378=>besieged on the hill-top, in the old ring of Amon Syl. I was hard  put to it 
line 18379=>indeed:  such light and flame  cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the 
line 18380=>war-beacons of old. 
line 18381=>     `At sunrise I  escaped and fled towards the north. I  could not hope to 
line 18382=>do  more. It was impossible to  find you, Frodo, in  the wilderness, and  it 
line 18383=>would ha ve been folly  to try  with all the Nine  at  my heels. So I  had to 
line 18384=>trust  to Aragorn.  But I  hoped  to draw  some  of them  off, and yet reach 
line 18385=>Rivendell ahead of you  and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, 
line 18386=>but they turned back  after a  wh ile and made  for the Ford,  it seems. That 
line 18387=>helped a  little,  for there  were only five, not  nine,  when your camp was 
line 18388=>attacked. 
line 18389=>     'I  reached here at last  by  a long  hard  road,  up the Hoarwell  and 
line 18390=>through the  Ettenmoors, and down from the north . It took me nearly fourteen 
line 18391=>days  from  Weathertop,  for  I  could  not  ride  among  the rocks  of  the 
line 18392=>
line 18393=>####-troll-fells, and  Shadowfax departed.  I sent  him back to his master; but a  
line 18394=>great friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my 
line 18395=>call.  But so it  was  that I  came to Rivendell  only three days before the 
line 18396=>Ring, and news of  its peril had already been brought here-which proved well 
line 18397=>indeed. 
line 18398=>     `And  that, Frodo, is  the end of my account. May Elrond and the others 
line 18399=>forgive  the length of  it.  But such a thing has not happened  before, that 
line 18400=>Gandalf broke tryst and did not come  when  he  promised. An account to  the 
line 18401=>Ring-bearer of so strange an event was required, I think. 
line 18402=>     'Well, the  Tale is now  told, from first to last. Here we all are, and 
line 18403=>here is the Ring. But we have not yet come any  nearer to our  purpose. What 
line 18404=>shall we do with it?' 
line 18405=>     There was silence. At last Elrond spoke again. 
line 18406=>     `This  is grievous news concerning Saruman,' he  said; `for  we trusted 
line 18407=>him and he  is deep in  all our counsels. It is perilous to study too deeply 
line 18408=>the arts of the Enemy, for  good  or  for ill. But such falls and betrayals,  
line 18409=>alas, have happened before. Of  the tales that  we have heard  this  day the 
line 18410=>tale  of  Frodo was most strange  to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo 
line 18411=>here; and it seems to me that he is  perhaps  not so alone and singular as I 
line 18412=>had thought him. The world has changed much since I last was on the 
line 18413=>westward 
line 18414=>roads. 
line 18415=>     `The  Barrow-wights we know by  many names; and of the Old Forest  
line 18416=>many 
line 18417=>tales have been told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern 
line 18418=>march. Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what  is now 
line 18419=>the  Shire to Dunland west of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and 
line 18420=>many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed 
line 18421=>this is still the same that walked the woods and  hills long  ago, and  even 
line 18422=>then was older than the old. That was not then his name. Iarwain Ben -adar we 
line 18423=>called  him,  oldest and  fatherless. But many another name he has since been  
line 18424=>given by other folk:  Forn by the Dwarves,  Orald by Northern Men, and other  
line 18425=>names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned 
line 18426=>him 
line 18427=>to our Council.' 
line 18428=>     `He would not have come,' said Gandalf. 
line 18429=>     `Could  we not still send messages to him  and obtain his help?'  asked 
line 18430=>
line 18431=>####-Erestor. `It seems that he has a power even over the Ring.' 
line 18432=>     `No, I should not put  it so,'  said Gandalf. `Say rather that the Ring 
line 18433=>has no power over him. He is  his own master.  But he  cannot alter  the Ring 
line 18434=>itself,  nor break its  power over  others.  And now he is withdrawn  into a  
line 18435=>little  land,  within  bounds that  he  has set, though none  can  see them, 
line 18436=>waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not  step beyond them.' 
line 18437=>     `But within those bounds nothing seems to  dismay him,'  said  Erestor. 
line 18438=>`Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever harmless?' 
line 18439=>     `No,' said Gandalf, `not willingly. He might  do so,  if all  the  free 
line 18440=>folk of the world begged  him, but he would not understand the need. And  if 
line 18441=>he were given  the Ring,  he would soon  forget  it, or most likely throw it 
line 18442=>away. Such  things  have  no hold on his mind. He  would  be  a  most unsafe 
line 18443=>guardian; and that alone is answer enough. ' 
line 18444=>     `But in any case,' said Glorfindel, `to send the Ring to him would only 
line 18445=>postpone the day of evil. He  is far away. We could not now take  it back to 
line 18446=>him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy.  And even if we could, soon or late the 
line 18447=>Lord of  the Rings wou ld learn of  its hiding place and  would bend  all his 
line 18448=>power towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not. 
line 18449=>I think that in the end, if all  else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last 
line 18450=>as he was First; and then Night will come.' 
line 18451=>     `I know little of Iarwain save the name,' said Galdor; `but Glorfindel, 
line 18452=>I think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless  such power  
line 18453=>is  in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron  can torture and destroy 
line 18454=>the very hills. What power still remains lies with us,  here in Imladris, or  
line 18455=>with Cirdan at the Havens, or in Lurien. But have they the strength, have we 
line 18456=>here the strength to withstand the Enemy, the  coming of Sauron at the last, 
line 18457=>when all else is overthrown?' 
line 18458=>     `I have not the strength,' said Elrond; `neither have they.' 
line 18459=>     `Then if the  Ring cannot be  kept  from him for ever by strength' said 
line 18460=>Glorfindel, `two things only remain  for  us to attempt: to send it over the 
line 18461=>Sea, or to destroy it.' 
line 18462=>     `But Gandalf has revealed to u s that  we cannot destroy it by any craft  
line 18463=>that we here possess,' said Elrond. `And they who dwell beyond the Sea would 
line 18464=>not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who 
line 18465=>still dwell here to deal with it.' 
line 18466=>     'Then, said Glorfindel, 'let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the 
line 18467=>lies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that  even at the Council his 
line 18468=>
line 18469=>####-feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the Ring  was not lost for  
line 18470=>ever, but wished us to think so; for  he began to lust  for  it for himself. 
line 18471=>Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.' 
line 18472=>     `Not safe  for ever,' said Gandalf. `There are many things in the  deep 
line 18473=>waters; and seas and lands may  change. And it is not our part here to  take 
line 18474=>thought only for a  season, or for a few lives  of Men, or for a passing age 
line 18475=>of the world.  We should seek a final  end of this menace, even if we do not 
line 18476=>hope to make one.' 
line 18477=>     'And that we shall not find on the roads to the  Sea,' said Galdor. 'If 
line 18478=>the  return to Iarwain be  thought too dangerous, then  flight to the S‚a is 
line 18479=>now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us 
line 18480=>to take the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The 
line 18481=>Nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is  but a respite, ere they find  new 
line 18482=>steeds and  swifter. Only the waning might of Gondor stands  now between him 
line 18483=>and a march  in power along the  coasts into  the  North;  and if  he comes, 
line 18484=>assailing the White Towers and the  Havens, hereafter the Elves may  have no 
line 18485=>escape from the lengthening shadows of Middle-earth.' 
line 18486=>     'Long yet will that march be delayed,' said Boromir. 'Gondor wanes, you  
line 18487=>say.  But  Gondor stands,  and even the end  of its strength  is  still very 
line 18488=>strong.' 
line 18489=>     'And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back  the Nine,' said Galdor. 
line 18490=>'And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.' 
line 18491=>     'Then,' said Erestor, `there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already 
line 18492=>has declared:  to hide  the Ring  for ever;  or to  unmake it.  But both are 
line 18493=>beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?' 
line 18494=>     'None here can do so,' said Elrond gravely. `At least none can foretell 
line 18495=>what will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now 
line 18496=>clear which is the road that  we must take. The westward road seems easiest.  
line 18497=>Therefore it must  be shunned. It will be watched. Too  often the Elves have 
line 18498=>fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. 
line 18499=>There  lies our hope, if hope it be. To walk into  peril-to  Mordor. We must 
line 18500=>send the Ring to the Fire.' 
line 18501=>     Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house,  looking out upon a  
line 18502=>sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in 
line 18503=>his heart. Boromir  stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He  was finger ing  his 
line 18504=>great horn and frowning. At length he spoke. 
line 18505=>     'I do not understand all this,' he said. `Saruman is a traitor, but did 
line 18506=>
line 18507=>####-he not have  a  glimpse of  wisdom?  Why  do  you speak  ever of  hiding and 
line 18508=>destroying? Why should we not think  that the  Great Ring  has come into our 
line 18509=>hands to serve us in the very  hour of need? Wielding  it the Free  Lords of 
line 18510=>the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem. 
line 18511=>     'The  Men of Gondor are valiant, and they  will never  submit; but they 
line 18512=>may be  beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and then a weapon. Let the 
line 18513=>Ring be  your  weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth  
line 18514=>to victory!' 
line 18515=>     'Alas, no,' said  Elrond. 'We cannot use  the Ruling  Ring. That we now 
line 18516=>know  too well.  It belongs to  Sauron and was  made by  him  alone,  and is 
line 18517=>altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone  to wield at 
line 18518=>will, save only those who have already a great power  of their own.  But for 
line 18519=>them it holds an  even deadlier peril.  The very  desire of it  corrupts the 
line 18520=>heart. Consider  Saruman. If any of the Wise should with this Ring overthrow 
line 18521=>the  Lord  of Mordor,  using  his own arts,  he  would then  set  himself on 
line 18522=>Sauron's throne, and yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another  
line 18523=>reason  why the  Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the  world it 
line 18524=>will be a danger  even to  the Wise. For nothing  is evil in the  beginning. 
line 18525=>Even Sauron was not so. I fear to  take the Ring to hide it. I will not take 
line 18526=>the Ring to wield it.' 
line 18527=>     `Nor I,' said Gandalf. 
line 18528=>     Boromir looked at  them doubtfully,  but he bowed his head. `So be it,' 
line 18529=>he said. `Then in Gondor we must trust  to  such weapons as we have.  And at 
line 18530=>the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight on. Mayhap the 
line 18531=>Sword-that-was-Broken may still stem the tide --  if the hand that wields it 
line 18532=>has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.' 
line 18533=>     `Who can tell?' said Aragorn. `But we will put it to the test one day.' 
line 18534=>     `May the  day not be too long delayed,' said Boromir. 'For though  I do 
line 18535=>not ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort  us to know that others fought 
line 18536=>also with all the means that they have.' 
line 18537=>     `Then  be comforted,'  said  Elrond.  `For  there are  other powers and 
line 18538=>realms that  you know not, and  they are hidden from you.  Anduin  the Great 
line 18539=>flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor.' 
line 18540=>     'Still it might be  well for all,' said Gluin the Dwarf,  'if all these 
line 18541=>strengths were joined, and  the powers  of each  were used in  league. Other  
line 18542=>rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be  used in  our need.  The 
line 18543=>Seven are lost  to us  -- if Balin has not found the ring of Thrur which  was 
line 18544=>
line 18545=>####-the last; naught has been heard of it since Thrur  perished in Moria. Indeed 
line 18546=>I  may  now reveal that it was partly in  hope to find that  ring that Balin 
line 18547=>went away.' 
line 18548=>     `Balin will find no  ring in  Moria,'  said  Gandalf. `Thrur gave it to 
line 18549=>Thrbin his  son,  but not Thrbin to Thorin. It was taken  with  torment from 
line 18550=>Thrbin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.' 
line 18551=>     'Ah, alas!' cried Gluin.  'When will  the day come of our  revenge? But 
line 18552=>still there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of the Elves? Very mighty 
line 18553=>Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by 
line 18554=>the Dark  Lord long ago. Are  they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not 
line 18555=>say?' 
line 18556=>     The  Elves returned  no answer.  `Did you not  hear  me,  Gluin?'  said 
line 18557=>Elrond.  `The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever touch them. But 
line 18558=>of them it  is not permitted to speak. So much only in this' hour of doubt I 
line 18559=>may now say. They are not idle. But they were  not made as weapons of war or  
line 18560=>conquest:  that is  not  their power.  Those who  made  them did  not desire 
line 18561=>strength or  domination or  hoarded wealth, but understanding,  making,  and 
line 18562=>healing,  to preserve  all  things  unstained.  These things  the  Elves  of 
line 18563=>Middle-earth have in  some measure gained,  though with sorrow. But all that 
line 18564=>has  been wrought  by those who wield the Three will turn  to their undoing,  
line 18565=>and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the 
line 18566=>One. It would be better if the Three had never been. That is his purpose.' 
line 18567=>     `But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring  were  destroyed as you  
line 18568=>counsel?' asked Gluin. 
line 18569=>     'We know not for certain,' answered  Elrond sadly. `Some hope that  the 
line 18570=>Three Rings,  which Sauron  has never touched,  would  then become free, and 
line 18571=>their  rulers might heal  the  hurts of  the world that he has wrought.  But 
line 18572=>maybe  when the One has gone, the Three will fail, and many fair things will 
line 18573=>fade and be forgotten. That is my belief.' 
line 18574=>     `Yet all  the Elves are willing to endure this chance,' said Glorfindel 
line 18575=>'if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be  
line 18576=>taken away for ever.' 
line 18577=>     'Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,' said Erestor, 
line 18578=>`and  yet we come  no  nearer. What  strength have we for the finding of the 
line 18579=>Fire in which  it was made? That  is  the path of despair. Of folly I  would  
line 18580=>say, if the long wisdom of Elrond did not forbid me.' 
line 18581=>     'Despair, or folly?' said Gandalf.  `It is not  despair, for despair is 
line 18582=>
line 18583=>####-only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.  It is wisdom to 
line 18584=>recognize  necessity,  when all  other courses have been  weighed, though as 
line 18585=>folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our 
line 18586=>cloak, a veil before the eyes of the  Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs 
line 18587=>all  things to a nicety in  the scales  of his malice. But the only  measure 
line 18588=>that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into 
line 18589=>his  heart  the thought will not enter that any will refuse it, that  having 
line 18590=>the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of 
line 18591=>reckoning.' 
line 18592=>     'At  least  for a while,' said  Elrond. `The road must  be trod, but it 
line 18593=>will  be very hard. And neither strength nor  wisdom will  carry us far upon 
line 18594=>it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. 
line 18595=>Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small  
line 18596=>hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.' 
line 18597=>     'Very  well,  very well,  Master Elrond!'  said Bilbo suddenly. 'Say no 
line 18598=>more! It  is plain  enough  what you are  pointing at. Bilbo the silly hobbit 
line 18599=>started this  affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very 
line 18600=>comfortable here, and getting  on  with my  book.  If you want to know, I am 
line 18601=>just  writing  an  ending  for it.  I had   thought of putting: and  he lived 
line 18602=>happily ever afterwards  to the end of  his days.  It is a  good ending, and 
line 18603=>none the worse for having been used before. Now  I shall have to alter that: 
line 18604=>it does not look  like coming true;  and anyway there will evidently have to 
line 18605=>be  several  more chapters, if  I live to  write  them.  It  is  a frightful 
line 18606=>nuisance. When ought I to start?  
line 18607=>     ' Boromir  looked  in surprise  at Bilbo, but the laughter died  on his 
line 18608=>lips  when he saw that  all the others regarded  the  old  hobbit with grave 
line 18609=>respect. Only Gluin smiled, but his smile came from old memories.  
line 18610=>     `Of course,  my dear Bilbo,' said Gandalf. `If  you had  really started 
line 18611=>this affair,  you might be expected to finish  it. But you know  well enough 
line 18612=>now that starting is too great a claim for  any, and that only  a small part 
line 18613=>is played in  great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the word was 
line 18614=>meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you  are  making a valiant offer. 
line 18615=>But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You cannot take this thing back. It has 
line 18616=>passed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your  part is 
line 18617=>ended,  unless  as a  recorder.  Finish  your book,  and  leave  the  ending 
line 18618=>unaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel, when 
line 18619=>they come back.' 
line 18620=>
line 18621=>####-     Bilbo laughed. `I have never known you give me pleasant advice before.' 
line 18622=>he said.  `As  all your  unpleasant  advice has been  good, I wonder if this 
line 18623=>advice is not  bad. Still, I don't suppose I have the strength  or luck left  
line 18624=>to deal with the Ring. It has  grown, and I have  not.  But tell me: what do 
line 18625=>you mean by they?' 
line 18626=>     `The messengers who are sent with the Ring.' 
line 18627=>     `Exactly! And who are  they to be?  That seems to me  what this Council  
line 18628=>has to decide, and all  that  it has to decide. Elves  may  thrive on speech 
line 18629=>alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness;  but I am only an old hobbit, and 
line 18630=>I miss  my meal at noon. Can't you think of some  names  now?  Or put it off 
line 18631=>till after dinner?' 
line 18632=>     No one answered. The  noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced 
line 18633=>at all the faces, but they were not  turned to him. All the Council sat with 
line 18634=>downcast eyes,  as if in deep  thought. A great dread fell on him,  as if he 
line 18635=>was  awaiting  the pronouncement of some doom that he had long  foreseen  and 
line 18636=>vainly  hoped might after all never be spoken.  An  overwhelming longing  to 
line 18637=>rest and remain at peace by Bilbo's side in Rivendell filled all  his heart. 
line 18638=>At last with an effort  he spoke, and wondered to hear his  own words, as if 
line 18639=>some other will was using his small voice. 
line 18640=>     `I will take the Ring,' he said, `though I do not know the way.' 
line 18641=>     Elrond raised  his eyes and looked  at  him, and Frodo felt  his  heart 
line 18642=>pierced by the sudden keenness  of the glance. `If  I understand aright  all 
line 18643=>that I  have heard,' he said, `I think that this task  is appointed for you, 
line 18644=>Frodo; and that if you do not find a way, no  one will. This is the hour  of 
line 18645=>the Shire-folk, when they arise from  their quiet fields to shake the towers 
line 18646=>and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise  could  have foreseen it? Or,  
line 18647=>if they are wise, why  should they expect  to know it,  until  the hour  has 
line 18648=>struck? 
line 18649=>     `But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that  none could lay it on another. 
line 18650=>I do not lay it  on  you. But  if you  take it freely, I  will say that your 
line 18651=>choice  is right;  and though all the mighty elf-friends of  old, Hador, and 
line 18652=>H®rin, and T®rin, and Beren himself were assembled together your seat 
line 18653=>should 
line 18654=>be among them.' 
line 18655=>     `But you won't send him off alone surely, Mast er?' cried Sam, unable to 
line 18656=>contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been 
line 18657=>quietly sitting on the floor. 
line 18658=>
line 18659=>####-     `No indeed!'  said Elrond, turning towards  him with a smile.  `You  at 
line 18660=>least shall go with him. It  is  hardly  possi ble to separate  you from him, 
line 18661=>even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.' 
line 18662=>     Sam sat  down, blushing and muttering.  `A nice  pickle we  have landed  
line 18663=>ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!' he said, shaking his head. 
line 18664=> 
line 18665=>
line 18666=>####- 
line 18667=>
line 18668=>Chapter 3. The Ring Goes South 
line 18669=>
line 18670=> 
line 18671=> 
line 18672=>     Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo's room. 
line 18673=>Merry  and Pippin were indignant when they heard that Sam had crept into the 
line 18674=>Council, and had been chosen as Frodo's companion. 
line 18675=>     `It's most  unfair,' said  Pippin. `Instea d of  throwing  him out,  and 
line 18676=>clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and rewards him for his cheek!' 
line 18677=>     `Rewards!'  said Frodo.  'I can't imagine a more severe punishment. You  
line 18678=>are not  thinking what  you  are saying:  condemned  to  go on this hopeless 
line 18679=>journey, a  reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my  task  was done, and I could 
line 18680=>rest here, a long while, perhaps for good.' 
line 18681=>     'I don't wonder,' said Merry, 'and I wish you could. But we are envying 
line 18682=>Sam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be  a punishment for any of us 
line 18683=>to  be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have  come a long way with you and 
line 18684=>been through some stiff times. We want to go on.' 
line 18685=>     `That's  what  I  meant,'  said  Pippin. `We  hobbits  ought  to  stick  
line 18686=>together, and  we will. I shall go,  unless they chain me up.  There must be 
line 18687=>someone with intelligence in the party.' 
line 18688=>     'Then  you certainly will not  be chosen, Peregrin Took!' said Gandalf, 
line 18689=>looking in through  the window, which was  near the ground. `But you are all 
line 18690=>worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing is decided yet.' 
line 18691=>     `Nothing  decided!' cried Pippin. 'Then what  were  you  all doing? You  
line 18692=>were shut up for hours.' 
line 18693=>     "Talking,' said Bilbo. `There was a deal  of  talk, and everyone had an 
line 18694=>eye-opener. Even old Gandalf.  I think  Legolas's  bit  of news  about Gollum 
line 18695=>caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.' 
line 18696=>     `You were wrong,'  said Gandalf. 'You  were  inattentive. I had already 
line 18697=>heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only real eye-openers, as 
line 18698=>you put  it,  were you  and Frodo;  and  I was  the  only  one  that was not 
line 18699=>surprised.' 
line 18700=>     `Well,  anyway,'  said Bilbo, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor  
line 18701=>Frodo  and Sam. I was  afraid all  the time that it might come to that, if I 
line 18702=>was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the 
line 18703=>reports come in. Have they started yet, Gandalf?' 
line 18704=>     'Yes,' said the wizard. `Some of the scouts have been sent out already. 
line 18705=>
line 18706=>####-More will go  tomorrow.  Elrond is sending Elves, and they will get in touch 
line 18707=>with the Rangers, and maybe  with  Thranduil's folk in Mirkwood. And 
line 18708=>Aragorn 
line 18709=>has gone with Elrond's  sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for  
line 18710=>many long  leagues before any  move is  made. So cheer  up, Frodo! You  will 
line 18711=>probably make quite a long stay here.' 
line 18712=>     'Ah!' said  Sam gloomily.  'We'll  just wait long enough for  winter to 
line 18713=>come.' 
line 18714=>     'That can't be  helped,' said Bilbo.  'It's your fault partly, Frodo my 
line 18715=>lad: insisting on waiting  for my  birthday. A  funny way of honouring it, I 
line 18716=>can't help thinking. Not the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B .s 
line 18717=>into Bag End. But there it is: you can't wait now fill spring; and you can't  
line 18718=>go till the reports come back. 
line 18719=>     When winter first begins to bite  
line 18720=>     and stones crack in the frosty night, 
line 18721=>     when pools are black and trees are bare, 
line 18722=>     'tis evil in the Wild to fare. 
line 18723=>     But that I am afraid will be just your luck.' 
line 18724=>     'I am  afraid  it  will,' said Gandalf. 'We  can't start until  we have 
line 18725=>found out about the Riders.' 
line 18726=>     `I thought they were all destroyed in the flood,' said Merry. 
line 18727=>     'You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,' said Gandalf. `The power of 
line 18728=>their master  is in them, and  they stand or fall by  him. We hope that they 
line 18729=>were all unhorsed and unmasked, and so made  for a while less dangerous;  but 
line 18730=>we must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your  
line 18731=>troubles, Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to  help you; but I will 
line 18732=>whisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence would be needed in  
line 18733=>the party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.' 
line 18734=>     So great was Frodo's delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the 
line 18735=>window-sill, where he  had been sitting, and took off his hat and  bowed. 'I  
line 18736=>only said I think I shall come. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter  
line 18737=>Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which reminds me, 
line 18738=>I want to see Elrond. I must be off.' 
line 18739=>     `How long  do you  think I  shall have here?' said  Frodo to Bilbo when 
line 18740=>Gandalf had gone. 
line 18741=>     `Oh,  I don't know. I can't count  days in Rivendell,' said Bilbo. 'But 
line 18742=>quite long, I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping 
line 18743=>
line 18744=>####-me with my book, and making a  start  on the next?  Have you  thought of  an 
line 18745=>ending?' 
line 18746=>     'Yes, several, a nd all are dark and unpleasant,' said Frodo. 
line 18747=>     'Oh, that won't do!' said Bilbo. `Books ought to have good endings. How 
line 18748=>would this do:  and they all  settled  down and  lived together happily ever 
line 18749=>after?' 
line 18750=>     `It will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said Frodo. 
line 18751=>     'Ah!' said Sam. 'And where will they live? That's what I often wonder.' 
line 18752=>     For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey 
line 18753=>and of the perils  that  lay ahead; but such  was the  virtue of the land of 
line 18754=>Rivendell that soon all  fear  and anxiety was lifted  from their minds. The 
line 18755=>future, good or  ill, was not forgotten, but ceased to have  any  power over  
line 18756=>the present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with 
line 18757=>each good day as it came, taking plea sure in every  meal,  and in every word 
line 18758=>and song. 
line 18759=>     So the days slipped away, as  each morning dawned  bright and fair, and 
line 18760=>each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was waning fast; slowly the 
line 18761=>golden light  faded to pale silver, and the  lingering leaves fell  from the 
line 18762=>naked trees. A wind began to  blow  chill  from  the  Misty Mountains to the 
line 18763=>east. The Hunter's Moon waxed round in the  night sky, and put to flight all 
line 18764=>the  lesser stars. But low  in the South one star shone red. Every night, as 
line 18765=>the  Moon  waned  again,  it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it 
line 18766=>from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared 
line 18767=>above the trees on the brink of the valley. 
line 18768=>     The hobbits had been nearly  two  months  in the House  of  Elrond, and 
line 18769=>November  had  gone by  with the  last  shreds  of autumn, and  December was 
line 18770=>passing, when the scouts  began to  return. Some  had  gone north beyond the 
line 18771=>springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors;  and others had gone west,  and  
line 18772=>with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the 
line 18773=>Greyflood, as far as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed  the river by 
line 18774=>a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some  of these had  crossed 
line 18775=>the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the 
line 18776=>source of the Gladden River, and had come  down into Wilderland and over the 
line 18777=>Gladden  Fields  and so at  length had reached the old  home  of Radagast at 
line 18778=>Rhosgobel. Radagast was not there; and they had  returned over the high pass 
line 18779=>that was called the Dimrill Stair. The sons of Elrond, Elladan and  Elrohir, 
line 18780=>were the  last  to return;  they had  made a great journey, passing down the 
line 18781=>
line 18782=>####-Silverlode into  a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak 
line 18783=>to any save to Elrond. 
line 18784=>     In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings  of the 
line 18785=>Riders  or other  servants of the  Enemy. Even from the Eagles of the  Misty 
line 18786=>Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen  or heard of 
line 18787=>Gollum; but the wild wolves were still gathering, and were hunting again far  
line 18788=>up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned 
line 18789=>in  the flooded Ford.  On  the  rocks  of  the  rapids  below  it  searchers 
line 18790=>discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black cloak, slashed and 
line 18791=>tattered. Of the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was 
line 18792=>their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the North.  
line 18793=>     'Eight  out of the Nine are  accounted for at least, ' said Gandalf. 'It 
line 18794=>is  rash  to  be  too  sure,  yet I think that  we  may hope  now  that  the 
line 18795=>Ringwraiths  were  scattered,  and  have been obliged to return as best they 
line 18796=>could to their Master in Mordor, empty and shapeless.  
line 18797=>     `If that  is so,  it wi ll be some time before they  can begin the  hunt 
line 18798=>again. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey 
line 18799=>all the way to  the borders of Rivendell before they can pick  up our trail. 
line 18800=>And  if we are  careful that  will be  hard to find.  But  we  must delay no 
line 18801=>longer.' 
line 18802=>     Elrond  summoned the hobbits to him.  He looked gravely  at Frodo. 'The 
line 18803=>time has  come,' he said.  `If the Ring is to set out, it  must go soon. But 
line 18804=>those who go with it must  not  count on their  errand being aided by  war or 
line 18805=>force.  They  must pass into the domain of  the Enemy far from  aid. Do  you  
line 18806=>still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?' 
line 18807=>     'I do,' said Frodo. `I will go with Sam.' 
line 18808=>     `Then  I cannot help you  much, not even with counsel,' said Elrond. `I  
line 18809=>can foresee very little of your road; and how your task is to be achieved  I 
line 18810=>do not know. The  Shadow has  crept now  to the  feet  of the Mountains, and 
line 18811=>draws nigh even  to  the  borders of Greyflood; and  under the Shadow all is 
line 18812=>dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and  
line 18813=>you 
line 18814=>may find friends upon your way when you  least look for it. I will send  out 
line 18815=>messages, such  as I can contrive, to  those  whom I know in the wide world;  
line 18816=>but so  perilous are the  lands now become that some  may well  miscarry, or  
line 18817=>come no quicker than you yourself.  
line 18818=>     `And I will choose you companions to go with  you, as far as  they will 
line 18819=>
line 18820=>####-or fortune  allows. The number must be  few, since your hope is in speed and 
line 18821=>secrecy. Had  I a host of Elves  in armour of the Elder Days, it would avail 
line 18822=>little, save to arouse the power of Mordor. 
line 18823=>     `The Company of the Ring  shall be Nine;  and the Nine Walkers shall be 
line 18824=>set  against  the  Nine Riders  that are  evil. With you and  your  faithful 
line 18825=>servant, Gandalf will go;  for this shall be his  great task,  and maybe the 
line 18826=>end of his labours.  
line 18827=>     `For  the  rest, they  shall represent the  other  Free Peoples  of the 
line 18828=>World:  Elves, Dwarves, and  Men. Legolas  shall be for the Elves; and Gimli 
line 18829=>son of Gluin for the Dwarves. They are willing to go at least  to the passes 
line 18830=>of the  Mountains,  and maybe beyond. For men you shall have  Aragorn son of 
line 18831=>Arathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.' 
line 18832=>     `Strider!' said Frodo. 
line 18833=>     'Yes,' he  said  with  a  smile.  `I ask  leave  once again to be  your 
line 18834=>companion, Frodo.' 
line 18835=>     `I would have begged you to come,' said Frodo, 'only I thought you were 
line 18836=>going to Minas Tirith with Boromir.' 
line 18837=>     `I am,' said  Aragorn. `And the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be reforged 
line 18838=>ere I  set out to  war. But your road  and our  road  lie  together for many 
line 18839=>hundreds  of  miles. Therefore Boromir  will also be in the Company. He is a 
line 18840=>valiant man.' 
line 18841=>     'There remain  two more  to  be  found,'  said  Elrond.  "These  I will 
line 18842=>consider. Of my household I may find some that it seems good to me to send.' 
line 18843=>     `But  that will leave  no place for  us!'  cried Pippin in  dismay. `We 
line 18844=>don't want to be left behind. We want to go with Frodo.' 
line 18845=>     `That  is  because  you do not understand a nd cannot imagine what  lies 
line 18846=>ahead,' said Elrond. 
line 18847=>     `Neither  does Frodo,'  said  Gandalf,  unexpectedly supporting Pippin. 
line 18848=>'Nor do  any of us see clearly. It is true that  if these hobbits understood 
line 18849=>the danger, they would  not dare to go. But they wou ld  still wish to go, or  
line 18850=>wish that  they dared, and be shamed  and unhappy.  I think, Elrond, that in 
line 18851=>this matter it  would be well to  trust  rather  to their friendship than to 
line 18852=>great wisdom. Even if you chose for us an elf-lord,  such as  Glorfindel, he 
line 18853=>could not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road  to the Fire by the  power 
line 18854=>that is in him.' 
line 18855=>     `You  speak  gravely,'  said Elrond, `but  I am in doubt. The Shire,  I 
line 18856=>forebode,  is not free now from peril;  and these two I had thought to  send 
line 18857=>
line 18858=>####-back there as messengers, to do what they could, according to the fashion of 
line 18859=>their country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that 
line 18860=>the younger of these two, Peregrin Took,  should remain. My heart is against 
line 18861=>his going.' 
line 18862=>     `Then, Master Elrond, you will have to  lock  me in prison,  or send me 
line 18863=>home  tied in  a  sack,'  said  Pippin. `For  otherwise  I shall follow  the 
line 18864=>Company.' 
line 18865=>     `Let it be so then. You shall go,' said Elrond, and he sighed. 'Now the 
line 18866=>tale of Nine is filled. In seven days the Company must depart.' 
line 18867=>     The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade 
line 18868=>was traced  a device  of seven  stars set between the crescent Moon and  the 
line 18869=>rayed Sun,  and  about  them  was written  many  runes; for  Aragorn son  of 
line 18870=>Arathorn  was going to war upon the marches of Mordor. Very bright was  that 
line 18871=>sword  when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, 
line 18872=>and the light of the  moon shone cold, and its edge  was hard and  keen. And 
line 18873=>Aragorn gave it a new name and called it And®ril, Flame of the West. 
line 18874=>     Aragorn and Gandalf walked together  or sat speaking of  their road and 
line 18875=>the  perils they  would meet; and they pondered the storied and figured maps 
line 18876=>and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with 
line 18877=>them; but  he was content to  lean on their guidance,  and he spent  as much 
line 18878=>time as he could with Bilbo. 
line 18879=>     In those  last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall 
line 18880=>of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of Beren 
line 18881=>and L®thien and the winning of the  Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry 
line 18882=>and Pippin were out and about, Frodo and Sam were  to be found with Bilbo in 
line 18883=>his  own small  room.  Then Bilbo would  read  passages from his book (which 
line 18884=>still seemed very incomplete). or scraps of his verses, or  would take notes 
line 18885=>of Frodo's adventures.  
line 18886=>     On the morning of the last day Frodo  was alone with Bilbo, and the old 
line 18887=>hobbit  pulled  out from under his bed a wooden box.  He lifted  the lid and 
line 18888=>fumbled inside. 
line 18889=>     'Here  is your sword,' he said. 'But it was broken, you know. I took it 
line 18890=>to  keep it safe but I've  forgotten to ask if the smiths  could mend it. No 
line 18891=>time now..  So I thought, perhaps,  you would care to have this,  don't  you  
line 18892=>know?' 
line 18893=>     He took from the box  a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard.  
line 18894=>Then he drew it, and  its polished and well -tended blade glittered suddenly, 
line 18895=>
line 18896=>####-cold  and bright. 'This is Sting,' he said, and thrust it with little effort 
line 18897=>deep into a wooden beam. `Take it, if  you like.  I shan't want  it again, I 
line 18898=>expect.' 
line 18899=>     Frodo accepted it gratefully. 
line 18900=>     'Also there is this!' said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to 
line 18901=>be rather  heavy for  its size. He unwound several folds of  old cloth,  and 
line 18902=>held up a  small shirt of  mail. It was close-woven of many  rings, as supple 
line 18903=>almost as linen, cold as ice,  and  harder than steel. It shone like moonlit 
line 18904=>silver,  and  was studded  with white gems. With it  was a belt of pearl and 
line 18905=>crystal. 
line 18906=>     'It's  a pretty thing,  isn't it?'  said Bilbo, moving it in the light. 
line 18907=>`And  useful.  It  is my dwarf-mail that  Thorin gave me. I got it back from 
line 18908=>Michel Delving before I started,  and packed  it with my  luggage: I brought  
line 18909=>all the mementoes of my Journey away with me, except the Ring. But I did not 
line 18910=>expect to use this, and I don't need it  now, except to  look  at sometimes. 
line 18911=>You hardly feel any weight when you put it on.' 
line 18912=>     `I  should look -- well, I don't think I should look right in it,' said 
line 18913=>Frodo. 
line 18914=>     `Just what I sa id myself,' said Bilbo. 'But never mind about looks. You  
line 18915=>can wear it under your  outer clothes.  Come  on! You must share this secret  
line 18916=>with me. Don't tell anybody else! But I should  feel happier  if I knew  you  
line 18917=>were wearing it.  I have a fancy it would turn even the  knives of the Black  
line 18918=>Riders,' he ended in a low voice. 
line 18919=>     `Very  well, I will take  it,' said  Frodo. Bilbo  put  it  on him, and 
line 18920=>fastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo put over the top his 
line 18921=>old weather -stained breeches, tunic, and jacket. 
line 18922=>     'Just a  plain hobbit you  look,' said Bilbo.  'But there is more about 
line 18923=>you now than  appears  on the surface. Good luck to you!' He turned away and 
line 18924=>looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune. 
line 18925=>     'I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo,  for this, and for all our past  
line 18926=>kindnesses,' said Frodo. 
line 18927=>     'Don't try!' said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the 
line 18928=>back.  `Ow!' he cried. `You are  too  hard  now  to slap! But there you are: 
line 18929=>Hobbits must stick together, and especially  Bagginses. All I  ask in return 
line 18930=>is: take  as much care of yourself as you can. and  bring  back all the news 
line 18931=>you can, and  any old  songs and  tales you can come by. I'll do  my best to 
line 18932=>finish my book before you return. I should like to write the second book, if 
line 18933=>
line 18934=>####-I am spared.' He broke off and turned to the window again, singing softly. 
line 18935=> 
line 18936=>     I sit beside the fire and think 
line 18937=>     of all that I have seen, 
line 18938=>     of meadow-flowers and butterflies 
line 18939=>     in summers that have been; 
line 18940=> 
line 18941=>     Of yellow leaves and gossamer 
line 18942=>     in autumns that there were, 
line 18943=>     with morning mist and silver sun 
line 18944=>     and wind upon my hair. 
line 18945=> 
line 18946=>     I sit beside the fire and think 
line 18947=>     of how the world will be 
line 18948=>     when winter comes without a spring 
line 18949=>     that I shall ever see. 
line 18950=> 
line 18951=>     For still  there are so many things 
line 18952=>     that I have never seen: 
line 18953=>     in every wood in every spring 
line 18954=>     there is a different green. 
line 18955=> 
line 18956=>     I sit beside the fire and think 
line 18957=>     of people long ago, 
line 18958=>     and people who will see a world  
line 18959=>     that I shall never know.  
line 18960=> 
line 18961=>     But all the while I sit and think 
line 18962=>     of times there were before, 
line 18963=>     I listen for returning feet 
line 18964=>     and voices at the door. 
line 18965=> 
line 18966=>     It was  a  cold grey  day near the end of  December.  The East Wind was 
line 18967=>streaming through  the  bare branches of the trees, and seething in the dark 
line 18968=>pines on the hills. Ragged clouds  were hurrying overhead,  dark and low. As 
line 18969=>the cheerless shadows  of the early evening began  to  fall the Company made 
line 18970=>ready to set out. They were to start at dusk, for Elrond  counselled them to 
line 18971=>
line 18972=>####-journey  under cover  of night as often as  they could,  until they were far 
line 18973=>from Rivendell. 
line 18974=>     `You should fear the many eyes  of the servants of Sauron,' he said. 'I  
line 18975=>do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders has already reached 
line 18976=>him,  and he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies on foot  and  wing  
line 18977=>will be abroad in the northern lands. Even of the  sky above you must beware 
line 18978=>as you go on your way.' 
line 18979=>     The Company took little gear of war,  for their hope was in secrecy not 
line 18980=>in battle. Aragorn had And®ril  but no other weapon, and he went  forth clad 
line 18981=>only in rusty green and brown. as a  Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a 
line 18982=>long sword,  in fashion like And®ril but of less  lineage and he bore also a  
line 18983=>shield and his war-horn. 
line 18984=>     'Loud and  clear it sounds  in the valleys of the hills,' he said, `and 
line 18985=>then  let all the foes  of Gondor  flee!' Putting  it to  his lips he blew a  
line 18986=>blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice 
line 18987=>in Rivendell sprang to their feet. 
line 18988=>     Slow  should you  be to  wind  that  horn again,  Boromir, said Elrond. 
line 18989=>'until you stand once more on the  borders of your land, and dire need is on 
line 18990=>you.' 
line 18991=>     `Maybe,' said Boromir.  'But always I have let my  horn cry  at setting 
line 18992=>forth, and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows, I will not go forth 
line 18993=>as a thief in the night.' 
line 18994=>     Gimli the  dwarf alone wore  openly  a short shirt of steel-rings,  for  
line 18995=>dwarves make  light  of burdens;  and in  his  belt was a  broad-bladed axe. 
line 18996=>Legolas had  a bow and a  quiver,  and  at his belt a long  white knife. The 
line 18997=>younger  hobbits wore the swords that they had  taken  from the  barrow; but 
line 18998=>Frodo took only Sting;  and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. 
line 18999=>Gandalf bore his staff, but girt at his side was  the elven-sword Glamdring, 
line 19000=>the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon  the breast of Thorin under the Lonely 
line 19001=>Mountain. 
line 19002=>     All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had 
line 19003=>jackets and cloaks lined with  fur. Spare food and clothes  and blankets and 
line 19004=>other needs were laden on a  pony, none other  than the poor beast that they 
line 19005=>had brought from Bree. 
line 19006=>     ?he stay  in Rivendell had  worked a  great wonder of change on him: he 
line 19007=>was  glossy and seemed  to  have  the vigour of youth.  It  was  Sam who had 
line 19008=>insisted on choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine, 
line 19009=>
line 19010=>####-if he did not come. 
line 19011=>     `That  animal can nearly talk,' he said, `and  would talk, if he stayed 
line 19012=>here  much longer. He gave me a  look as plain as Mr. Pippin could speak it: 
line 19013=>if you don't  let me go  with you, Sam, I'll follow  on my own.' So Bill was 
line 19014=>going as the beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the Company that 
line 19015=>did not seem depressed. 
line 19016=>     Their  farewells had been  said in the great hall by the  fire, and they 
line 19017=>were only waiting now for  Gandalf, who had not yet come out of the house. A 
line 19018=>gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in 
line 19019=>many windows. Bilbo  huddled in a cloak stood silent  on the doorstep beside 
line 19020=>Frodo.  Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully 
line 19021=>what this hour meant to him. The others could be seen as grey  shapes in the 
line 19022=>darkness.  
line 19023=>     Sam was  standing by the  pony, sucking  his teeth, and staring moodily 
line 19024=>into  the  gloom  where  the  river  roared  stonily below;  his  desire for  
line 19025=>adventure was at its lowest ebb. 
line 19026=>     `Bill,  my lad,' he said,  `you oughtn't to have took up  with us.  You  
line 19027=>could have stayed here and et the best hay  till the  new grass comes.' Bill 
line 19028=>swished his tail and said nothing. 
line 19029=>     Sam  eased the pack on  his shoulders, and  went over anxiously  in his 
line 19030=>mind all the things that he had stowed in it,  wondering if he had forgotten 
line 19031=>anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the  little  box of salt 
line 19032=>that he  always carried  and  refilled  when he  could;  a  good  supply  of 
line 19033=>pipe-weed (but not near enough,  I'll  warrant); flint  and tinder;  woollen 
line 19034=>hose:  linen;  various  small  belongings  of his  master's that  Frodo  had 
line 19035=>forgotten and Sam had  stowed to  bring them out in  triumph when they  were 
line 19036=>called for. He went through them all. 
line 19037=>     'Rope!'  he  muttered. `No  rope!  And  only  last night  you  said  to 
line 19038=>yourself: "Sam, what about a bit of rope? You'll want it, if you haven't got 
line 19039=>it:" Well, I'll wa nt it. I can't get it now.' 
line 19040=>     At that moment Elrond came out with  Gandalf, and he called the Company 
line 19041=>to him. 'This is my last  word,' he said in a low voice. 'The Ring-bearer is 
line 19042=>setting  out on the Quest  of  Mount Doom. On him  alone is any charge laid: 
line 19043=>neither to cast away the Ring, nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy 
line 19044=>nor  indeed to  let any  handle  it,  save  members of  the Company  and the 
line 19045=>Council,  and  only then in  gravest need. The others  go  with him  as free 
line 19046=>companions,  to help him on his way.  You may tarry,  or come back, or  turn 
line 19047=>
line 19048=>####-aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you  go, the less easy 
line 19049=>will it be  to  withdraw; yet  no oath or bond is  laid on you to go further  
line 19050=>than you will. For you do not yet know the strength of  your hearts, and you  
line 19051=>cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road.' 
line 19052=>     `Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,' said Gimli. 
line 19053=>     'Maybe,' said Elrond, `but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has 
line 19054=>not seen the nightfall. ' 
line 19055=>     'Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,' said Gimli. 
line 19056=>     `Or  break it,' said Elrond. `Look  not too far ahead! But  go now with 
line 19057=>good hearts!  Farewell, and may the  blessing of Elves and Men and  all Free 
line 19058=>Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!' 
line 19059=>     'Good . . . good luck!' cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold. 'I don't 
line 19060=>suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad, but I shall expect a  
line 19061=>full account when you get back. And don't be too long! Farewell!' 
line 19062=>     Many other s of Elrond's household stood in the shadows and watched them 
line 19063=>go, bidding them farewell  with soft  voices. There was no laughter, and  no  
line 19064=>song or music. At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk. 
line 19065=>     They crossed  the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths  that 
line 19066=>led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came at length to the high 
line 19067=>moor where the wind hissed through the  heather. Then with one glance at the 
line 19068=>Last Homely House twinkling below them they strode away far into the night. 
line 19069=>     At  the  Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went 
line 19070=>on  by  narrow paths  among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this 
line 19071=>course west of the Mountains  for many  miles and days. The country was 
line 19072=>much 
line 19073=>rougher  and  mor e barren  than  in  the  green vale of the  Great River  in 
line 19074=>Wilderland  on the other side of the range,  and  their going would be slow;  
line 19075=>but  they hoped  in  this way to  escape the notice of unfriendly  eyes. The 
line 19076=>spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country, and the 
line 19077=>paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell.  
line 19078=>     Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this  land 
line 19079=>even  in the dark.  The  others were in file behind, and  Legolas whose eyes 
line 19080=>were keen was the rearguard.  The first  part of their  journey was hard and 
line 19081=>dreary, and Frodo remembered little  of it, save the wind. For many  sunless 
line 19082=>days an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed 
line 19083=>able  to keep out its searching fingers.  Though the Company was  well clad, 
line 19084=>they  seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during 
line 19085=>
line 19086=>####-the middle of  the day,  in some  hollow of the land,  or  hidden under  the 
line 19087=>tangled  thorn-bushes  that  grew in  thickets in many places. In  the  late 
line 19088=>afternoon they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and 
line 19089=>cheerless as  a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting of a  fire. In 
line 19090=>the  evening  they went on again, always  as nearly  southward as they could 
line 19091=>find a  way. 
line 19092=>     At  first  it seemed  to  the hobbits  that  although  they walked  and 
line 19093=>stumbled until  they were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and  
line 19094=>getting nowhere. Each  day  the land looked much the same as  it had the day 
line 19095=>before. Yet steadily the  mountains were drawing nearer. South  of Rivendell 
line 19096=>they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the  feet  of the  main 
line 19097=>range there was tumbled an ever  wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys 
line 19098=>filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding, and led them often  
line 19099=>only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps.  
line 19100=>     They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind 
line 19101=>suddenly fell and then  veered round to  the south. The swift -flowing clouds 
line 19102=>lifted and melted away, and the sun came out,  pale and bright. There came a 
line 19103=>cold clear dawn  at the  end of a long stumbling night-march. The travellers 
line 19104=>reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly -trees whose grey-green trunks 
line 19105=>seemed to have  been  bu ilt  out of the very  stone of the hills. Their dark 
line 19106=>leaves shone and their berries glowed red in the light of the rising sun. 
line 19107=>     Away  in the  south Frodo could  see the  dim shapes of lofty mountains 
line 19108=>that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company was taking. At the 
line 19109=>left of this high  range rose three peaks; the  tallest and nearest stood up 
line 19110=>like a tooth tipped with snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still 
line 19111=>largely  in the  shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon  it,  it glowed 
line 19112=>red. 
line 19113=>     Gandalf stood  at Frodo's side and  looked out under his hand. `We have 
line 19114=>done well,' he said.  `We have reached the borders of the country  that  Men 
line 19115=>call Hollin; many Elves lived here  in happier  days,  when Eregion was  its 
line 19116=>name.  Five-and-forty leagues as the crow flies we  have come,  though  many 
line 19117=>long miles further our feet  have walked. The land and the weather  will  be 
line 19118=>milder now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.' 
line 19119=>     `Dangerous or  not, a  real sunrise  is  mighty  welcome,'  said Frodo, 
line 19120=>throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall on his face. 
line 19121=>     'But the mountains  are ahead of us,' said Pippin. `We must have turned 
line 19122=>eastwards in the night.' 
line 19123=>
line 19124=>####-     'No,'  said Gandalf. 'But you  see further ahead in  the  clear  light. 
line 19125=>Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. There are  many maps 
line 19126=>in 
line 19127=>Elrond's house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?' 
line 19128=>     `Yes I did, sometimes,' said Pippin, `but I don't remember them.  Frodo 
line 19129=>has a better head for that sort of thing.' 
line 19130=>     `I need no map,' said  Gimli, who  had come  up  with Legolas,  and was 
line 19131=>gazing out before him with a strange  light in his deep eyes. `There is  the 
line 19132=>land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those 
line 19133=>mountains  into many works of metal  and of  stone, and into  many songs and 
line 19134=>tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathyr. 
line 19135=>     `Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know 
line 19136=>them and their names, for under them lies  Khazad-dym, the Dwarrowdelf, that 
line 19137=>is  now  called  the Black Pit,  Moria in the Elvish  tongue.  Yonder stands 
line 19138=>Barazinbar, the  Redhorn, cruel Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and 
line 19139=>Cloudyhead: Celebdil  the  White,  and  Fanuidhol  the Grey,  that  we  call 
line 19140=>Zirak-zigil and Bundushathyr. 
line 19141=>     `There the  Misty  Mountains  divide, and between  their  arms lies the 
line 19142=>deep-shadowed valley  which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale, 
line 19143=>which the Elves call Nanduhirion.' 
line 19144=>     `It is for the Dimrill Dale  that we are  making,' said Gandalf. `If we 
line 19145=>climb  the  pass that  is called the Redhorn Gate, under  the  far  side  of 
line 19146=>Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the  
line 19147=>Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere, and there the River Silverlode rises  in 
line 19148=>its icy springs.' 
line 19149=>     `Dark is  the water  of  Kheled-zvram,' said Gimli, `and  cold are  the 
line 19150=>springs of Kibil-nvla. My  heart trembles at the thought that I may see them 
line 19151=>soon.' 
line 19152=>     `May you have  joy of the sight, my good  dwarf  l' said  Gandalf.   'But 
line 19153=>whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down 
line 19154=>the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so  to the Great  River,  and then  
line 19155=>--' 
line 19156=>     He paused. 
line 19157=>     'Yes, and where then?' asked Merry. 
line 19158=>     'To the end of the  journey -- in the  end,' said  Gandalf.  'We cannot 
line 19159=>look too  far ahead. Let us be glad that  the first stage is safely over.  I 
line 19160=>think we  will rest here, not only today but  tonight as  well. There  is  a  
line 19161=>
line 19162=>####-wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly 
line 19163=>forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there.' 
line 19164=>     'That is true,' said Legolas. `But  the Elves of  this land  were of  a  
line 19165=>race strange to  us  of the  silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not 
line 19166=>now remember them: Only I hear the stones  lament them: deep they delved us, 
line 19167=>fair  they wrought  us,  high they  builded us;  but they are gone. They are 
line 19168=>gone. They sought the Havens long ago.' 
line 19169=>     That morning they lit a fire in a deep  hollow shrouded by great bushes 
line 19170=>of holly, and their supper -breakfast was merrier than it had been since they 
line 19171=>set out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all 
line 19172=>the  night  to sleep  in, and they  did not  mean to go  on again until  the 
line 19173=>evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless. After a while 
line 19174=>he left the Company  and  wandered on  to the ridge; there he stood  in  the 
line 19175=>shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and  westwards, with his head posed 
line 19176=>as if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and look ed 
line 19177=>down at the others laughing and talking. 
line 19178=>     `What  is the  matter, Strider?' Merry called up. 'What are you looking 
line 19179=>for? Do you miss the East Wind?' 
line 19180=>     'No  indeed,' he answered. `But I miss  something. I  have been in  the 
line 19181=>country  of  Hollin in many seasons. No folk  dwell here now, but many other  
line 19182=>creatures live here at  all times, especially birds. Yet now all  things but 
line 19183=>you are silent. I  can feel it.  There is no sound for miles about  us,  and 
line 19184=>your voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.' 
line 19185=>     Gandalf looked  up with  sudden interest. `But what do you guess is the 
line 19186=>reason?' he asked.  `Is  there  more  in  it  than  surprise  at seeing four 
line 19187=>hobbits, not to mention  the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen  or  
line 19188=>heard?' 
line 19189=>     `I  hope  that  is  it,'  answered Aragorn.  `But I  have  a  sense  of 
line 19190=>watchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.' 
line 19191=>     "Then we  must be more careful,' said Gandalf.  'If you bring a  Ranger  
line 19192=>with you, it  is well  to pay attention to  him, especially if the Ranger is 
line 19193=>Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.' 
line 19194=>     It was Sam's turn that day  to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined 
line 19195=>him. The others  fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even  Sam felt it. 
line 19196=>The breathing  of  the  sleepers could be  plainly heard.  The swish  of the 
line 19197=>pony's tail and the occasional movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam 
line 19198=>could hear his own joints creaking, if  he  stirred. Dead silence was around 
line 19199=>
line 19200=>####-him, and  over all  hung a  clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East. 
line 19201=>Away  in the South  a dark patch appeared,  and grew,  and  drove north like 
line 19202=>flying smoke in the wind. 
line 19203=>     `What's  that, Strider? It don't look  like  a  cloud,' said  Sam  in a  
line 19204=>whisper to  Aragorn. He made no  answer, he was gazing  intently at the sky; 
line 19205=>but  before long  Sam could see for himself what was  approaching. Flocks of 
line 19206=>birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all 
line 19207=>the  land as if they  were searching for  something; and they  were steadily 
line 19208=>drawing nearer. 
line 19209=>     `Lie  flat and still!' hissed  Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade 
line 19210=>of a holly-bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from 
line 19211=>the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought 
line 19212=>they were a kind of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense 
line 19213=>a throng that their shadow followed them  darkly over the  ground below, one 
line 19214=>harsh croak was heard. 
line 19215=>     Not until they had  dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the 
line 19216=>sky was again  clear  would  Aragorn rise. Then he  sprang  up and  went and 
line 19217=>wakened Gandalf. 
line 19218=>     `Regiments of  black  crows  are  flying over all  the land between the 
line 19219=>Mountains  and the Greyflood,'  he said, `and  they have passed over Hollin.  
line 19220=>They are not natives here; they are crebain  out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do 
line 19221=>not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from 
line 19222=>which they are  fleeing; but  I  think  they are spying out the land. I have 
line 19223=>also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think we ought to move 
line 19224=>again this  evening.  Hollin is no  longer wholesome  for  us: it  is  being 
line 19225=>watched.' 
line 19226=>     `And in that case so is the Redhorn  Gate,' said Gandalf;  `and how  we 
line 19227=>can get over that withou t being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of 
line 19228=>that when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you  
line 19229=>are right.' 
line 19230=>     `Luckily our fire made  little smoke,  and  had  burned  low before the 
line 19231=>crebain  came,' said Aragorn. `It must be put out and not lit again.' 
line 19232=>     `Well if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!' said Pippin. The news: no 
line 19233=>fire, and a move again  by night, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke 
line 19234=>in the late afternoon. 'All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward 
line 19235=>to a real good meal tonight: something hot.' 
line 19236=>     `Well, you can go on looking forward,' said Gandalf. `There may be many 
line 19237=>
line 19238=>####-unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in 
line 19239=>comfort,  and warmer feet. However, we are certain of one thing at any rate: 
line 19240=>it will get warmer as we get south.' 
line 19241=>     'Too  warm, I  shouldn't  wonder,'  muttered  Sam  to  Frodo. 'But  I'm 
line 19242=>beginning to think it's time we got  a sight of that Fiery Mountain  and saw 
line 19243=>the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that this here Redhorn, 
line 19244=>or  whatever its  name is, might  be it, till Gimli spoke his piece.  A fair 
line 19245=>jaw-cracker dwarf-language  must be!' Maps  conveyed nothing  to Sam's mind, 
line 19246=>and all  distances in  these strange lands  seemed so vast that he was quite 
line 19247=>out of his reckoning. 
line 19248=>     All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over  
line 19249=>now  and  again;  but  as  the  westering  Sun  grew  red  they  disappeared 
line 19250=>southwards. At dusk  the  Company set out, and  turning  now half  east they 
line 19251=>steered their course towards  Caradhras, which far away still glowed faintly 
line 19252=>red  in the last  light of the vanished Sun. One  by one  white stars sprang 
line 19253=>forth as the sky faded. 
line 19254=>     Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo   like the 
line 19255=>remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad and  well planned, from 
line 19256=>Hollin to the  mountain -pass.  The  Moon, now  at the  full,  rose  over the 
line 19257=>mountains, and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stones were  black. 
line 19258=>Many  of  them looked  to  have been worked by hands, though  now  they  lay 
line 19259=>tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren land. 
line 19260=>     It  was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon 
line 19261=>was low. Frodo looked  up at the sky. Suddenly  he saw or felt a shadow  pass 
line 19262=>over the high  stars, as  if for a  moment they faded  and  then flashed out 
line 19263=>again. He shivered. 
line 19264=>     `Did you see anything pass over?' he whispered to Gandalf, who was just  
line 19265=>ahead. 
line 19266=>     `No, but I felt it, whatever  it was,' he answered. `It may be nothing, 
line 19267=>only a wisp of thin cloud.' 
line 19268=>     `It was moving fast then,' muttered Aragorn, `and not with the wind.' 
line 19269=>     Nothing  further  happened  that  night.  The next morning  dawned even  
line 19270=>brighter  than  before.  But the air was chill  again; already  the wind was 
line 19271=>turning back towards the east. For two more nights they marched on, climbing 
line 19272=>steadily but ever more slowly as their road wound up into the hills, and the 
line 19273=>mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose 
line 19274=>before  them, a mighty peak, tipped with  snow  like silver, but with  sheer  
line 19275=>
line 19276=>####-naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood. 
line 19277=>     There was a  black look in the sky, and  the sun was wan. The  wind had 
line 19278=>gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the air and looked ba ck. 
line 19279=>     `Winter deepens behind us,' he said quietly to  Aragorn.  'The  heights 
line 19280=>away  north  are whiter  than  they  were;  snow  is  lying far  down  their 
line 19281=>shoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up  towards the Redhorn Gate. 
line 19282=>We  may well be seen  by watchers  on that narrow path,  and waylaid by some 
line 19283=>evil;  but the weather may prove a  more deadly enemy than any. What  do you  
line 19284=>think of your course now, Aragorn?' 
line 19285=>     Frodo overheard  these  words, and understood that  Gandalf and Aragorn 
line 19286=>were  continuing  some  debate  that  had  begun  long before.  He  listened 
line 19287=>anxiously. 
line 19288=>     'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, 
line 19289=>Gandalf,' answered Aragorn. `And perils known and unknown will grow as we 
line 19290=>go 
line 19291=>on. But we must  go on; and it is no good our  delaying  the passage  of the 
line 19292=>mountains. Further south  there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap  of 
line 19293=>Rohan.  I do not trust  that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows 
line 19294=>which 
line 19295=>side now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?' 
line 19296=>     'Who knows indeed!' said Gandalf. `But there is another way, and not by  
line 19297=>the pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that we have spoken of.' 
line 19298=>     'But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others I 
line 19299=>beg, not until it is plain tha t there is no other way.' 
line 19300=>     'We must decide before we go further,' answered Gandalf. 
line 19301=>     'Then let us weigh  the matter in our  minds, while the others rest and 
line 19302=>sleep,' said Aragorn. 
line 19303=>     In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, 
line 19304=>Gandalf and Aragorn  went aside together and stood looking at Caradhras. Its 
line 19305=>sides  were now dark  and sullen, and  its head  was in  grey  cloud.  Frodo 
line 19306=>watched them, wondering which way the debate would go. When they returned 
line 19307=>to 
line 19308=>the Company Ganda lf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face 
line 19309=>the weather and the high  pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was 
line 19310=>the other dark and secret way, but the very mention of it had seemed to fill 
line 19311=>Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned. 
line 19312=>     `From signs that we have  seen lately,' said Gandalf,  'I fear that the 
line 19313=>
line 19314=>####-Redhorn Gate may be  watched; and also  I have doubts of the weather that is 
line 19315=>coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go  with all the speed that we 
line 19316=>can. 
line 19317=>Even so it will take us more than two marches before we reach the top of the  
line 19318=>pass.  Dark will come early this evening. We must leave  as  soon as you can 
line 19319=>get ready.' 
line 19320=>     'I will  add a  word of  advice, if I  may,'  said Boromir. 'I was born 
line 19321=>under the shadow of the White Mountains and  know  something of journeys  
line 19322=>in 
line 19323=>the high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down 
line 19324=>on the other side. It will not help  us to keep so secret that we are frozen 
line 19325=>to death. When we leave here, where  there are still a few trees and bushes,  
line 19326=>each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.' 
line 19327=>     'And Bill could take a bit more, couldn't  you lad?' said Sam. The pony 
line 19328=>looked at him mournfully. 
line 19329=>     'Very well,' said Gandalf. `But we must not  use the wood -- not unless 
line 19330=>it is a choice between fire and death.' 
line 19331=>     The Company set out again with good speed at first; but soon their  way 
line 19332=>became steep  and  difficult.  The twisting  and climbing road  had  in many  
line 19333=>places almost disappeared, and was  blocked  with  many fallen  stones.  The 
line 19334=>night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A  bitter wind swirled among  the 
line 19335=>rocks. By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The 
line 19336=>narrow path now wound  under a sheer wall of cliffs to the left, above which  
line 19337=>the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right  
line 19338=>was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine. 
line 19339=>     Laboriously they climbed a  sharp slope and halted for a  moment at the 
line 19340=>top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim 
line 19341=>white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve. 
line 19342=>     They went on. But before  long the snow was falling fast,  filling  all 
line 19343=>the air, and swirling into Frodo's eyes. The dark bent shapes of Gandalf and 
line 19344=>Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen. 
line 19345=>     'I don't like this at all,' panted Sam  just behind.  'Snow's all right 
line 19346=>on a fine morning,  but I like to be in  bed while it's falling. I wish this 
line 19347=>lot would  go off to Hobbiton! Folk  might  welcome  it there.' Except on the 
line 19348=>high moors of the Northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the Shire,  and was 
line 19349=>regarded as  a pleasant event and  a chance for fun. No  living hobbit (save 
line 19350=>
line 19351=>####-Bilbo) could remember the Fell Winter of 1311, when the white wolves 
line 19352=>invaded 
line 19353=>the Shire over the frozen Brandywine. 
line 19354=>     Gandalf  halted. Snow  was  thick on  his  hood and  shoulders;  it was 
line 19355=>already ankle-deep about his boots.  
line 19356=>     "This is what I feared,' he said. `What do you say now, Aragorn?' 
line 19357=>     'That I feared  it too,' Aragorn answered, `but less than other things. 
line 19358=>I knew the  risk of  snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save 
line 19359=>high up in the mountains. But we are not  high yet;  we are still  far down, 
line 19360=>where the paths are usually open all the winter.' 
line 19361=>     'I wonder if this  is a contrivance  of the Enemy,' said Boromir. "They 
line 19362=>say in my land that he can govern the storms in the Mountains of Shadow that 
line 19363=>stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and many allies.' 
line 19364=>     'His arm  has grown long indeed,' said Gimli, `if he can draw snow down 
line 19365=>from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues away.' 
line 19366=>     'His arm has grown long,' said Gandalf. 
line 19367=>     While  they  were halted,  the wind died  down, and the snow  slackened 
line 19368=>until  it almost ceased. They tramped on again.  But they had not  gone more 
line 19369=>than a  furlong when the storm returned with fresh  fury. The  wind whistled 
line 19370=>and  the snow became a blinding blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard to 
line 19371=>keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind  the taller 
line 19372=>folk, but it was  plain  that they could not  go much  further,  if the snow 
line 19373=>continued.  Frodo's  feet felt like lead. Pippin  was dragging behind.  Even 
line 19374=>Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged. 
line 19375=>     The Company  halted  suddenly, as if  they  had  come  to  an agreement 
line 19376=>without any words  being  spoken. They  heard eerie noises in  the  darkness 
line 19377=>round them.  It may have been only a  trick of  the wind in  the cracks  and 
line 19378=>gullies  of the  rocky wall, but the sounds were those of shrill  cries, and 
line 19379=>wild  howls  of  laughter.  Stones  began  to  fall  from the mountain-side, 
line 19380=>whistling over  their heads, or crashing on the path beside them. Every  now 
line 19381=>and  again they heard a dull  rumble,  as a gr eat  boulder rolled  down from 
line 19382=>hidden heights above. 
line 19383=>     `We cannot go further  tonight,' said Boromir. `Let those  call it  the 
line 19384=>wind who will; there are fell voices on the  air; and these stones are aimed 
line 19385=>at us.' 
line 19386=>     `I do call it the wind,' said Aragor n. `But that does not make what you  
line 19387=>say untrue. There are many evil and unfriendly things in the world that have 
line 19388=>
line 19389=>####-little  love for those that go on two legs, and  yet are not in  league with 
line 19390=>Sauron, but have purposes of  their own. Some have been in this world longer  
line 19391=>than he.' 
line 19392=>     'Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name, said Gimli, `long 
line 19393=>years ago, when rumour of Sauron had not been heard in these lands.' 
line 19394=>     `It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off  his attack; 
line 19395=>said Gandalf. 
line 19396=>     'But what can we do?'  cried Pippin miserably. He  was leaning on Merry 
line 19397=>and Frodo, and he was shivering. 
line 19398=>     `Either stop where we are, or  go back,' said Gandalf.  'It is no  good 
line 19399=>going on. Only a little higher, if I remember rightly,  this path leaves the 
line 19400=>cliff  and  runs into  a wide  shallow trough at the bottom of a  long  hard 
line 19401=>slope. We should  have no shelter there  from snow, or stones  -- or anything  
line 19402=>else.' 
line 19403=>     `And it is no good going back while the storm holds,' said Aragorn. `We 
line 19404=>have  pa ssed  no place on the way up that  offered  more  shelter  than this 
line 19405=>cliff-wall we are under now.' 
line 19406=>     `Shelter!' muttered Sam. `If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof 
line 19407=>make a house.' 
line 19408=>     The Company now gathered together  as close to the cliff as  they could. 
line 19409=>It faced  southwards, and near the bottom it leaned  out  a little, so  that 
line 19410=>they hoped it would give  them some protection  from  the northerly wind and 
line 19411=>from the falling  stones. But eddying blasts swirled  round them from  every 
line 19412=>side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds. 
line 19413=>     They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood 
line 19414=>patiently but dejectedly in  front  of  the  hobbits,  and  screened  them a  
line 19415=>little; but before long the  drifting snow was above his  hocks, and it went 
line 19416=>on mounting. If they had had no  larger companions the  hobbits  would  soon 
line 19417=>have been entirely buried. 
line 19418=>     A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a  
line 19419=>warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes,  and out of the 
line 19420=>shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo's voice  speaking.  I 
line 19421=>don't think much of your diary , he  said. Snowstorms on January the twelfth: 
line 19422=>there was no need to come back to report that! 
line 19423=>     But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo, Frodo answered with an effort, when 
line 19424=>he  felt  himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. Boromir 
line 19425=>had lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow. 
line 19426=>
line 19427=>####-     `This will be the death  of the halflings, Gandalf,'  said Boromir. `It 
line 19428=>is useless  to sit  here until the  snow goes  over  our heads.  We must  do 
line 19429=>something to save ourselves.' 
line 19430=>     `Give them this,' said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a  
line 19431=>leathern flask. `Just a mouthful each -- for all of us. It is very precious. 
line 19432=>It is miruvor, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting. 
line 19433=>Pass it round!' 
line 19434=>     As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor  
line 19435=>he felt a new strength of heart, and the  heavy drowsiness  left  his limbs.  
line 19436=>The  others a lso  revived and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow  did  
line 19437=>not  relent. It whirled about  them thicker  than  ever, and the  wind  blew 
line 19438=>louder. 
line 19439=>     'What do  you say to fire?' asked Boromir  suddenly. 'The  choice seems 
line 19440=>near now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we shall be hidden  from 
line 19441=>all unfriendly eyes when the  snow has covered us,  but that  will not  help 
line 19442=>us.' 
line 19443=>     'You may make a fire,  if you can,' answered Gandalf. 'If there are any 
line 19444=>watchers that can endure this storm, then they  can see us, fire or no.' But 
line 19445=>though they had  brought wood and kindlings by  the  advice  of Boromir,  it  
line 19446=>passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike a flame that would hold amid 
line 19447=>the swirling wind or catch  in  the  wet fuel.  At  last reluctantly Gandalf 
line 19448=>himself took a hand. Picking  up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and 
line 19449=>then with a word of command, naur an edraith ammen! he thrust the end of his 
line 19450=>staff into  the midst of it.  At once a great spout  of green and blue flame 
line 19451=>sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered. 
line 19452=>     `If there  are any  to  see, then I at  least am revealed to  them,' he 
line 19453=>said. 'I have  written Gandalf  is  here  in signs  that all  can  read from 
line 19454=>Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.' 
line 19455=>     But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly  eyes. Their  
line 19456=>hearts were rejoiced to see  the light of the fire. The wood burned merrily; 
line 19457=>and though  all round it  the  snow  hissed, and pools of  slush crept under  
line 19458=>their feet, they warmed  their hands gladly at the  blaze. There they stood,  
line 19459=>stooping  in  a circle round the little  dancing and  blowing flames. A  red 
line 19460=>light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind them the night was like a  
line 19461=>black wall. 
line 19462=>     But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell. 
line 19463=>     The fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on. 
line 19464=>
line 19465=>####-     The night is getting old,' said Aragorn. "The dawn is not far off.' 
line 19466=>     `If any dawn can pierce these clouds,' said Gimli. 
line 19467=>     Boromir  stepped  out of the  circle and stared up into  the blackness.  
line 19468=>'The snow is growing less,' he said, `and the wind is quieter.' 
line 19469=>     Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes  still  falling out of the dark to be 
line 19470=>revealed white  for a moment in the light of the dying fire;  but for a long 
line 19471=>time he could see no sign of their slackening. Then suddenly,  as sleep  was 
line 19472=>beginning to creep over him again, he  was aware that  the  wind had  indeed  
line 19473=>fallen,  and the flakes were  becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly  a  dim 
line 19474=>light began to grow. At last the snow stopped altogether. 
line 19475=>     As the   light grew stronger  it showed  a silent shrouded world.  Below 
line 19476=>their refuge  were white  humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath  which 
line 19477=>the path  that they had trodden was  altogether lost;  but the heights above 
line 19478=>were hidden in great clouds still heavy with the threat of snow.  
line 19479=>     Gimli looked up and shook his head. `Caradhras has not forgiven us.' he 
line 19480=>said.  `He has more snow yet to fling at  us, if we go on.  The sooner we go 
line 19481=>back and down the better.' 
line 19482=>     To this all agreed, but their retreat  was  now difficult. It might well 
line 19483=>prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay 
line 19484=>many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it  had been 
line 19485=>scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff. 
line 19486=>     `If  Gandalf  would go before us with  a bright  flame, he might melt a  
line 19487=>path for you,' said Legolas. The storm had troubled him little, and he alone 
line 19488=>of the Company remained still light of heart. 
line 19489=>     `If Elves could fly over mountains, they  might fetch  the Sun  to save  
line 19490=>us,' answered Gandalf. `But I must have something to work on.  I cannot burn 
line 19491=>snow.' 
line 19492=>     `Well,' said Boromir, `when heads are  at a  loss bodies must serve, as 
line 19493=>we say in my  country. The strongest of us must seek a  way. See! Though all 
line 19494=>is  now snow-clad,  our path, as  we came up, turned about that shoulder  of 
line 19495=>rock down yonder. It was there that the snow first began to burden us. If we 
line 19496=>could  reach that point, maybe it would prove easier  beyond. It  is no more 
line 19497=>than a furlong off, I guess. ' 
line 19498=>     `Then let us force a path thither, you and I!' said Aragorn. 
line 19499=>     Aragorn was the  tallest of the  Company, but  Boromir, little less  in 
line 19500=>height, was  broader and heavier  in  build.  He led  the  way,  and Aragorn 
line 19501=>followed  him.  Slowly  they  moved off, and were soon  toiling heavily.  In 
line 19502=>
line 19503=>####-places the snow was breast -high, and often Boromir  seemed to bc swimming 
line 19504=>or 
line 19505=>burrowing with his great arms rather than walking. 
line 19506=>     Legolas watched  them for a while with a smile upon his lips,  and then 
line 19507=>he turned to the others. `The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: 
line 19508=>let a ploughman plough,  but choose an otter for swimming, and  for  running 
line 19509=>light over grass and leaf or over snow-an Elf.' 
line 19510=>     With that he sprang forth nimbly, and  then Frodo noticed as if for the 
line 19511=>first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf had no boots, but wore 
line 19512=>only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint  in the 
line 19513=>snow. 
line 19514=>     'Farewell!' he said to Gandalf. `I go to find the Sun!' Then swift as a  
line 19515=>runner over  firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men,  
line 19516=>with a  wave of his hand he passed them,  and  sped into  the  distance, and 
line 19517=>vanished round the rocky turn. 
line 19518=>     The others  waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragor n 
line 19519=>dwindled into black specks  in the whiteness. At length they too passed from  
line 19520=>sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow 
line 19521=>came curling down again. 
line 19522=>     An hour, maybe,  went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last 
line 19523=>they  saw  Legolas  coming  back.  At  the  same time  Boromir  and  Aragorn 
line 19524=>reappeared round the bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope. 
line 19525=>     `Well,' cried Legolas as he ran up, `I have not brought the Sun. She is 
line 19526=>walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little wreath of snow on this 
line 19527=>Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam  of 
line 19528=>good hope for  those who are doomed  to  go on feet. There  is  the greatest  
line 19529=>wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost  
line 19530=>buried. They despaired, until I  returned and told them  that the  drift was 
line 19531=>little wider  than  a wall. And on  the  other  side the snow suddenly grows 
line 19532=>less,  while further down  it  is no  more than  a white coverlet  to cool a  
line 19533=>hobbit's toes.' 
line 19534=>     `Ah, it is as I  said,' growled Gimli. 'It was no ordinary storm. It is 
line 19535=>the  ill  will of Caradhras. He  does not love Elves and  Dwarves, and  that 
line 19536=>drift was laid to cut off our escape.' 
line 19537=>     'But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you  have Men with you,' 
line 19538=>said Boromir, who came up at that moment. `And doughty Men too, if I may 
line 19539=>say 
line 19540=>
line 19541=>####-it; though lesser  men with spades might have served you  better.  Still, we 
line 19542=>have thrust a lane through the  drift; and for that all here may be grateful 
line 19543=>who cannot run as light as Elves.' 
line 19544=>     `But  how are we  to get down there, even  if  you have cut through the 
line 19545=>drift?' said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits.  
line 19546=>     'Have  hope!' said Boromir. 'I am weary, but I still have some strength 
line 19547=>left, and  Aragorn too. We  will  bear the  little folk. The others no doubt 
line 19548=>will make shift  to tread the path behind  us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will 
line 19549=>begin with you.' 
line 19550=>     He lifted  up  the hobbit. 'Cling to  my back! I shall need my arms' he 
line 19551=>said and  strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind. Pippin marvelled at 
line 19552=>his  strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with  no  other  
line 19553=>tool than his great limbs. Even now, burdened as he was, he was widening the 
line 19554=>track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went. 
line 19555=>     They  came  at length  to  the  great drift.  It  was  flung across the 
line 19556=>mountain-path like a  sheer  and sudden  wall, and  its  crest, sharp as  if 
line 19557=>shaped with  knives,  reared up more than twice the  height of  Boromir; but 
line 19558=>through the middle  a passage had been  beaten, rising  and falling  like  a  
line 19559=>bridge.  On  the  far  side Merry  and Pippin were set down, and there  they 
line 19560=>waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive. 
line 19561=>     After a  while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in  the narrow but 
line 19562=>now well-trodden track came Gandalf,  leading  Bill with Gimli perched among 
line 19563=>the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane; 
line 19564=>but hardly had Frodo touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled 
line 19565=>down a fall of stones and slithering  snow. The spray of it half blinded the 
line 19566=>Company as they crouched against the cliff,  and  when the air cleared again 
line 19567=>they saw that the path was blocked behind them. 
line 19568=>     `Enough, enough!' cried Gimli.  'We are departing as quickly as we may!' 
line 19569=>And  indeed with that  last stroke the malice  of  the mountain seemed to be 
line 19570=>expended, as if Caradhras was  satisfied  that the invaders had been  beaten 
line 19571=>off  and  would not  dare to  return. The threat of snow lift ed; the  clouds 
line 19572=>began to break and the light grew broader. 
line 19573=>     As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow  became steadily more 
line 19574=>shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon 
line 19575=>they  all stood once more on the  flat shelf at the head of the steep  slope 
line 19576=>where they had felt the first flakes of snow the night before. 
line 19577=>     The morning was now far advanced. From  the high place they looked back  
line 19578=>
line 19579=>####-westwards over the lower lands.  Far away in the tumble of country  that lay 
line 19580=>at the foot of the  mountain  was  the  dell  from which they had started to 
line 19581=>climb the pass.  
line 19582=>     Frodo's legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head 
line 19583=>was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill. Black specks 
line 19584=>swam  before his eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the 
line 19585=>distance below him, but still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were 
line 19586=>circling in the air. 
line 19587=>     `The birds again!' said Aragorn, pointing down. 
line 19588=>     'That cannot be helped  now,' said Gandalf.  `Whether they are good  or  
line 19589=>evil,  or have nothing to do with us at  all, we must go  down at  once. Not 
line 19590=>even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!' 
line 19591=>     A cold  wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the 
line 19592=>Redhorn Gate,  and stumbled  wearily down the  slope. Caradhras had defeated 
line 19593=>them. 
line 19594=>
line 19595=>####- 
line 19596=> 
line 19597=>
line 19598=>Chapter 4. A Journey in the Dark 
line 19599=>
line 19600=> 
line 19601=> 
line 19602=>     It was  evening, and the  grey light  was again  waning fast, when they 
line 19603=>halted  for the night. They were very  weary.  The mountains were veiled  in 
line 19604=>deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more 
line 19605=>mouthful 
line 19606=>each of the miruvor  of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a  
line 19607=>council.  
line 19608=>     'We cannot, of  course, go on again  tonight,' he said. `The attack   on 
line 19609=>the Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.' 
line 19610=>     `And then where are we to go? ' asked Frodo. 
line 19611=>     'We still have our journey and our errand before us,' answered Gandalf.  
line 19612=>`We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.' 
line 19613=>     Pippin's  face brightened visibly at the  mere  mention  of  return  to 
line 19614=>Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked  up hopefully. But Aragorn  and Boromir 
line 19615=>made 
line 19616=>no sign. Frodo looked troubled.  
line 19617=>     `I wish I was back there,' he said. `But how can I return without shame 
line 19618=>-- unless there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? ' 
line 19619=>     `You  are right, Frodo,'  said Gandalf:  `to go back is to admit defeat 
line 19620=>and face worse defeat to come. If we go  back now, then the Ring must remain 
line 19621=>there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell 
line 19622=>will be  besieged,  and after a  brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. 
line 19623=>The  Ringwraiths  are deadly  enemies, but they are only shadows  yet of the 
line 19624=>power and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master's 
line 19625=>hand again.' 
line 19626=>     'Then  we must  go on, if there is a way,' said  Frodo with a sigh. Sam 
line 19627=>sank back into gloom. 
line 19628=>     `There is a way that we may attempt,' said Gandalf. `I thought from the 
line 19629=>beginning, when  first I considered this journey, that we should try it. But 
line 19630=>it is not a pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the Company before. 
line 19631=>Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had  at least been 
line 19632=>tried.' 
line 19633=>     `If  it  is a worse road  than the  Redhorn Gate,  then it must be evil 
line 19634=>
line 19635=>####-indeed,' said Merry. `But you had better tell us about it, and  let  us know 
line 19636=>the worst at once.' 
line 19637=>     'The road  that I speak  of leads to the Mines of Moria,' said Gandalf.  
line 19638=>Only  Gimli lifted  up his head; a smouldering fire  was in his eyes. On all 
line 19639=>the others a dread fell at  the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it 
line 19640=>was a legend of vague fear: 
line 19641=>     `The road  may lead  to Moria,  but how can  we  hope that it will lead 
line 19642=>through Moria? ' said Aragorn darkly. 
line 19643=>     `It  is a name of ill omen,' said Boromir. `Nor do I see the need to go 
line 19644=>there. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we 
line 19645=>come  to the Gap of Rohan, where men  are friendly to  my people, taking the 
line 19646=>road that  I followed on my way  hither. Or we might  pass by  and cross the 
line 19647=>Isen into Langstrand and  Lebennin,  and so come to Gondor from the  regions 
line 19648=>nigh to the sea.' 
line 19649=>     'Things have changed since you came  north, Boromir,' answered Gandalf.  
line 19650=>'Did you not hear what I  told you  of Saruman? With him I may have business 
line 19651=>of my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near Isengard, if that 
line 19652=>can by any means be prevented. The Gap of Rohan is closed to  us while we go 
line 19653=>with the Bearer. 
line 19654=>     'As  for the longer road:  we cannot  afford the time. We might spend a  
line 19655=>year in such a journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty 
line 19656=>and  harbourless.  Yet  they would not  be safe. The watchful  eyes  both of 
line 19657=>Saruman and of the Enemy are on them. When you came north, Boromir, you 
line 19658=>were 
line 19659=>in the  Enemy's eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter  of 
line 19660=>small concern to  him: his  mind was busy with the pursuit of the  Ring. But 
line 19661=>you return now as  a member of the Ring's  Company, and you  are in peril as 
line 19662=>long as you remain with us. The danger will increase  with every league that 
line 19663=>we go south under the naked sky. 
line 19664=>     `Since our open attempt on the mountain-pass our plight has become more 
line 19665=>desperate, I  fear. I  see now little  hope, if  we  do not soon vanish from 
line 19666=>sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go 
line 19667=>neither over the mountains, nor round them, but  under them. That  is a road 
line 19668=>at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take.' 
line 19669=>     `We do not  know what  he expects,' said  Boromir. `He  may  watch  all 
line 19670=>roads, likely and  unlikely. In  that case to enter  Moria would  be to walk  
line 19671=>into  a  trap, hardly better than knocking at  the  gates of  the Dark Tower  
line 19672=>
line 19673=>####-itself. The name of Moria is black.' 
line 19674=>     `You speak  of  what  you do not  know,  when you  liken  Moria to  the 
line 19675=>stronghold of Sauron,' answered Gandalf.  `I alone of you  have ever been in 
line 19676=>the dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in  his older and lesser dwelling in  
line 19677=>Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates of Barad-dyr do not return. But I wou ld 
line 19678=>not lead you into Moria if there  were no hope of coming out again. If there 
line 19679=>are Orcs there,  it may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Orcs 
line 19680=>of the Misty Mountains were  scattered or  destroyed  in the Battle  of Five 
line 19681=>Armies. The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar; but there 
line 19682=>is a hope that Moria is still free. 
line 19683=>     `There is  even a chance that Dwarves are  there, and that in some deep 
line 19684=>hall of his fathers, Balin son of Fundin may be found. However it may prove, 
line 19685=>one must tread the path that need chooses!' 
line 19686=>     'I will tread the  path with you, Gandalf! ' said Gimli. 'I will go and 
line 19687=>look on  the halls of Durin, whatever may  wait  there-if  you can  find the 
line 19688=>doors that are shut.' 
line 19689=>     'Good,  Gimli!  '  said  Gandalf.  `You encourage me. We  will seek the 
line 19690=>hidden  doors together.  And  we will come  through.  In  the  ruins of  the 
line 19691=>Dwarves, a dwarf's head  will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men  or  
line 19692=>Hobbits. Yet it  will not  be the first time  that  I have been to  Moria. I 
line 19693=>sought  there long for Thrbin son of  Thrur  after  he  was  lost.  I passed 
line 19694=>through, and I came out again alive! ' 
line 19695=>     `I too once passed the Dimrill Gate,' said Aragorn quietly; 'but though 
line 19696=>I also came out again, the memory is very evil. I do not wish to enter Moria  
line 19697=>a second time.' 
line 19698=>     'And I don't wish to enter it even once,' said Pippin. 
line 19699=>     'Nor me,' muttered Sam. 
line 19700=>     `Of course not!  ' said Gandalf.  'Who would? But  the question is: who 
line 19701=>will follow me, if I lead you there? ' 
line 19702=>     'I will,' said Gimli eagerly. 
line 19703=>     'I  will,' said  Aragorn  heavily.  `You  followed  my  lead almost  to 
line 19704=>disaster in  the  snow, and have said no  word of  blame. I will follow your 
line 19705=>lead  now  -- if this last warning does not move you. It is  not of the Ring, 
line 19706=>nor of  us others that  I am thinking now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to 
line 19707=>you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware! ' 
line 19708=>     `I  will not go,' said Boromir;  'not  unless  the vote  of  the  whole 
line 19709=>company  is  against me.  What  do  Legolas and  the  little  folk  say? The 
line 19710=>
line 19711=>####-Ring-bearer's voice surely should be heard? ' 
line 19712=>     'I do not wish to go to Moria,' said Legolas.  
line 19713=>     The  hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. `I  
line 19714=>do  not wish to go,' he said; `but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of 
line 19715=>Gandalf. I  beg that there should be  no vote,  until we  have slept on  it. 
line 19716=>Gandalf will get votes easier in the light of the morning than in this  cold 
line 19717=>gloom. How the wind howls! ' 
line 19718=>     At  these  words  all fell  into silent thought. They  heard  the  wind 
line 19719=>hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round 
line 19720=>them in the empty spaces of the night. 
line 19721=>     Suddenly  Aragorn leapt to  his feet. 'How the wind howls! '  he cried. 
line 19722=>'It is howling with wolf-voices. The  Wargs have  come west of the Mountains!  
line 19723=>' 
line 19724=>     'Need we wait until morning then? ' said Gandalf. `It is as I said. The 
line 19725=>hunt  is  up! Even if  we live to see the dawn, who now will wish to journey  
line 19726=>south by night with the wild wolves on his trail? ' 
line 19727=>     'How far is Moria? ' asked Boromir. 
line 19728=>     `There was a door south-west  of Caradhras,  some  fifteen miles as the 
line 19729=>crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,' answered Gandalf grimly. 
line 19730=>     'Then let  us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if  we can,'  said 
line 19731=>Boromir. 'The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears.' 
line 19732=>     `True!' said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. `But where the 
line 19733=>warg howls, there also the orc prowls.' 
line 19734=>     `I  wish I had taken Elrond's advice,' muttered Pippin to Sam. `I am no 
line 19735=>good after all. There is not enough of the breed of Bandobras the Bullroarer  
line 19736=>in  me:  these  howls  freeze my  blood.  I  don't ever  remember feeling so 
line 19737=>wretched.' 
line 19738=>     'My heart's  right  down  in my  toes, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam.  'But  we 
line 19739=>aren't etten yet,  and there are some stout folk here with  us. Whatever may 
line 19740=>be in store for old Gandalf, I'll wager it isn't a wolf's belly.' 
line 19741=>     For their defence in the  night the Company  climbed to the  top of the 
line 19742=>small hill under which they had been sheltering. it was crowned  with a knot  
line 19743=>of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones. 
line 19744=>In the midst of  this they lit a fire,  for there was  no hope that darkness 
line 19745=>and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs.  
line 19746=>     Round the  fire  they  sat,  and those  that  were  not on  guard dozed 
line 19747=>uneasily.  Poor  Bill the  pony  trembled  and sweated where he  stood.  The  
line 19748=>
line 19749=>####-howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and 
line 19750=>sometimes 
line 19751=>further off.  In the dead  of the night many shining eyes were  seen peering 
line 19752=>over the brow of the  hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a  
line 19753=>gap  in the circle a great  dark wolf-shape  could be seen halted, gazing at 
line 19754=>them.  A shuddering howl  broke from him, as if he  were a captain summoning 
line 19755=>his pack to the assault. 
line 19756=>     Gandalf stood  up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. 'Listen, 
line 19757=>Hound of Sauron! ' he cried. `Gandalf is here.  Fly, if you value  your foul 
line 19758=>skin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.' 
line 19759=>     The wolf snarled and  sprang towards  them  with a great leap.  At that 
line 19760=>moment  there was a sharp twang. Legolas  had  loosed his bow.  There  was a  
line 19761=>hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to  the ground; the elvish arrow 
line 19762=>had  pierced  its  throat. The  watching  eyes were  suddenly  extinguished. 
line 19763=>Gandalf  and  Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting 
line 19764=>packs had fled. All about them  the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on 
line 19765=>the sighing wind. 
line 19766=>     The  night was  old, and westward the waning moon was setting. gleaming 
line 19767=>fitfully  through the breaking clouds.  Suddenly  Frodo started  from sleep. 
line 19768=>Without warning  a  storm of  howls broke out fierce and wild all  about the 
line 19769=>camp. A great host of Wargs ha d gathered silently and was now attacking them 
line 19770=>from every side at once. 
line 19771=>     `Fling  fuel on the  fire!' cried  Gandalf to  the  hobbits. `Draw your 
line 19772=>blades, and stand back to back!' 
line 19773=>     In the leaping light, as  the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many gr ey 
line 19774=>shapes spring over  the  ring of stones. More and more followed. Through the 
line 19775=>throat of one  huge  leader  Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with  a  
line 19776=>great sweep Boromir hewed the head off another. Beside them Gimli stood 
line 19777=>with 
line 19778=>his  stout  legs apart,  wielding  his  dwarf-axe.  The  bow of  Legolas was 
line 19779=>singing. 
line 19780=>     In the wavering firelight  Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, 
line 19781=>a  great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of  stone set 
line 19782=>upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to 
line 19783=>meet the wolves. They gave  back before him. High in  the air he  tossed the 
line 19784=>blazing  brand.  It flared with a  sudden white radiance like lightning; and 
line 19785=>his voice rolled like thunder. 
line 19786=>
line 19787=>####-     `Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!' he cried. 
line 19788=>     There was a roar and a crackle, and  the  tree above him  burst  into a  
line 19789=>leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt  from tree-top to tree-top. 
line 19790=>The whole hill was crowned with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the 
line 19791=>defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in  the air 
line 19792=>as it flew, and  plunged burning into the  heart of a  great wolf-chieftain. 
line 19793=>All the others fled. 
line 19794=>     Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash  and sparks;  
line 19795=>a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the 
line 19796=>hill, as the first  light of dawn came dimly in the  sky. Their enemies were 
line 19797=>routed and did not return. 
line 19798=>     `What did I  tell  you,  Mr. Pippin?  ' said Sam, she/thing his  sword. 
line 19799=>`Wolves won't get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed 
line 19800=>the hair off my head!' 
line 19801=>     When  the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to 
line 19802=>be found, and they  looked in vain for the  bodies of the  dead. No trace of 
line 19803=>the fight remained but the  charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on 
line 19804=>the hill-top. All were undamaged save one of which only the point was left. 
line 19805=>     `It is as  I feared,'  said Gandalf.  `These  were no  ordinary  wolves 
line 19806=>hunting for food in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!' 
line 19807=>     That day  the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command  
line 19808=>of some power that had no longer  any use for snow, since they had retreated 
line 19809=>from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in  which things 
line 19810=>that  moved  in the  wild could be  seen from far away.  The  wind  had been 
line 19811=>turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The 
line 19812=>clouds  vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue.  As  they 
line 19813=>stood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight gleamed over  the 
line 19814=>mountain-tops.  
line 19815=>     `We must reach  the doors before sunset,' said Gandalf,  'or I  fear we 
line 19816=>shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for  
line 19817=>here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only 
line 19818=>once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago. 
line 19819=>     `There  it lies,' he said,  pointing away south-eastwards to where  the 
line 19820=>mountains' sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet.  In the distance 
line 19821=>could  be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs,  and in their midst, taller than 
line 19822=>the rest, one great grey wall. `When we left the pass I  led you southwards,  
line 19823=>and not  back to  our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It is 
line 19824=>
line 19825=>####-well that I  did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and  haste 
line 19826=>is needed. Let us go! ' 
line 19827=>     `I do not know which to hope,' said  Boromir grimly: `that Gandalf will 
line 19828=>find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost 
line 19829=>for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall  
line 19830=>the likeliest chance. Lead on!' 
line 19831=>     Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard's side, so eager was he to come to 
line 19832=>Moria. Together they led  the Company back towards the  mountains. The  only 
line 19833=>road of old  to Moria from the  west  had lain along the course of a stream, 
line 19834=>the Sirannon,  that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors 
line 19835=>had stood.  But either Gandalf was astray,  or  else the land had changed in 
line 19836=>recent years; for he  did not strike the stream where he  looked to  find it, 
line 19837=>only a few miles southwards from their start. 
line 19838=>     The morning was  passing towards noon,  and still the  Company wandered 
line 19839=>and scrambled in a barren country  of red stones. Nowhere could they see any 
line 19840=>gleam of  water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts 
line 19841=>sank.  They saw no living thing, and not a bird was in the sky; but what the 
line 19842=>night  would bring, if it caught them in that  lost land, none of them cared 
line 19843=>to think. 
line 19844=>     Suddenly Gimli, who  had pressed on ahead, called back  to them. He was 
line 19845=>standing  on a knoll and pointing to the  right. Hurrying up they saw  below 
line 19846=>them  a  deep and narrow channel. It was  empty and  silent,  and  hardly  a  
line 19847=>trickle of water flowed among the  brown and red-stained  stones of its bed;  
line 19848=>but  on the  near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound 
line 19849=>its way among the ruined walls and paving -stones of an ancient highroad. 
line 19850=>     'Ah! Here it is at last! ' said Gandalf. `This is where the stream ran: 
line 19851=>Sirannon, the  Gate-stream, they used  to call  it. But what has happened to 
line 19852=>the water,  I cannot guess; it used  to  be swift  and noisy.  Come! We must  
line 19853=>hurry on. We are late.' 
line 19854=>     The Company were  footsore and tired; but they  trudged  doggedly along 
line 19855=>the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the noon and 
line 19856=>began  to go west. After  a brief halt  and a hasty meal they went on again. 
line 19857=>Before them the  mountains frowned, but  their path lay in a deep  trough of 
line 19858=>land  and  they  could  see only  the higher shoulders and the  far eastward 
line 19859=>peaks. 
line 19860=>     At length they came  to a sharp  bend. There  the road, which had  been 
line 19861=>veering southwards between the brink of the channel and  a steep fall of the 
line 19862=>
line 19863=>####-land to the left, turned and went due east again. Rounding  the corner  they 
line 19864=>saw  before them a  low  cliff, some  five fathoms  high, with a  broken and 
line 19865=>jagged  top. Over  it  a trickling water  dripped, through a wide cleft that 
line 19866=>seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been  strong and full.  
line 19867=>     `Indeed things have changed! ' said Gandalf. `But there is no mistaking 
line 19868=>the  place.  There  is  all  that remains of the  Stair Falls. If I remember  
line 19869=>right, there was  a flight of steps cut  in the  rock at their side, but the 
line 19870=>main road  wound away left and climbed with several  loops  up  to the level 
line 19871=>ground at  the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right 
line 19872=>up to the Walls of  Moria, and the Sirannon flowed  through it with the road 
line 19873=>beside it. Let us go and see what things are like now! ' 
line 19874=>     They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly 
line 19875=>up them,  followed by Gandalf and Frodo.  When they reached the top they saw 
line 19876=>that  they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of 
line 19877=>the Gate-stream was revealed. Behind  them the sinking Sun filled  the  cool  
line 19878=>western sky with glimmering  gold. Before them stretched a dark still  lake. 
line 19879=>Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on its sullen surface. The Sirannon had 
line 19880=>been dammed  and had filled  all the valley.  Beyond the  ominous water were 
line 19881=>reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in  the fading light: final and 
line 19882=>impassable. No sign of gate or entrance,  not a fissure or crack could Frodo 
line 19883=>see in the frowning stone. 
line 19884=>     `There  are  the  Walls  of  Moria,' said Gandalf,  pointing across the 
line 19885=>water. `And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven Door at the end 
line 19886=>of the road from Hollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None 
line 19887=>of  the Company, I guess, will wish to swim this  gloomy water at the end  of 
line 19888=>the day. It has an unwholesome look.' 
line 19889=>     `We  must find a way round the northern  edge,' said Gimli. `The  first  
line 19890=>thing for the  Company to  do is to climb up  by the main path and see where 
line 19891=>that  will lead us.  Even  if  there were  no  lake,  we could not  get  our 
line 19892=>baggage-pony up this stair.' 
line 19893=>     `But in any  case we cannot take the poor  beast  into the Mines,' said 
line 19894=>Gandalf. `The road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are  places 
line 19895=>narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.' 
line 19896=>     `Poor old Bill! ' said Frodo. `I had not thought of that. And poor Sam!  
line 19897=>I wonder what he will say?  ' 
line 19898=>     `I am sorry,' said Gandalf. `Poor Bill has  been a useful companion and 
line 19899=>it goes  to  my heart to turn him adrift now. I would have travelled lighter  
line 19900=>
line 19901=>####-and brought no animal, least of  all  this one that Sam is fond of, if I had 
line 19902=>had my way. I feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road.' 
line 19903=>     The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky 
line 19904=>high above the sunset, when the  Company,  with all  the speed  they  could,  
line 19905=>climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked 
line 19906=>to be no  more  than two or three furlongs at the widest point.  How far  it 
line 19907=>stretched  away  southward they could  not see in the failing light; but its 
line 19908=>northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between 
line 19909=>the  stony ridges  that enclosed the valley and the water's edge there was a  
line 19910=>rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still  a mile  or two 
line 19911=>to go  before they could reach the point on the  far shore that  Gandalf was 
line 19912=>making for; and then he had still to find the doors. 
line 19913=>     When  they came to the northernmost corner of  the  lake  they  found a  
line 19914=>narrow creek that  barred their way. It was green and stagnant,  thrust  out 
line 19915=>like  a  slimy  arm  towards  the  enclosing  hills.  Gimli  strode  forward 
line 19916=>undeterred, and found that the water was shallow, no more than ankle-deep at 
line 19917=>the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for  
line 19918=>under  the  weedy  pools were sliding  and  greasy  stones, and footing  was 
line 19919=>treacherous. Frodo shuddered  with disgust at  the touch of the dark unclean 
line 19920=>water on his feet. 
line 19921=>     As  Sam,  the last of the Company, led Bill up  on to the dry ground on 
line 19922=>the  far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a  
line 19923=>fish had disturbed the still surface of  the water. Turning quickly they saw 
line 19924=>ripples, black -edged  with shadow in  the  waning  light: great  rings  were 
line 19925=>widening outwards from  a point far out in the lake.  There  was  a bubbling  
line 19926=>noise, and then silence.  The  dusk  deepened, and  the  last gleams of  the 
line 19927=>sunset were veiled in cloud. 
line 19928=>     Gandalf  now  pressed on  at  a great pace, and the  others followed as 
line 19929=>quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry  land between  the lake 
line 19930=>and the cliffs: it  was  narrow,  often  hardly  a  dozen yards  across, and 
line 19931=>encumbered  with fallen  rock  and stones; but they found a way, hugging the 
line 19932=>cliff,  and  keeping  as  far  from the  dark water as  they might.  A  mile 
line 19933=>southwards  along  the shore  they  came upon holly trees.  Stumps  and dead 
line 19934=>boughs were rotting  in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets,  
line 19935=>or of a hedge that had once lined the  road  across the drowned valley.  But 
line 19936=>close under the cliff  there  stood,  still strong and  living,  . two  tall 
line 19937=>trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo  had ever seen or imagined. 
line 19938=>
line 19939=>####-Their  great  roots spread  from the  wall to the  water. Under the   looming 
line 19940=>cliffs  they had looked like mere bushes, when seen  far off from the top of 
line 19941=>the Stair; but now they  towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing 
line 19942=>deep night-shadows about their feet,  standing  like sentinel pillars at the 
line 19943=>end of the road. 
line 19944=>     `Well, here  we are at last!  ' said  Gandalf. 'Here the Elven-way from 
line 19945=>Hollin ended. Holly  was  the  token  of the  people of that land, and  they 
line 19946=>planted it here to mark the end of their  domain; for the West -door was made 
line 19947=>chiefly for their  use in their traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those  were 
line 19948=>happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of 
line 19949=>different race, even between Dwarves and Elves.' 
line 19950=>     'It was not  the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship  waned,' said 
line 19951=>Gimli. 
line 19952=>     'I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,' said Legolas. 
line 19953=>     'I have heard both,' said Gandalf; 'and I will not give judgement  now. 
line 19954=>But I beg you two, Legolas  and Gimli, at least  to  be friends, and to help 
line 19955=>me. I need you  both.  The  doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find  
line 19956=>them the better. Night is at hand! ' 
line 19957=>     Turning to  the others he said:  'While I  am  searching, will you each 
line 19958=>make ready to enter the  Mines? For here I fear we  must say farewell to our  
line 19959=>good  bea st of burden. You must lay aside much  of the stuff that we brought 
line 19960=>against  bitter weather:  you will  not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we 
line 19961=>come through  and journey on down  into the South.  Instead each of us  must  
line 19962=>take  a  share  of  what  the pony   carried,  especially  the food  and  the 
line 19963=>water -skins.' 
line 19964=>     'But you can't  leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken  place, Mr. 
line 19965=>Gandalf! ' cried Sam,  angry and  distressed.  `I won't have  it, and that's 
line 19966=>flat. After he has come so far and all! ' 
line 19967=>     'I am sorry, Sam,'  said the wizard. `But when the  Door opens I do not 
line 19968=>think  you will  be able  to  drag your Bill  inside, into  the long dark of 
line 19969=>Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.' 
line 19970=>     'He'd  follow Mr. Frodo into  a dragon's  den, if I led him,' protested 
line 19971=>Sam.  `It'd  be nothing short  of murder  to turn  him loose with  all these 
line 19972=>wolves about.' 
line 19973=>     'It will be short of murder, I hope,' said Gandalf. He laid his hand on 
line 19974=>the pony's head, and spoke  in  a  low voice. `Go with  words  of  guard and 
line 19975=>guiding on you,' he said. `You are a wise  beast, and  have  learned much in 
line 19976=>
line 19977=>####-Rivendell. Make your ways to places where you can find grass, and so come in 
line 19978=>time to Elrond's house, or wherever you wish to go. 
line 19979=>     `There, Sam! He will have quite as  much chance of escaping wolves  and 
line 19980=>getting home as we have.' 
line 19981=>     Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to  
line 19982=>understand well what  was going on, nuzzled up to  him,  putting his nose to 
line 19983=>Sam's  ear. Sam burst into tears, and  fumbled with the straps, unlading all 
line 19984=>the pony's packs and throwing them on the ground. The others  sorted out the 
line 19985=>goods, making a  pile of all that could be left behind,  and dividing up the 
line 19986=>rest. 
line 19987=>     When this was  done  they turned to watch Gandalf. He  appeared to have 
line 19988=>done nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall 
line 19989=>of the cliff, as if he  would bore a hole  into it  with his eyes. Gimli was 
line 19990=>wandering about, tapping the stone here  and there with his axe. Legolas was 
line 19991=>pressed against the rock, as if listening. 
line 19992=>     'Well, here  we are and all ready,'  said  Merry;  `but  where  are the 
line 19993=>Doors? I can't see any sign of them.' 
line 19994=>     'Dwarf-doors are  not made to be seen when shut,' said Gimli. `They are 
line 19995=>invisible, and their own  masters cannot  find them or  open them,  if their 
line 19996=>secret is forgotten.' 
line 19997=>     'But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,' said 
line 19998=>Gandalf, coming  suddenly to  life and turning  round.  `Unless  things  are 
line 19999=>altogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.' 
line 20000=>     He walked forward  to the wall. Right  between the shadow  of the trees 
line 20001=>there  was a smooth space,  and over this he passed  his  hands to and  fro, 
line 20002=>muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back. 
line 20003=>     'Look!' he said. `Can you see anything now?' 
line 20004=>     The Moon  now shone upon the grey face of the  rock; but they could see 
line 20005=>nothing else for a  while.  Then slowly on the surface, where  the  wizard's 
line 20006=>hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running 
line 20007=>in the stone. At first they were no more than pale gossamer -threads, so fine 
line 20008=>that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon  caught  them,  but steadily 
line 20009=>they grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed. 
line 20010=> 
line 20011=>     At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was  an arch of interlacing 
line 20012=>letters in an Elvish  character. Below,  though  the threads were in  places 
line 20013=>blurred  or  broken,  the  outline could be seen of an  anvil  and  a hammer  
line 20014=>
line 20015=>####-surmounted by a crown with seven  stars. Beneath these again were two trees,  
line 20016=>each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in 
line 20017=>the middle of the door a single star with many rays.  
line 20018=>     `There are the emblems of Durin!' cried Gimli. 
line 20019=>     `And there is the Tree of the High Elves!' said Legolas.  
line 20020=>     `And the Star of the House of Flanor,' said Gandalf. `They  are wrought 
line 20021=>of  ithildin  that mirrors only starlight  and moonlight, and sleeps until it 
line 20022=>is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth. It is 
line 20023=>long since I heard them, and I thought deeply  before I could recall them to 
line 20024=>my mind.' 
line 20025=>     'What does the writing  say?' asked  Frodo, who was trying  to decipher  
line 20026=>the inscription on the arch. 'I thought I knew the elf-letters but  I cannot 
line 20027=>read these.' 
line 20028=>     `The words are in  the elven-tongue of the West of  Middle-earth in the 
line 20029=>Elder Days,' answered Gandalf.  'But they do not say anything  of importance 
line 20030=>to us.  They say only: The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and 
line 20031=>enter.  And  underneath  small and faint  is written:  I, Narvi,  made them. 
line 20032=>Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.' 
line 20033=>     `What does it mean by speak, friend, and enter?' asked Merry. 
line 20034=>     'That is plain enough,'  said  Gimli. `If  you are a friend,  speak the 
line 20035=>password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.' 
line 20036=>     'Yes,' said Gandalf, 'these doors are probably  governed by words. Some 
line 20037=>dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for  particular persons; and 
line 20038=>some have locks and keys that  are still needed when all necessary times and  
line 20039=>words are known. These doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not 
line 20040=>secret. They usually  stood  open  and doorwards sat here. But  if they were 
line 20041=>shut, any who  knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At lea st so 
line 20042=>it is recorded, is it not, Gimli? ' 
line 20043=>     'It is,' said the dwarf. `But what the  word  was  is  not  remembered. 
line 20044=>Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the earth.' 
line 20045=>     'But do not you know the word, Gandalf? ' asked Boromir in surprise. 
line 20046=>     `No! ' said the wizard. 
line 20047=>     The others looked  dismayed;  only  Aragorn,  who  knew  Gandalf  well, 
line 20048=>remained silent and unmoved. 
line 20049=>     'Then  what was  the use of bringing us to this  accursed spot?'  cried 
line 20050=>Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at  the dark water. `You  told us that 
line 20051=>you had  once passed  through the  Mines. How  could that be, if you did not 
line 20052=>
line 20053=>####-know how to enter? ' 
line 20054=>     `The answer to your first question, Boromir,' said the wizard, `is that 
line 20055=>I do not know the word-yet. But we shall  soon see.  And,' he added,  with  a  
line 20056=>glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, 'you may ask what  is the use 
line 20057=>of my deeds when they are proved useless. As for your other question: do you 
line 20058=>doubt  my  tale? Or have you no wits left? I did  not enter this way. I came 
line 20059=>from the East. 
line 20060=>     `If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors  open  outwards.  
line 20061=>From the inside you may thrust them open with  your  hands. From the outside 
line 20062=>nothing  will move  them  save  the spell of command.  They cannot be forced 
line 20063=>inwards.' 
line 20064=>     `What  are  you going  to do  then? '  asked  Pippin, undaunted  by the 
line 20065=>wizard's bristling brows.  
line 20066=>     `Knock on  the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,' said Gandalf. `But 
line 20067=>if that does not shatter them, and I  am allowed a little peace from foolish 
line 20068=>questions, I will seek for the opening words. 
line 20069=>     `I  once knew every spell in all the tongues  of Elves or  Men  or Orcs 
line 20070=>that was  ever  used for such a purpose. I can still  remember  ten score of 
line 20071=>them  without searching in  my mind. But on ly a few trials, I think, will be 
line 20072=>needed;  and I  shall not  have  to call on  Gimli for  words  of the secret 
line 20073=>dwarf-tongue  that  they  teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like 
line 20074=>the writing on the arch: that seems certain.' 
line 20075=>     He stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the 
line 20076=>silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil. 
line 20077=>     Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen! 
line 20078=>     Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen! 
line 20079=>     he said  in a commanding voice.  The silver lines faded, but the  blank  
line 20080=>grey stone did not stir. 
line 20081=>     Many times he  repeated these words in different order, or varied them. 
line 20082=>Then  he tried other spells.  one  after another,  speaking  now faster  and 
line 20083=>louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech. 
line 20084=>Nothing happened. The cliff towered into the night, the countless stars were 
line 20085=>kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast. 
line 20086=>     Again Gandalf approached the  wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in 
line 20087=>tones of command and rising wrath. Edro, edro! he cried, and struck the rock 
line 20088=>with  his  staff.  Open,  open! he shouted, and followed  it with  the  same 
line 20089=>command  in  every  language that had  ever  been  spoken  in  the  West  of 
line 20090=>
line 20091=>####-Middle-earth.  Then he  threw  his  staff  on the  ground, and  sat down  in 
line 20092=>silence. 
line 20093=>     At that moment from far off the  wind bore to their listening ears  the 
line 20094=>howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and Sam sprang to his side 
line 20095=>and whispered softly to him. 
line 20096=>     'Do not let him run away! ' said Boromir. 'It seems that we  shall need 
line 20097=>him still, if the wolves do not  find us. How  I  hate  this foul pool! ' He 
line 20098=>stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water. 
line 20099=>     The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at  the same instant there was 
line 20100=>a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface  out beyond  
line 20101=>where the stone had fallen, and they moved slowly towards  the  foot  of the 
line 20102=>cliff. 
line 20103=>     'Why did  you do  that, Boromir? ' said Frodo. `I hate this place, too, 
line 20104=>and I am afraid. I don't know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the 
line 20105=>doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool. Don't disturb it! ' 
line 20106=>     'l wish we could get away! ' said Merry. 
line 20107=>     'Why doesn't Gandalf do something quick? ' said Pippin. 
line 20108=>     Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat  with his head bowed,  either in 
line 20109=>despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was  heard 
line 20110=>again. The ripples  on the water  grew and came  closer;  some were  already  
line 20111=>lapping on the shore. 
line 20112=>     With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. 
line 20113=>He was laughing! `I have it! '  he  cried. 'Of  course, of  course! Absurdly 
line 20114=>simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.' 
line 20115=>     Picking up  his  staff he  stood before  the rock and  said  in  a clear 
line 20116=>voice: Mellon! 
line 20117=>     The  star  shone  out briefly  and faded again.  Then silently  a great 
line 20118=>doorway was  outlined, though not a  crack or joint had been visible before. 
line 20119=>Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch  by inch, until both  
line 20120=>doors lay back against the wall.  Through the opening a shadowy stair  could  
line 20121=>be seen climbing steeply up; but  beyond the  lower  steps the darkness  was 
line 20122=>deeper than the night. The Company stared in wonder. 
line 20123=>     `I was wrong after all,' said  Gandalf, 'and Gimli  too. Merry, of  all 
line 20124=>people, was on  the  right track.  The  opening word  was  inscribed on  the 
line 20125=>archway  all the time!  The translation  should have been:  Say "Friend" and 
line 20126=>enter. I had only to speak the Elvish word for friend and the  doors opened. 
line 20127=>Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days.  
line 20128=>
line 20129=>####-Those were happier times. Now let us go!' 
line 20130=>     He strode  forward  and  set his foot  on the lowest  step. But at that 
line 20131=>moment several things happened. Frodo felt something seize  him by the ankle, 
line 20132=>and he fell with a cry. Bill  the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned 
line 20133=>tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped  after  
line 20134=>him, and  then hearing Frodo's cry  he ran back again, weeping  and cursing.  
line 20135=>The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host  
line 20136=>of snakes were swimming up from the southern end. 
line 20137=>     Out  from  the  water  a  long sinuous  tentacle had  crawled;  it  was 
line 20138=>pale-green  and luminous and wet.  Its fingered end had ho ld of Frodo's foot  
line 20139=>and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it 
line 20140=>with a knife. 
line 20141=>     The arm  let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. 
line 20142=>Twenty others arms came rippling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a  
line 20143=>hideous stench. 
line 20144=>     `Into  the gateway!  Up  the stairs!  Quick! ' shouted Gandalf  leaping 
line 20145=>back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but Sam to 
line 20146=>the ground where they stood, he drove them forward. 
line 20147=>     They were  just in time. Sam and  Frodo were  only  a few steps up, and 
line 20148=>Gandalf had just  begun to climb, when the groping tentacles writhed  across 
line 20149=>the  narrow  shore  and  fingered  the cliff-wall  and  the  doors. One came 
line 20150=>wriggling over  the  threshold, glistening in  the starlight. Gandalf turned 
line 20151=>and paused. If he  was considering what word would close the gate again from 
line 20152=>within, there  was no  need. Many  coiling  arms seized the  doors on either  
line 20153=>side, and with horrible strength, swung them round.  With a shattering  echo 
line 20154=>they slammed,  and all  light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came 
line 20155=>dully through the ponderous stone. 
line 20156=>     Sam,  clinging  to  Frodo's arm, collapsed  on  a  step  in  the  black  
line 20157=>darkness.  `Poor old  Bill!  ' he said in a choking  voice. `Poor   old Bill! 
line 20158=>Wolves  and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him.  I  had to choose, 
line 20159=>Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.' 
line 20160=>     They heard Gandalf go back down  the steps and thrust his staff against 
line 20161=>the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled, .but the 
line 20162=>doors did  not open. `Well, well! ' said the wizard. `The passage is blocked 
line 20163=>behind  us now  and there is only one  way  out--on  the other  side  of the 
line 20164=>mountains. I fear from the sounds that  boulders have been piled up, and the 
line 20165=>trees  uprooted and thrown across the gate. I  am sorry; for the trees  were 
line 20166=>
line 20167=>####-beautiful, and had stood so long.' 
line 20168=>     `I felt that  something horrible was near from  the moment that my foot 
line 20169=>first  touched the water,'  said Frodo. 'What  was the  thing, or were there 
line 20170=>many of them? ' 
line 20171=>     'I do not know,' answered Gandalf, 'but the arms were all guided by one 
line 20172=>purpose.  Something has  crept, or has  been driven out of dark waters under  
line 20173=>the mountains.  There  are  older and  fouler things  than  Orcs in the deep 
line 20174=>places of  the world.'  He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever  it 
line 20175=>was  that dwelt  in the lake, it had  seized  on Frodo  first among  all the 
line 20176=>Company. 
line 20177=>     Boromir muttered under  his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the 
line 20178=>sound to a  hoarse  whisper  that all could hear: `In the deep places of the 
line 20179=>world!  And thither we are going against my wish.  Who will lead  us  now in 
line 20180=>this deadly dark? ' 
line 20181=>     'I will,' said Gandalf, 'and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff!  
line 20182=>' 
line 20183=>     As  the wizard passed  on ahead up  the great steps, he held  his staff 
line 20184=>aloft, and from its tip there came  a faint radiance. The wide  stairway was 
line 20185=>sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow;  
line 20186=>and 
line 20187=>at the top they found  an arched  passage with  a level floor leading on into 
line 20188=>the dark. 
line 20189=>     `Let us  sit and rest and  have  something to eat, here on the landing, 
line 20190=>since  we can't find a dining-room! ' said  Frodo. He had begun to shake off 
line 20191=>the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry. 
line 20192=>     The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps,  
line 20193=>dim figures  in the gloom. After they had eaten,  Gandalf gave  them each  a  
line 20194=>third sip of the miruvor of Rivendell. 
line 20195=>     `It will not last much longer, I am  afraid,' he said; 'but I  think we 
line 20196=>need it after that horror at  the gate. And unless we have  great  luck,  we 
line 20197=>shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go  carefully with 
line 20198=>the water, too!  There are  many streams  and wells in  the Mines,  but they 
line 20199=>should not be touched. We  may  not  have a chance of filling  our skins and 
line 20200=>bottles till we come down into Dimrill Dale.' 
line 20201=>     'How long is that going to take us? ' asked Frodo. 
line 20202=>     'I  cannot  say,'  answered Gandalf.  'It depends  on many chances. But 
line 20203=>going straight,  without mishap  or  losing our  way, we shall take three or  
line 20204=>
line 20205=>####-four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West -door to 
line 20206=>East -gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.' 
line 20207=>     After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager  
line 20208=>to  get the journey over as quickly  as possible, and were willing, tired as 
line 20209=>they  were, to go on  marching  still for  several hours. Gandalf  walked in 
line 20210=>front as before. In his left hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light 
line 20211=>of which just showed the ground before  his feet; in his right he  held  his 
line 20212=>sword Glamdring.  Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in  the dim light 
line 20213=>as he turned his head from side to side. Behind the dwarf  walked Frodo, and 
line 20214=>he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of  Sting 
line 20215=>or of  Glamdring;  and  that was some comfort, for being the work of  Elvish 
line 20216=>smiths in  the Elder  Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any Orcs 
line 20217=>were near  at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after  him  Legolas,  and the 
line 20218=>young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the rear, grim and silent, walked 
line 20219=>Aragorn. 
line 20220=>     The passage  twisted  round a few  turns, and then began to descend. It 
line 20221=>went steadily down for  a long while before it became level once again.  The  
line 20222=>air grew  hot and  stifling, but  it was  not  foul, and at times they  felt 
line 20223=>currents of cooler air upon  their faces, issuing from half-guessed openings 
line 20224=>in the walls.  There  were  many of  these. In the  pale ray of the wizard's 
line 20225=>staff, Frodo caught glimpses of stairs and arches and of  other passages and 
line 20226=>tunnels, sloping  up,  or  running steeply down, or opening  blankly dark on 
line 20227=>either side. It was bewildering beyond hope of remembering. 
line 20228=>     Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by h is stout  courage. At least  
line 20229=>he  was not,  as  were most of the  others, troubled by the mere darkness in 
line 20230=>itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was 
line 20231=>doubtful; but it was  always  Gandalf who had the final word. The  Mines  of 
line 20232=>Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination  of Gimli, Gluin's son,  
line 20233=>dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far -off memories of 
line 20234=>a  journey long  before were now of little help, but  even  in the gloom and 
line 20235=>despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did 
line 20236=>not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his goal. 
line 20237=>     `Do not be afraid! ' said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, 
line 20238=>and Gandalf and Gimli were  whispering  together; the  others  were  crowded 
line 20239=>behind, waiting anxiously. `Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a  
line 20240=>journey,  if  never on  one so dark; and  there  are tales  of  Rivendell of 
line 20241=>greater  deeds  of his than any that I have seen. He  will  not go astray-if 
line 20242=>
line 20243=>####-there is any path to find. He has  led us in here  against our fears, but he 
line 20244=>will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself. He is  surer of finding 
line 20245=>the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Ber®thiel.' 
line 20246=>     It was well for  the Company that  they  had such  a guide. They had no 
line 20247=>fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors 
line 20248=>many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have 
line 20249=>come  to grief. There  were not only  many roads  to choose from, there were 
line 20250=>also  in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside  the  path in 
line 20251=>which their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls 
line 20252=>and floor, and  every  now  and  then  a crack would open right before their 
line 20253=>feet.  The widest was more than seven  feet across, and it  was long  before 
line 20254=>Pippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap.  The noise 
line 20255=>of churning water came  up from  far below, as if  some great mill-wheel was 
line 20256=>turning in the depths.  
line 20257=>     `Rope! ' muttered Sam. `I knew I'd want it, if I hadn't got it! ' 
line 20258=>     As  these  dangers  became  more frequent  their  march became  slower.  
line 20259=>Already  they  seemed  to  have  been  tramping  on, on,  endlessly  to  the 
line 20260=>mountains' roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort 
line 20261=>in  the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo's  spirits had risen  for a while 
line 20262=>after his escape, and  after food and a draught  of the  cordial; but  now a  
line 20263=>deep uneasiness, growing to  dread, crept over him again. Though he had been 
line 20264=>healed  in  Rivendell  of the  knife-stroke,  that grim  wound had  not been 
line 20265=>without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware  of things that could 
line 20266=>not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed  was that he  could 
line 20267=>see more in the  dark  than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And 
line 20268=>he was  in any case  the bearer of the Ring: it hung upon its chain  against 
line 20269=>his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of 
line 20270=>evil ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on 
line 20271=>the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly. 
line 20272=>     The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers.  
line 20273=>There  was  no  sound  but  the  sound of  their own feet; the dull stump of 
line 20274=>Gimli's dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the  light step of Legolas; 
line 20275=>the soft, scarce-heard patter of hobbit-feet; and in the rear  the slow firm 
line 20276=>footfalls of  Aragorn with his  long stride.  When they halted  for a moment 
line 20277=>they  heard nothing  at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and 
line 20278=>drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to imagine  that he heard, 
line 20279=>something else:  like the faint  fall of soft bare feet. It  was  never loud 
line 20280=>
line 20281=>####-enough, or near  enough, for him to  feel certain that he heard it; but once 
line 20282=>it had started it never stopped, while  the Company was moving. But  it  was 
line 20283=>not an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself,  
line 20284=>and then grew still. 
line 20285=>     It was after nightfall when they had  entered the  Mines. They had been 
line 20286=>going for several hours with only  brief  halts,  when Gandalf came  to  his 
line 20287=>first serious check.  Before  him stood a wide dark arch  opening into three 
line 20288=>passages: all  led  in  the  same  general  direction,  eastwards;  but  the 
line 20289=>left -hand  passage plunged  down, while the right-hand climbed up,  and  the  
line 20290=>middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow. 
line 20291=>     'I  have no  memory of this  place  at all! '  said  Gandalf,  standing 
line 20292=>uncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some 
line 20293=>marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was 
line 20294=>to be seen. `I am too  weary to decide,'  he said, shaking his head. `And  I 
line 20295=>expect  that you are all as weary  as I  am, or wearier.  We had better halt 
line 20296=>here for what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever  
line 20297=>dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and  the middle-night has 
line 20298=>passed.' 
line 20299=>     `Poor old Bill! ' said Sam. 'I wonder where he is. I hope  those wolves 
line 20300=>haven't got him yet.' 
line 20301=>     To the  left of  the great arch  they  found a stone door:  it was half 
line 20302=>closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie 
line 20303=>a wide chamber cut in the rock. 
line 20304=>     `Steady! Steady!  ' cried  Gandalf as Merry and  Pippin pushed forward, 
line 20305=>glad to find a place where  they could  rest  with  at least more feeling of 
line 20306=>shelter than  in  the open passage. `Steady! You do  not know what is inside  
line 20307=>yet. I will go first.' 
line 20308=>     He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. `There! '  he said, 
line 20309=>pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw 
line 20310=>a large round hole like the  mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at 
line 20311=>the edge and trailed down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near. 
line 20312=>     'One of you might have fallen in and  still be wondering  when you were 
line 20313=>going to strike the bottom,' said Aragorn to Merry. 'Let  the guide go first  
line 20314=>while you have one.' 
line 20315=>     'This seems  to  have been a guardroom, made for  the  watching  of the 
line 20316=>three passages,'  said Gimli. `That hole was plainly a  well for the guards' 
line 20317=>use, covered with a stone lid. But the  lid is broken, and we  must all take 
line 20318=>
line 20319=>####-care in the dark.' 
line 20320=>     Pippin  felt  curiously attracted by  the  well. While the  others were 
line 20321=>unrolling  blankets and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far  
line 20322=>as  possible from the hole in  the floor, he crept  to the  edge  and peered 
line 20323=>over. A chill air seemed to  strike his face,  rising from invisible depths. 
line 20324=>Moved by  a sudden impulse he groped for a loose  stone, and let it drop. He 
line 20325=>felt  his heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then  far below,  
line 20326=>as if  the stone had fallen into deep water in  some cavernous place,  there 
line 20327=>came a plunk, very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft. 
line 20328=>     `What's that? ' cried Gandalf.  He was relieved  when  Pippin confessed 
line 20329=>what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see  his  eye glinting.  
line 20330=>'Fool  of a Took!  '  he growled. 'This  is a serious journey,  not a hobbit 
line 20331=>walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and  then you will be no further  
line 20332=>nuisance. Now be quiet! ' 
line 20333=>     Nothing more was heard for several  minutes; but then there came out of 
line 20334=>the depths faint knocks: tom-tap, tap-tom. They stopped, and when the echoes 
line 20335=>had  died away, they  were repeated:  tap-tom,  tom-tap, tap-tap, tom.  They  
line 20336=>sounded  disquietingly  like signals of  some  sort;  but after a  while the 
line 20337=>knocking died away and was not heard again. 
line 20338=>     'That  was  the  sound of a  hammer, or I have never heard  one,'  said 
line 20339=>Gimli. 
line 20340=>     `Yes,' said  Gandalf, 'and I do not like it. It may  have nothing to do 
line 20341=>with Peregrin's  foolish  stone; but  probably something  has been disturbed 
line 20342=>that would have been better left quiet.  Pray, do nothing of the kind again!  
line 20343=>Let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can 
line 20344=>go on the first watch, as a  reward,' he growled, as he  rolled himself in a  
line 20345=>blanket.  
line 20346=>     Pippin  sat  miserably  by  the door in  the pitch dark; but he kept on 
line 20347=>turning  round, fearing  that some unknown thing would  crawl  up out of the 
line 20348=>well.  He  wished he could cover  the  hole,  if only with a blanket, but he 
line 20349=>dared not move or go near it, even though Gandalf seemed to be asleep. 
line 20350=>     Actually Gandalf was awake, though  lying still and silent. He was deep 
line 20351=>in  thought,  trying  to recall  every memory of  his former journey in  the 
line 20352=>Mines,  and considering  anxiously  the next  course  that he should take; a  
line 20353=>false turn now might be disastrous.  After an hour  he rose up and came over  
line 20354=>to Pippin. 
line 20355=>     `Get into a corner  and have a sleep, my lad,' he said in a kindly tone. 
line 20356=>
line 20357=>####-'You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so  I may  as well do the 
line 20358=>watching.' 
line 20359=>     'I know what is the matter with me,' he muttered, as he sat down by the 
line 20360=>door.  'I  need  smoke!  I have not tasted  it since the morning  before the 
line 20361=>snowstorm.' 
line 20362=>     The  last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took  him, was a dark glimpse 
line 20363=>of  the  old  wizard huddled on  the floor,  shielding a glowing chip in his 
line 20364=>gnarled hands  between his knees.  The flicker for  a moment showed his sharp 
line 20365=>nose. and the puff of smoke. 
line 20366=>     It was  Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He  had sat and watched 
line 20367=>all alone for  about six hours, and had let  the others  rest.  `And  in the 
line 20368=>watches I have  made up my mind,' he  said. `I  do  not  like the feel of the 
line 20369=>middle way; and  I do not like the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul 
line 20370=>air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right -hand passage. It is 
line 20371=>time we began to climb up again.' 
line 20372=>     For eight dark hours, not counting two brief  halts,  they marched  on;  
line 20373=>and they met no  danger, and heard nothing, and  saw nothing  but the  faint 
line 20374=>gleam  of  the wizard's  light, bobbing like  a will-o'-the-wisp in front of 
line 20375=>them. The passage  they  had  chosen wound steadily upwards. As  far as they 
line 20376=>could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier  
line 20377=>and wider.  There  were  now no openings  to  other galleries or  tunnels on 
line 20378=>either side, and the floor  was level  and sound,  without  pits or  cracks. 
line 20379=>Evidently  they had struck  what once had  been an important road; and  they 
line 20380=>went forward quicker than they had done on their first march. 
line 20381=>     In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in a direct line 
line 20382=>east, though  they must have actually walked twenty miles  or  more. As  the 
line 20383=>road climbed  upwards`  Frodo's spirits rose  a little;  but he  still  felt 
line 20384=>oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the 
line 20385=>Company and beyond the fall and patter of  their feet, a following  footstep 
line 20386=>that was not an echo. 
line 20387=>     They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and 
line 20388=>all were thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls 
line 20389=>to  right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some  arched 
line 20390=>doorway into a black and empty space. There  was  a great draught of  warmer  
line 20391=>air behind them, and before  them the darkness was cold on their faces. They 
line 20392=>halted and crowded anxiously together. 
line 20393=>     Gandalf seemed pleased. `I chose the right way,'  he said.  `At  last we 
line 20394=>
line 20395=>####-are  coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from 
line 20396=>the eastern side. But we are  high up, a good deal higher than  the  Dimrill 
line 20397=>Gate, unless I am mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide 
line 20398=>hall. I will now risk a little real light.' 
line 20399=>     He  raised his staff,  and for a  brief instant there was blaze  like a  
line 20400=>flash  of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a second they  
line 20401=>saw a vast roof  far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of 
line 20402=>stone. Before them and on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black  
line 20403=>walls, polished  and smooth  as  glass, flashed and glittered.  Three  other  
line 20404=>entrances  they saw, dark black  arches: one straight before them eastwards,  
line 20405=>and one on either side. Then the light went out. 
line 20406=>     `That  is all that I shall venture on for the  present,' said  Gandalf. 
line 20407=>'There used to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out 
line 20408=>to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached  them 
line 20409=>now, but it is  night outside again, and we  cannot tell until morning. If I 
line 20410=>am right, tomorrow we may  actually see  the morning peeping  in. But in the 
line 20411=>meanwhile we had better go  no further. Let  us rest, if we can. Things have 
line 20412=>gone well  so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are 
line 20413=>not through yet, and it is a long way down to the  Gates  that open  on  the 
line 20414=>world.' 
line 20415=>     The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close 
line 20416=>together  in a corner  to escape  the draught:  there seemed  to be a steady 
line 20417=>inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as  they lay 
line 20418=>hung the darkness,  hollow and  immense,  and  they  were  oppressed by  the 
line 20419=>loneliness and vastness of  the dolven halls and endlessly branching  stairs 
line 20420=>and passages. The wildest imaginings  that dark rumour had ever suggested to 
line 20421=>the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of Moria. 
line 20422=>     `There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time ' said 
line 20423=>Sam; `and every one  of them busier  than badgers for five  hundred years to 
line 20424=>make all this, and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for?  They 
line 20425=>didn't live in these darksome holes surely? ' 
line 20426=>     `These are not holes,' said Gimli. `This is the great realm and city of 
line 20427=>the Dwarrowdelf. And  of  old  it was  not  darksome, but  full of light and 
line 20428=>splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.' 
line 20429=>     He rose  and standing in the dark he  began to  chant in a  deep voice, 
line 20430=>while the echoes ran away into the roof.  
line 20431=>     The world was young, the mountains green, 
line 20432=>
line 20433=>####-     No stain yet on the Moon was seen, 
line 20434=>     No words were laid on stream or stone 
line 20435=>     When Durin woke and walked alone. 
line 20436=>     He named the nameless hills and dells; 
line 20437=>     He drank from yet untasted wells; 
line 20438=>     He stooped and looked in Mirrormere, 
line 20439=>     And saw a crown of stars appear, 
line 20440=>     As gems upon a silver thread, 
line 20441=>     Above the shadow of his head. 
line 20442=> 
line 20443=>     The world was fair, the mountains tall, 
line 20444=>     In Elder Days before the fall 
line 20445=>     Of mighty kings in Nargothrond 
line 20446=>     And Gondolin, who now beyond 
line 20447=>     The Western Seas have passed away: 
line 20448=>     The world was fair in Durin's Day. 
line 20449=> 
line 20450=>     A king he was on carven throne 
line 20451=>     In many-pillared halls of stone 
line 20452=>     With golden roof and silver floor, 
line 20453=>     And runes of power upon the door. 
line 20454=>     The light of sun and star and moon  
line 20455=>     In shining lamps of crystal hewn  
line 20456=>     Undimmed by cloud or shade of night 
line 20457=>     There shone for ever fair and bright. 
line 20458=> 
line 20459=>     There hammer on the anvil smote, 
line 20460=>     There chisel clove, and graver wrote; 
line 20461=>     There forged was blade, and bound was hilt; 
line 20462=>     The delver mined, the mason built. 
line 20463=>     There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, 
line 20464=>     And metal wrought like fishes' mail, 
line 20465=>     Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, 
line 20466=>     And shining spears were laid in hoard. 
line 20467=> 
line 20468=>     Unwearied then were Durin's folk  
line 20469=>     Beneath the mountains music woke: 
line 20470=>
line 20471=>####-     The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, 
line 20472=>     And at the gates the trumpets rang. 
line 20473=> 
line 20474=>     The world is grey, the mountains old, 
line 20475=>     The forge's fire is ashen-cold  
line 20476=>     No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: 
line 20477=>     The darkness dwells in Durin's halls 
line 20478=>     The shadow lies upon his tomb 
line 20479=>     In Moria, in Khazad-dym. 
line 20480=>     But still the sunken stars appear 
line 20481=>     In dark and windless Mirrormere; 
line 20482=>     There lies his crown in water deep, 
line 20483=>     Till Durin wakes again from sleep. 
line 20484=>     `I like  that! ' said Sam. `I  should  like  to learn it. In Moria,  in  
line 20485=>Khazad-dym!  But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking  of all  those  
line 20486=>lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here st ill?  ' 
line 20487=>     Gimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more. 
line 20488=>     `Piles  of jewels? ' said  Gandalf. `No. The Orcs have often  plundered 
line 20489=>Moria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. And since the dwarves fled, 
line 20490=>no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they 
line 20491=>are drowned in water --or in a shadow of fear.' 
line 20492=>     `Then what do the dwarves want to come back for? ' asked Sam. 
line 20493=>     'For mithril,' answered  Gandalf. `The  wealth of Moria was not in gold 
line 20494=>and jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant. Such things 
line 20495=>they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve 
line 20496=>for  them:  all things that they  desired they could obtain in  traffic. For  
line 20497=>here alone in the world was found Moria -silver, or true-silver as some  have 
line 20498=>called it: mithril is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do 
line 20499=>not tell. Its worth was  ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond price; 
line 20500=>for little is left above  ground, and even the Orcs dare not  delve here for 
line 20501=>it. The lodes lead away  north towards  Caradhras, and down to darkness. The 
line 20502=>Dwarves  tell  no tale;  but  even as  mithril  was the  foundation of their 
line 20503=>wealth, so  also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and  too 
line 20504=>deep,  and disturbed that from which they fled,  Durin's  Bane. Of what they 
line 20505=>brought to light the Orcs  have gathered nearly all, and given it in tribute 
line 20506=>to Sauron, who covets it. 
line 20507=>     `Mithril!  All  folk desired it.  It could be  beaten  like copper, and 
line 20508=>
line 20509=>####-polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light and yet 
line 20510=>harder  than tempered steel. Its beauty  was like to  that of common silver, 
line 20511=>but  the  beauty  of mithril  did not tarnish  or grow dim.  The Elves dearly 
line 20512=>loved it, and among many uses they  made of it ithildin , starmoon, which you 
line 20513=>saw  upon  the doors. Bilbo had a  corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave 
line 20514=>him. I wonder what has become of it? Gathering dust  still in Michel Delving 
line 20515=>Mathom-house, I suppose.' 
line 20516=>     `What?  ' cried  Gimli,  startled  out of  his  silence. `A  corslet of 
line 20517=>Moria -silver? That was a kingly gift! ' 
line 20518=>     'Yes,' said  Gandalf. `I never told him, but its worth was greater than 
line 20519=>the value of the whole Shire and everything in it.' 
line 20520=>     Frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the 
line 20521=>rings of his mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking 
line 20522=>about with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt 
line 20523=>no doubt that Bilbo knew quite  well.  It was indeed a kingly gift. But  now 
line 20524=>his thoughts  had been carried away  from the dark  Mines, to  Rivendell, to 
line 20525=>Bilbo,  and to Bag  End in  the days while Bilbo was  still there. He wished 
line 20526=>with  all his  heart  that he was back  there, and in those days, mowing the  
line 20527=>lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard  of Moria, 
line 20528=>or mithril --  or the Ring. 
line 20529=>     A deep silence fell.  One by one the others  fell  asleep. Frodo was on 
line 20530=>guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors  out of deep 
line 20531=>places,  dread  came  over him. His hands were cold  and his  brow  damp. He 
line 20532=>listened. All his mind was given to listening and  nothing else for two slow 
line 20533=>hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall. 
line 20534=>     His  watch  was nearly over, when, far  off  where he guessed  that the 
line 20535=>western  archway stood,  he  fancied  that he could  see two pale points  of 
line 20536=>light, almost  like  luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. `I must  
line 20537=>have  nearly fallen asleep on guard,' he thought. `I  was on  the edge  of a 
line 20538=>dream.' He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into 
line 20539=>the dark, until he was relieved by Legolas. 
line 20540=>     When he lay down  he quickly went to  sleep, but  it seemed to him that 
line 20541=>the  dream went on: he  heard whispers, and saw the two pale points of light  
line 20542=>approaching, slowly. He woke and  found that the others were speaking softly 
line 20543=>near him, and that a  dim light  was falling on his face. High  up above the 
line 20544=>eastern  archway through a shaft near  the roof came  a long pale gleam; and 
line 20545=>across the hall  through  the  northern  arch light also glimmered faint and 
line 20546=>
line 20547=>####-distantly. 
line 20548=>     Frodo sat up. `Good morning!  ' said  Gandalf: `For morning it is again 
line 20549=>at last. I was right,  you see.  We  are high up on the east  side of Moria. 
line 20550=>Before today is over we ought to find the Great  Gates and see the waters of 
line 20551=>Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill Dale before us.' 
line 20552=>     'I shall be glad,' said Gimli. `I have looked on  Moria, and it is very 
line 20553=>great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no  sign  of my 
line 20554=>kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.' 
line 20555=>     After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at  once. `We 
line 20556=>are tired, but we shall rest better  when we are outside,' he said. `I think  
line 20557=>that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria.' 
line 20558=>     `No indeed! '  said Boromir. `Which way shall we take?  Yonder eastward 
line 20559=>arch?  ' 
line 20560=>     'Maybe,' said  Gandalf. `But  I du not know yet exactly  where  we are. 
line 20561=>Unless I am quite astray, I guess that  we are above and to the north of the 
line 20562=>Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The 
line 20563=>eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before 
line 20564=>we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light 
line 20565=>in the north door. If we cou ld find a window it would help,  but I fear that 
line 20566=>the light comes only down deep shafts.' 
line 20567=>     Following  his  lead the Company  passed under the  northern arch. They 
line 20568=>found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along it the  glimmer grew 
line 20569=>stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was 
line 20570=>high and flat-topped, and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing 
line 20571=>half open.  Beyond it was a large square  chamber. It was  dimly lit, but to 
line 20572=>their eyes, after so long  a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly  bright, 
line 20573=>and they blinked as they entered. 
line 20574=>     Their  feet  disturbed  a deep dust upon the floor,  and stumbled among 
line 20575=>things  lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not at first  make out. 
line 20576=>The chamber was lit  by a  wi de shaft high in the  further  eastern wall; it 
line 20577=>slanted  upwards and, far  above,  a small square patch of blue sky could be 
line 20578=>seen. The light of the  shaft fell directly  on a table in the middle of the 
line 20579=>room:  a single  oblong block, about two  feet high,  upon  which was laid a  
line 20580=>great slab of white stone. 
line 20581=>     `It  looks  like  a tomb,' muttered  Frodo,  and  bent forwards with  a  
line 20582=>curious  sense  of foreboding,  to  look more  closely  at it.  Gandalf came 
line 20583=>quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven: 
line 20584=>
line 20585=>####- 
line 20586=>     'These  are Daeron's Runes,  such as were used  of  old in Moria,' said 
line 20587=>Gandalf. 'Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves:  
line 20588=>     balin son of fundin 
line 20589=>     lord of moria.' 
line 20590=>     'He  is  dead then,' said  Frodo. `I feared it was  so.' Gimli cast his 
line 20591=>hood over his face. 
line 20592=> 
line 20593=>
line 20594=>####- 
line 20595=>
line 20596=>Chapter 5. The Bridge of Khazad-dym 
line 20597=>
line 20598=> 
line 20599=> 
line 20600=>     The Company  of the Ring stood silent beside the  tomb of  Balin. Frodo 
line 20601=>thought  of  Bilbo  and his long friendship with the  dwarf,  and of Balin's 
line 20602=>visit to the  Shire long  ago. In  that dusty  chamber  in the mountains  it 
line 20603=>seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world. 
line 20604=>     At length they stirred and looked up, and began  to search for anything 
line 20605=>that would give them tidings of Balin's fate, or show what had become of his 
line 20606=>folk. There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under  
line 20607=>the shaft.  By both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying, 
line 20608=>and among  them  were  broken swords and axe-heads,  and cloven  shields and 
line 20609=>helms. Some of the swords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.  
line 20610=>     There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were 
line 20611=>large iron-bound chests  of  wood. All had  been  broken and plundered;  but 
line 20612=>beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. It had been 
line 20613=>slashed  and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and 
line 20614=>other  dark  marks like old blood that little of  it could be  read. Gandalf 
line 20615=>lifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it  on the 
line 20616=>slab.  He  pored over it  for  some time  without  speaking. Frodo and Gimli 
line 20617=>standing  at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they 
line 20618=>were  written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria  and of Dale,  
line 20619=>and here and  there in Elvish script. 
line 20620=>     At last Gandalf looked  up. 'It seems to be a record of the fortunes of 
line 20621=>Balin's folk,' he said. `I guess  that it began with their coming to Dimrill 
line 20622=>Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the  pages seem to have numbers referring  to 
line 20623=>the years  after their arrival. The top page is marked  one -- three, so  at 
line 20624=>least two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this!  
line 20625=>     'We drove out orcs from the great gate and  guard --  I think; the next 
line 20626=>word is blurred and burned; probably room -- we slew many in the bright -- I  
line 20627=>think -- sun in the dale. Flui was killed by  an arrow.  He slew the  great. 
line 20628=>Then there is a blur followed by Flui under grass near Mirror mere. The next 
line 20629=>line or two I cannot  read. Then comes We have taken the twentyfirst hall of 
line 20630=>North end  to  dwell in. There is I cannot read what. A shaft is  mentioned. 
line 20631=>Then Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul. ' 
line 20632=>     'The Chamber of  Records,' said Gimli. `I  guess that is  where we  now 
line 20633=>
line 20634=>####-stand.' 
line 20635=>     `Well, I can read no more for a long way,'  said  Gandalf, 'except  the 
line 20636=>word  gold , and Durin's Axe and something  helm. Then  Balin is now  lord of 
line 20637=>Moria . That seems to  end a  chapter. After some  stars another hand begins,  
line 20638=>and I can see we found  truesilver,  and  later the  word wellforged and then  
line 20639=>something, I have it! mithril; and  the last two  lines Uin to  seek for the 
line 20640=>upper  armouries of  Third  Deep,  something go westwards, a blur, to Hollin 
line 20641=>gate .' 
line 20642=>     Gandalf paused and set a few leaves  aside. 'There are several pages of 
line 20643=>the same sort, rather hastily  written and much damaged, he said; `but I can 
line 20644=>make little of  them in  this light.  Now  there must  be a number of leaves 
line 20645=>missing, because they  begin  to  be numbered  five,  the fifth year  of the 
line 20646=>colony,  I suppose. Let  me see! No, they  are too cut and stained; I cannot 
line 20647=>read them. We might do  better  in the sunlight.  Wait! Here is something: a  
line 20648=>large bold hand using an Elvish script.' 
line 20649=>     'That would be Ori's hand,' said Gimli, looking  over the wizard's arm. 
line 20650=>`He could write well and speedily, and often used the Elvish characters.' 
line 20651=>     `I  fear  he had  ill tidings to record in a  fair hand,' said Gandalf.  
line 20652=>'The first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it 
line 20653=>ends in estre. Yes, it  must  be  yestre followed by day being  the tenth of 
line 20654=>novembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone  to look in  
line 20655=>Mirror mere.  an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew the orc, hut many 
line 20656=>more  ... up  from  east up  the Silverlode. The remainder of the page is so 
line 20657=>blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think  I can read we have 
line 20658=>barred the gates, and then can  hold them long if , and then perhaps horrible  
line 20659=>and  suffer. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept  the  title that he  took for  
line 20660=>less than five years. I wonder  what happened afterwards;  but there  is  no 
line 20661=>time to  puzzle  out the last few pages. Here  is the last page of  all.' He 
line 20662=>paused and sighed. 
line 20663=>     `It  is grim reading,' he said. 'I fear their end was cruel. Listen! We 
line 20664=>cannot get  out.  We cannot get out. They have  taken the  Bridge and second 
line 20665=>hall. Frbr and Luni and  Nbli fell there. Then there are four lines  smeared 
line 20666=>so  that I can only read went 5 days  ago. The last lines run the pool is up 
line 20667=>to  the wall  at Westgate. The Wa tcher in  the Water took Uin. We cannot get 
line 20668=>out. The  end comes, and then  drums, drums in the deep. I wonder what  that 
line 20669=>means. The last thing written is in a  trailing  scrawl of elf-letters: they 
line 20670=>are coming.  There is  nothing more.'  Gandalf paused  and stood  in  silent 
line 20671=>
line 20672=>####-thought. 
line 20673=>     A sudden dread and a horror  of  the chamber fell on  the  Company. `We  
line 20674=>cannot get out,' muttered Gimli. 'It was  well for us that the pool had sunk  
line 20675=>a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end.' 
line 20676=>     Gandalf raised  his  head and  looked  round. `They seem to have made a  
line 20677=>last  stand by both doors,'  he  said; 'but there were not many left by that 
line 20678=>time. So ended the  attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The 
line 20679=>time is not come yet. Now,  I fear, we must say  farewell  to  Balin  son of 
line 20680=>Fundin.  Here  he must  lie in the halls of his  fathers.  We will take this 
line 20681=>book,  the Book  of Mazarbul, and look at  it  more  closely  later. You had 
line 20682=>better keep it, Gimli, and take it  back  to Dbin, if  you get a chance.  It 
line 20683=>will interest him, though it will grieve  him deeply. Come, let  us  go! The 
line 20684=>morning is passing.' 
line 20685=>     'Which way shall we go? ' asked Boromir. 
line 20686=>     'Back to the hall,' answered  Gandalf. 'But  our visit to this room has 
line 20687=>not been  in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the 
line 20688=>Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end. 
line 20689=>Therefore we  should leave by  the  eastern arch of the hall, and bear right 
line 20690=>and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first  Hall should be on the Seventh 
line 20691=>Level, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall! 
line 20692=>' 
line 20693=>     Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a  
line 20694=>rolling  Boom that seemed  to come  from depths far below, and to tremble in 
line 20695=>the stone at their feet. They sprang towards  the door  in alarm. Doom, doom 
line 20696=>it rolled  again, as  if huge  hands were turning the very caverns  of Moria  
line 20697=>into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great  horn  was blown 
line 20698=>in  the hall,  and answering horns  and harsh cries  were heard further off. 
line 20699=>There was a hurrying sound of many feet. 
line 20700=>     `They are coming! ' cried Legolas.  
line 20701=>     'We cannot get out,' said Gimli. 
line 20702=>     `Trapped! ' cried Gandalf. `Why  did I delay? Here we are, caught, just 
line 20703=>as they were before. But I was not here then. We will see what ----' 
line 20704=>     Doom, doom came the drum-beat and the walls shook. 
line 20705=>     'Slam the doors and wedge them! ' shouted Aragorn. 'And keep your packs 
line 20706=>on as long as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.' 
line 20707=>     `No! ' said Gandalf. 'We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar! 
line 20708=>We will go that way, if we get a chance.' 
line 20709=>
line 20710=>####-     Another  harsh  horn-call and shrill cries  rang out.  Feet were coming 
line 20711=>down the corridor.  There was a  ring and clatter  as the Company drew their 
line 20712=>swords. Glamdring shone  with a  pale light, and Sting glinted at the edges.  
line 20713=>Boromir set his shoulder against the western door. 
line 20714=>     `Wait a  moment! Do not close it yet! ' said Gandalf. He sprang forward 
line 20715=>to Boromir 's side and drew himself up to his full height. 
line 20716=>     'Who  comes hither  to disturb the rest of  Balin Lord of Moria?  '  he 
line 20717=>cried in a loud voice. 
line 20718=>     There was a  rush of  hoarse laughter, like the fall  of sliding stones 
line 20719=>into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom, 
line 20720=>boom, 
line 20721=>doom went the drums in the deep. 
line 20722=>     With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before  the narrow opening of the 
line 20723=>door and thrust forward his staff:  There was a dazzling flash that  lit the 
line 20724=>chamber  and the  passage  outside. For an instant  the wizard  looked  out. 
line 20725=>Arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back. 
line 20726=>     'There are  Orcs, very many of them,' he said. `And some are  large and 
line 20727=>evil: black Uruks of Mordor. For the moment they are hanging back, but there 
line 20728=>is something else there. A great  cave-troll,  I  think,  or more than  one. 
line 20729=>There is no hope of escape that way.' 
line 20730=>     'And no hope at all, if they  come at the other  door  as  well,'  said 
line 20731=>Boromir. 
line 20732=>     'There is no sound outside here yet,' said Aragorn, who was standing by 
line 20733=>the eastern door listening. `The passage on  this side plunges straight down 
line 20734=>a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it  is  no good 
line 20735=>flying blindly  this way with the  pursuit  just behind. We cannot block the 
line 20736=>door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it  opens inwards. We must  
line 20737=>do something to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of 
line 20738=>Mazarbul!' he said grimly feeling the edge of his sword, And®ril. 
line 20739=>     Heavy feet  were  heard in the corridor. Boromir  flung himself against  
line 20740=>the door  and heaved it to; then  he wedged it  with broken sword-blades and 
line 20741=>splinters of wood. The Company retreated  to the other  side of the chamber. 
line 20742=>But they had no chance to fly yet. There was a b low on the door that made it 
line 20743=>quiver;  and then it began  to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A 
line 20744=>huge  arm and shoulder, with  a  dark skin of  greenish scales,  was  thrust  
line 20745=>through  the  widening  gap.  Then a  great,  flat,  toeless foot was for ced 
line 20746=>through below. There was a dead silence outside. 
line 20747=>
line 20748=>####-     Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his 
line 20749=>sword  rang, glanced  aside, and  fell  from his shaken  hand. The blade was 
line 20750=>notched. 
line 20751=>     Suddenly, and to his  own surprise,  Frodo  felt a hot wrath blaze up in 
line 20752=>his heart. `The Shire! ' he cried, and springing beside Boromir, he stooped, 
line 20753=>and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot  
line 20754=>jerked back, nearly  wrenching  Sting from Frodo's arm.  Black dr ops dripped 
line 20755=>from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir  hurled  himself against the 
line 20756=>door and slammed it again. 
line 20757=>     `One for the Shire! '  cried  Aragorn. `The hobbit's bite is  deep! You  
line 20758=>have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo! ' 
line 20759=>     There was a crash  on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams  and 
line 20760=>hammers were  beating against it.  It cracked  and staggered  back,  and the 
line 20761=>opening grew  suddenly  wide.  Arrows  came  whistling  in, but  struck  the  
line 20762=>northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the floor . There  was a horn-blast and 
line 20763=>a rush of feet, and orcs one after another leaped into the chamber. 
line 20764=>     How many there were the Company could  not count. The affray was sharp, 
line 20765=>but the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of  the  defence. Legolas  shot 
line 20766=>two  through the throat.  Gimli hewed the legs from  under another that  had 
line 20767=>sprung up on Balin's  tomb. Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When thirteen 
line 20768=>had 
line 20769=>fallen the rest fled shrieking. leaving the  defenders unharmed, except  for  
line 20770=>Sam who had  a scratch along the scalp.  A  quick duck had saved him; and he 
line 20771=>had  felled  his  orc:  a sturdy  thrust with his  Barrow-blade. A  fire was 
line 20772=>smouldering  in his  brown  eyes  that would  have  made  Ted Sandyman  step 
line 20773=>backwards, if he had seen it. 
line 20774=>     `Now  is  the  time! ' cried  Gandalf.  `Let us  go,  before the  troll 
line 20775=>returns!' 
line 20776=>     But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the 
line 20777=>stair  outside,  a  huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black  mail 
line 20778=>from  head  to foot,  leaped  into  the chamber;  behind  him his  followers 
line 20779=>clustered in the doorway. His broad flat  face was swart, his eyes were like 
line 20780=>coals, and  his tongue  was red; he wielded a great  spear. With a thrust of 
line 20781=>his  huge hide shield he  turned  Boromir's  sword  and  bore him backwards,  
line 20782=>throwing him to  the ground. Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a  
line 20783=>striking  snake  he  charged  into  the Company  and  thrust with  his spear 
line 20784=>straight  at  Frodo.  The blow caught  him  on the right side, and Frodo was 
line 20785=>
line 20786=>####-hurled  against  the  wall and  pinned.  Sam,  with  a  cry, hacked  at  the 
line 20787=>spear-shaft, and it broke. But  even as the orc flung down the truncheon and  
line 20788=>swept  out his scimitar, And®ril came down upon his helm. There  was a flash 
line 20789=>like flame and the helm burst  asunder.  The orc fell with cloven  head. His 
line 20790=>followers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them. 
line 20791=>     Doom, doom went  the drums  in the  deep.  The  great voice  rolled out 
line 20792=>again. 
line 20793=>     'Now! ' shouted Gandalf. 'Now is the last chance. Run for it! ' 
line 20794=>     Aragorn picked up Frodo  where  he lay by the  wall and  made  for  the 
line 20795=>stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in  front  of him. The others followed;  but 
line 20796=>Gimli had  to be dragged away  by Legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered 
line 20797=>by  Balin's tomb  with his head bowed.  Boromir hauled the eastern  door to,  
line 20798=>grinding upon its hinges: it  had great iron rings on either side, but could 
line 20799=>not be fastened. 
line 20800=>     'I am all right,' gasped Frodo. `I can walk. Put me down! ' 
line 20801=>     Aragorn nearly dropped him in his  amazement. 'I thought you were dead! 
line 20802=>' he cried. 
line 20803=>     'Not yet! '  said Gandalf. 'But there is time  for wonder.  Off you go, 
line 20804=>all of you, down the stairs! Wait a few minutes for me at the bottom, but if 
line 20805=>I  do  not come soon, go on!  Go  quickly and choose paths leading right and 
line 20806=>downwards.' 
line 20807=>     'We cannot leave you to hold the door alone! ' said Aragorn. 
line 20808=>     `Do as I say! ' said Gandalf fiercely.  `Swords are no  more use  here. 
line 20809=>Go!' 
line 20810=>     The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their 
line 20811=>way down  a long  flight  of steps, and then looked back; but they could see 
line 20812=>nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer  of the wizard's staff. He 
line 20813=>seemed  to  be still  standing on guard by  the closed door.  Frodo breathed 
line 20814=>heavily  and  leaned  aga inst Sam, who  put his arms  about him.  They stood 
line 20815=>peering up  the  stairs  into the darkness. Frodo thought he could hear  the 
line 20816=>voice of  Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with 
line 20817=>a sighing  echo. He could not catch  what was said .  The  walls seemed to be 
line 20818=>trembling.  Every  now and again the drum-beats  throbbed and rolled:  doom, 
line 20819=>doom. 
line 20820=>     Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white  light. Then 
line 20821=>there  was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke  out wildly: 
line 20822=>
line 20823=>####-doom-boom, doom-boom, and then  stopped. Gandalf came flying down the  
line 20824=>steps 
line 20825=>and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company. 
line 20826=>     `Well, well! That's over!  ' said the wizard struggling to his feet. `I  
line 20827=>have done  all that I  could. But I have met my  match, and have nearly been 
line 20828=>destroyed. But don't stand here! Go  on! You  will have to  do without light 
line 20829=>for a  while: I am rather  shaken. Go on! Go on! Where are  you, Gimli? Come 
line 20830=>ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!' 
line 20831=>     They stumbled a fter him  wondering what had happened.  Doom,  doom 
line 20832=>went 
line 20833=>the drum-beats  again: they now sounded muffled and  far away, but they were 
line 20834=>following. There was no  other sound  of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor 
line 20835=>any  voice. Gandalf took  no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to 
line 20836=>be  going in the direction that he desired. Every now and again it descended  
line 20837=>a  flight of steps, fifty or more, to a  lower level. At the moment that was 
line 20838=>their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they 
line 20839=>came on it, and put their feet out into  emptiness.  Gandalf felt the ground 
line 20840=>with his staff like a blind man. 
line 20841=>     At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and 
line 20842=>had descended many flights of stairs. There was still  no sound  of pursuit. 
line 20843=>Almost  they  began to hope that they  would  escape. At the  bottom  of the  
line 20844=>seventh flight Gandalf halted. 
line 20845=>     `It is getting hot! ' he  gasped. `We ought to  be down at least to the 
line 20846=>level of the Gates now.  Soon I think we should look for  a left -hand turn to 
line 20847=>take us  east. I  hope  it is not far. I am very weary. I  must  rest here a  
line 20848=>moment, even if all the orcs ever spawned are after us.' 
line 20849=>     Gimli took  his arm and  helped  him down to a seat on the step.  `What 
line 20850=>happened away up there a t the  door? ' he asked. `Did you meet the beater of 
line 20851=>the drums?  ' 
line 20852=>     'I  do not know,' answered Gandalf. `But I found myself suddenly  faced 
line 20853=>by something  that I have not met before. I could think of nothing to do but 
line 20854=>to try and  put a  shutting-spell on the door. I know many; but to do things 
line 20855=>of that kind rightly requires time,  and even then the door can be broken by 
line 20856=>strength. 
line 20857=>     `As  I stood there  I could hear orc-voices on  the other  side: at any 
line 20858=>moment  I thought they would burst it open. I could not hear  what was said; 
line 20859=>they seemed to be talking in their  own hideous language.  All  I caught was 
line 20860=>
line 20861=>####-ghvsh;  that is  "fire". Then something came into the chamber  --  I felt it 
line 20862=>through  the door, and the orcs themselves were  afraid and fell  silent. It 
line 20863=>laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell. 
line 20864=>     'What it was  I cannot guess, but I have  never felt such  a challenge. 
line 20865=>The counter -spell was  terrible. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door  
line 20866=>left  my control and began to open!  I had  to speak a word of Command. That 
line 20867=>proved too great a strain.  The door burst in pieces.  Something  dark  as a  
line 20868=>cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down 
line 20869=>the stairs. All the wall gave way, and  the roof of  the  chamber as well, I 
line 20870=>think. 
line 20871=>     `I  am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something  else is buried 
line 20872=>there too. I  cannot say. But at least the passage behind  us was completely 
line 20873=>blocked.  Ah! I have never  felt  so spent, but it  is passing. And now what 
line 20874=>about  you, Frodo? There was not time to say  so, but I have never been more 
line 20875=>delighted in my life than when you spoke.  I feared that it was  a brave but 
line 20876=>dead hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.' 
line 20877=>     `What about me?  ' said  Frodo. 'I am  alive,  and whole I think. I  am 
line 20878=>bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.' 
line 20879=>     `Well,' said Aragorn, `I can only say that hobbits are made of  a stuff 
line 20880=>so tough  that I  have  never met the like of it. Had  I known, I would have 
line 20881=>spoken softer in the  Inn at  Bree! That spear-thrust would have  skewered a  
line 20882=>wild boar! ' 
line 20883=>     'Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad  to say,'  said Frodo; `though I 
line 20884=>feel  as  if I had been caught between  a hammer  and an anvil.' He  said no 
line 20885=>more. He found breathing painful. 
line 20886=>     'You take  after Bilbo,' said  Gandalf.  `There is  more about you than 
line 20887=>meets the  eye, as I said  of  him long ago.'  Frodo wondered  if the remark 
line 20888=>meant more than it said. 
line 20889=>     They  now went  on again. Before long Gimli spoke.  He had keen eyes in 
line 20890=>the dark. `I think,' he said, `that there  is a light  ahead. But it  is not 
line 20891=>daylight. It is red. What can it be? ' 
line 20892=>     `Ghvsh!' muttered  Gandalf. `I wonder if that is what they meant:  that 
line 20893=>the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.' 
line 20894=>     Soon the light became  unmistakable,  and could be  seen by all. It was 
line 20895=>flickering and glowing  on the walls away down the passage before them. They 
line 20896=>could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way 
line 20897=>ahead there stood  a low archway; through it the glowing light came. The air 
line 20898=>
line 20899=>####-became very hot. 
line 20900=>     When they came to the  arch  Gandalf  went through,  signing to them to 
line 20901=>wait.  As  he  stood just beyond the opening they saw his face  lit by a red 
line 20902=>glow. Quickly he stepped back. 
line 20903=>     `There is some new devi lry here,' he said, 'devised for our welcome  no 
line 20904=>doubt.  But I know now  where we are:  we  have reached the First Deep,  the 
line 20905=>level immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and 
line 20906=>the Gates are near: away beyond  the eastern end, on  the left, not more than 
line 20907=>a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair,  along a wide road 
line 20908=>through the First Hall, and out! But come and look! ' 
line 20909=>     They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier  
line 20910=>and far  longer than the one in which they had  slept. They  were  near  its 
line 20911=>eastern  end; westward it ran away into darkness. Down the  centre stalked a  
line 20912=>double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees 
line 20913=>whose boughs upheld  the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems 
line 20914=>were smooth and black, but a  red glow was  darkly mirrored  in their sides. 
line 20915=>Right  across the  floor, close  to the feet  of two  huge  pillars  a great 
line 20916=>fissure  had opened. Out of it a fierce  red light came,  and  now and aga in 
line 20917=>flames licked  at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps 
line 20918=>of dark smoke wavered in the hot air. 
line 20919=>     'If we had come by  the  main road down from the upper halls, we should  
line 20920=>have been trapped here,' said Gandalf.  `Let  us hope that the fire now lies 
line 20921=>between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.' 
line 20922=>     Even as he  spoke they heard again  the pursuing drum-beat: Doom, doom, 
line 20923=>doom.  Away  beyond the  shadows  at the western end of the  hall there came 
line 20924=>cries  and  horn-calls. Doom,  doom:  the pillars seemed  to tremble and the 
line 20925=>flames to quiver. 
line 20926=>     `Now for the  last race! ' said Gandalf. 'If the sun is shining outside 
line 20927=>we may still escape. After me!  ' 
line 20928=>     He  turned left  and  sped  across the smooth  floor of the  hall.  The 
line 20929=>distance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they heard the beat and 
line 20930=>echo  of  many  hurrying feet behind.  A shrill  yell went up: they had been 
line 20931=>seen. There was a  ring and clash of steel. An arrow  whistled over  Frodo's 
line 20932=>head. 
line 20933=>     Boromir laughed. `They did not expect this,' he said. `The fire has cut 
line 20934=>them off. We are on the wrong side! ' 
line 20935=>     `Look ahead! ' called Gandalf. `The Bridge is near. It is dangerous and 
line 20936=>
line 20937=>####-narrow.' 
line 20938=>     Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the 
line 20939=>floor vanished and fell to an unknown  depth. The outer door  could only  be 
line 20940=>reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the 
line 20941=>chasm with one curving  spring  of fifty feet. It was  an ancient defence of 
line 20942=>the Dwarves against  any enemy that  might  capture  the  First Hall and the 
line 20943=>outer passages. They  could only pass across it in single file. At the brink  
line 20944=>Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind. 
line 20945=>     'Lead  the way,  Gimli! ' he said. 'Pippin and  Merry next. Straight on 
line 20946=>and up the stair beyond the door! ' 
line 20947=>     Arrows  fell  among them. One  struck Frodo  and  sprang  back. Another  
line 20948=>pierced Gandalf's hat  and stuck there  like a black feather.  Frodo  looked 
line 20949=>behind. Beyond  the fire  he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to  be 
line 20950=>hundreds of orcs. They brandished spears and scimitars which  shone  red  as 
line 20951=>blood in the firelight. Doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and 
line 20952=>louder, doom, doom. 
line 20953=>     Legolas  turned and set an arrow to the  string, though it  was  a long 
line 20954=>shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to 
line 20955=>the ground. He  gave a cry of  dismay and  fear.  Two great trolls appeared; 
line 20956=>they bore  great slabs  of stone, and flung  them down to serve as  gangways 
line 20957=>over  the fire.  But  it was not the  trolls that  had filled the  Elf  with 
line 20958=>terror. The  ranks of the orcs had opened, and they crowded away, as if they 
line 20959=>themselves  were afraid.  Something was coming  up behind them.  What it was 
line 20960=>could not be seen:  it was like a grea t shadow, in the middle of which was a  
line 20961=>dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to 
line 20962=>be in it and to go before it. 
line 20963=>     It came to the edge of the fire and the  light faded as if a cloud  had 
line 20964=>bent  over it. Then with  a rush it leaped  across the fissure.  The  flames 
line 20965=>roared up to greet  it, and  wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in 
line 20966=>the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand 
line 20967=>was  a  blade like a stabbing tongue of fire;  in its left  it held a whip of 
line 20968=>many thongs. 
line 20969=>     'Ai! ai! ' wailed Legolas. 'A Balrog! A Balrog is come! ' 
line 20970=>     Gimli stared with wide eyes. `Durin's Bane! ' he cried, and letting his 
line 20971=>axe fall he covered his face. 
line 20972=>     'A  Balrog,' muttered  Gandalf.  `Now I  understand.'  He  faltered and 
line 20973=>leaned heavily on his staff. `What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.' 
line 20974=>
line 20975=>####-     The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled 
line 20976=>and  poured over the stone gangways.  Then Boromir raised his horn and blew.  
line 20977=>Loud  the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many  throats under 
line 20978=>the  cavernous  roof. For a  moment the orcs  quailed  and the  fiery shadow 
line 20979=>halted.  Then the  echoes died as suddenly as  a  flame blown out by a  dark 
line 20980=>wind, and the enemy advanced again. 
line 20981=>     'Over the bridge!' cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. `Fly! This is 
line 20982=>a foe beyond any  of you. I  must hold the narrow  way.  Fly! '  Aragorn and 
line 20983=>Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side,  
line 20984=>behind Gandalf a t the  far end of the bridge. The others halted  just within 
line 20985=>the doorway  at the hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their  leader to 
line 20986=>face the enemy alone. 
line 20987=>     The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, 
line 20988=>leaning on  the sta ff  in his left hand,  but  in his other  hand  Glamdring 
line 20989=>gleamed,  cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow 
line 20990=>about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs 
line 20991=>whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm. 
line 20992=>     `You cannot  pass,' he  said. The  orcs stood still, and a dead silence 
line 20993=>fell. `I  am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You  
line 20994=>cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udyn. Go back to  the 
line 20995=>Shadow! You cannot pass.' 
line 20996=>     The  Balrog made  no  answer.  The fire in  it seemed to die,  but  the 
line 20997=>darkness grew. It  stepped forward slowly on to  the bridge, and suddenly it 
line 20998=>drew  itself  up to a  great height, and its wings were spread from wall  to 
line 20999=>wall;  but still Gandalf could  be seen,  glimmering in the gloom; he seemed  
line 21000=>small, and altogether alone: grey  and bent, like a  wizened tree before the 
line 21001=>onset of a storm. 
line 21002=>     From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming. 
line 21003=>     Glamdring glittered white in answer. 
line 21004=>     There was a ringing clash and  a stab  of  white fire. The Balrog  fell 
line 21005=>back  and its  sword flew  up in molten  fragments. The wizard swayed on the 
line 21006=>bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still. 
line 21007=>     'You cannot pass! ' he said. 
line 21008=>     With a bound the  Balrog leaped full  upon the bridge. Its whip whirled 
line 21009=>and hissed. 
line 21010=>     'He cannot stand alone! ' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the 
line 21011=>bridge.  'Elendil!' he shouted. 'I am with you, Gandalf! ' 
line 21012=>
line 21013=>####-     `Gondor! ' cried Boromir and leaped after him. 
line 21014=>     At that moment Gandalf  lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the 
line 21015=>bridge  before  him.  The  staff broke asunder and  fell  from  his  hand. A 
line 21016=>blinding sheet of white  flame sprang  up. The  bridge cracked. Right at the 
line 21017=>Balrog's  feet it broke, and the stone  upon which it stood crashed into the 
line 21018=>gulf,  while the  rest  remained, poised,  quivering  like a tongue  of rock  
line 21019=>thrust out into emptiness.  
line 21020=>     With  a terrible  cry the Balrog fell  forward, and  its shadow plu nged 
line 21021=>down and vanished.  But  even as it  fell it swung  its whip, and the thongs 
line 21022=>lashed and curled  about the wizard's  knees, dragging him to the brink.  He 
line 21023=>staggered  and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid  into the  abyss. 
line 21024=>'Fly, you fools!  ' he cried, and was gone. 
line 21025=>     The fires went  out, and blank darkness  fell. The Company stood rooted 
line 21026=>with  horror staring  into the pit. Even  as Aragorn and Boromir came flying 
line 21027=>back, the rest  of the bridge cracked and  fell.  With a  cry Aragorn roused 
line 21028=>them. 
line 21029=>     'Come!  I  will lead you now!  '  he  called.  'We  must  obey his last  
line 21030=>command. Follow me!  ' 
line 21031=>     They  stumbled  wildly  up the great stairs beyond  the  door.  Aragorn 
line 21032=>leading, Boromir at the  rear. At the top was a  wide echoing passage. Along 
line 21033=>this they  fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then he found that 
line 21034=>he himself was  weeping as  he ran. Doom, doom,  doom the  drum-beats rolled 
line 21035=>behind, mournful now and slow; doom! 
line 21036=>     They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof.  
line 21037=>They ran  swifter. They passed into  a  hall, bright with daylight from  its 
line 21038=>high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors 
line 21039=>they passed,  and  suddenly before  them the Great Gates opened,  an arch of 
line 21040=>blazing ligh t. 
line 21041=>     There  was a guard of  orcs crouching in the  shadows behind the  great 
line 21042=>door posts towering on either  side,  but the gates were shattered and  cast 
line 21043=>down.  Aragorn smote to the ground the  captain that stood  in his path, and 
line 21044=>the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept  past them  and took  
line 21045=>no  heed  of them.  Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down  the  huge and 
line 21046=>age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria. 
line 21047=>     Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on 
line 21048=>their faces.  
line 21049=>     They did not  halt  until  they were  out  of bowshot from  the  walls.  
line 21050=>
line 21051=>####-Dimrill  Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it, 
line 21052=>but  eastwards there was a golden  light  on the land.  It was but one  hour 
line 21053=>after noon. The sun was shining; the clouds were white and high. 
line 21054=>     They looked  back.  Dark yawned  the  archway  of  the Gates  under the 
line 21055=>mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats:  
line 21056=>doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the  dale 
line 21057=>all  around was empty.  Doom. Grief  at last  wholly overcame them, and they 
line 21058=>wept long: some standing and silent, some  cast upon the ground. Doom, doom. 
line 21059=>The drum-beats faded. 
line 21060=> 
line 21061=>
line 21062=>####- 
line 21063=>
line 21064=>Chapter 6. Lothlurien 
line 21065=>
line 21066=> 
line 21067=> 
line 21068=>     'Alas! I  Fear  we cannot  stay here longer,'  said  Aragorn. He looked 
line 21069=>towards the mountains and held up his sword. `Farewell, Gandalf! ' he cried.  
line 21070=>'Did I  not say to you: if  you pass the doors of Moria, beware? Alas that I 
line 21071=>spoke true! What hope have we without you?  ' 
line 21072=>     He turned to the Company. `We must do without hope,' he said. `At least  
line 21073=>we may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep no more! Come! We 
line 21074=>have 
line 21075=>a long road, and much to do.' 
line 21076=>     They rose and looked about  them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen  
line 21077=>of shadows between  two great arms of the mountains, above which three white 
line 21078=>peaks were shining:  Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras. the Mountains of Moria. 
line 21079=>At the head of  the glen a torrent flowed  like a white lace over an endless 
line 21080=>ladder  of short  falls,  and  a   mist of foam  hung in the  air  about  the 
line 21081=>mountains' feet. 
line 21082=>     `Yonder is the Dimrill  Stair,'  said  Aragorn,  pointing to the falls. 
line 21083=>'Down  the  deep-cloven way that climbs beside  the torrent  we should  have 
line 21084=>come, if fortune had been kinder.' 
line 21085=>     `Or Caradhras less cruel,' said Gimli. `There he stands smiling in  the 
line 21086=>sun! ' He shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped peaks and turned 
line 21087=>away. 
line 21088=>     To the east the outflung arm of  the mountains marched to a sudden end, 
line 21089=>and far lands  could be  descried beyond  them, wide and vague. To the south 
line 21090=>the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than 
line 21091=>a  mile away, and a  little below them, for they still stood high up on  the 
line 21092=>west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a  
line 21093=>great spear-head thrust  deep  into the northern glen; but its  southern end 
line 21094=>was  beyond the  shadows under the sunlit sky. Yet  its  waters were dark: a  
line 21095=>deep blue  like  clear evening sky seen from  a lamp-lit room. Its face  was 
line 21096=>still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides 
line 21097=>to its bare unbroken rim. 
line 21098=>     `There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled -zvram! ' said  Gimli sadly.  `I  
line 21099=>remember that he said: "May you have joy of  the sight! But we cannot linger 
line 21100=>there."  Now long shall I journey ere  I have  joy again. It is  I that must 
line 21101=>
line 21102=>####-hasten away, and he that must remain.' 
line 21103=>     The  Company now went down  the road from the Gates.  It was  rough and 
line 21104=>broken,  fading to a winding track between heather and whin  that thrust amid 
line 21105=>the cracking stones. But still it could  be seen  that once long ago a great 
line 21106=>paved way  had  wound upwards from  the lowlands of  the  Dwarf-kingdom.  
line 21107=>In 
line 21108=>places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green 
line 21109=>topped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in  the wind. An  eastward 
line 21110=>bend led them  hard by the sward of  Mirrormere,  and there not far from the 
line 21111=>roadside stood a single column broken at the top. 
line 21112=>     'That  is Durin's Stone! ' cried Gimli. `I cannot  pass without turning 
line 21113=>aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale! ' 
line 21114=>     `Be swift  then! ' said  Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates.  `The 
line 21115=>Sun sinks early. The Orcs will  not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we 
line 21116=>must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, and it will  be 
line 21117=>dark tonight.' 
line 21118=>     'Come with me,  Frodo! ' cried the dwarf,  springing from the  road. `I  
line 21119=>would not have  you  go without  seeing Kheled-zvram.'  He ran down the long 
line 21120=>green slope. Frodo followed slowly,  drawn by the still blue water in  spite 
line 21121=>of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind. 
line 21122=>     Beside  the  standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It  was cracked 
line 21123=>and weather -worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. `This 
line 21124=>pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked  in the Mirrormere,' said the 
line 21125=>dwarf. 'Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!' 
line 21126=>     They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then 
line 21127=>slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profou nd 
line 21128=>blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there 
line 21129=>was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars,  
line 21130=>though sunlight was in  the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow 
line 21131=>could be seen. 
line 21132=>     'O Kheled-zvram fair and wonderful! ' said Gimli. `There lies the Crown  
line 21133=>of Durin till he wakes.  Farewell! ' He bowed, and turned away, and hastened 
line 21134=>back up the green-sward to the road again. 
line 21135=>     `What  did  you see?  '  said Pippin to Sam, but  Sam was  too deep  in 
line 21136=>thought to answer. 
line 21137=>     The road now  turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from 
line 21138=>between the arms of  the dale. Some  way  below the mere they came on a deep 
line 21139=>
line 21140=>####-well of water, clear as crystal,  from which a freshet fell over a stone lip 
line 21141=>and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel. 
line 21142=>     'Here is  the spring from  which the Silverlode rises.' said Gimli. `Do 
line 21143=>not drink of it! It is icy cold.' 
line 21144=>     'Soon it becomes a swift river, and  it  gathers water from  many other  
line 21145=>mountain-streams,' said Aragorn.  `Our road leads beside it for  many miles.  
line 21146=>For I  shall take you  by the road that  Gandalf chose, and first I hope  to 
line 21147=>come to  the woods  where  the  Silverlode  flows into the  Great  River -out 
line 21148=>yonder.'  They looked as  he  pointed,  and before  them  they  could see the 
line 21149=>stream  leaping  down to the trough of the  valley, and then  running on and 
line 21150=>away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze. 
line 21151=>     `There  lie  the  woods of Lothlurien! '  said  Legolas. `That  is  the 
line 21152=>fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees 
line 21153=>of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not 
line 21154=>till the  spring comes and  the  new green opens  do they fall, and then the 
line 21155=>boughs are  laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the  wood is golden,  
line 21156=>and golden is the  roof, and its  pillars are of silver, for the bark of the 
line 21157=>trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would 
line 21158=>be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime! ' 
line 21159=>     `My heart will be glad, even in the winter,' said Aragorn. 'But it lies 
line 21160=>many miles away. Let us hasten! ' 
line 21161=>     For some  time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with  the  others;  but 
line 21162=>Aragorn was  leading them at  a great  pace,  and  after a while they lagged 
line 21163=>behind.  They  had eaten nothing  since  the  early morning.  Sam's cut  was 
line 21164=>burning like fire, and his head felt light.  In spite of the shining sun the 
line 21165=>wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria.  He shivered. Frodo felt 
line 21166=>every step more painful and he gasped for breath. 
line 21167=>     At last Legolas turned, and seeing  them  now far behind,  he spoke  to 
line 21168=>Aragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling to Boromir to come 
line 21169=>with him. 
line 21170=>     'I am sorry,  Frodo!  ' he cried, full of concern. `So much has happened 
line 21171=>this day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were 
line 21172=>hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease 
line 21173=>you, 
line 21174=>as we ought, though all the orcs of Moria were after  us. Come now! A little 
line 21175=>further on there is a place  where we can rest for a little. There I will do 
line 21176=>what I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.' 
line 21177=>
line 21178=>####-     Soon afterwards they came  upon another stream that ran down  from  the 
line 21179=>west, and joined  its  bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode. Together  
line 21180=>they plunged over a fall of green-hued  stone, and foamed  down into a dell.  
line 21181=>About  it stood fir-trees, short and bent,  and  its  sides were  steep  and 
line 21182=>clothed with harts-tongue  and shrubs of whortle-berry. At the  bottom there 
line 21183=>was  a level  space  through  which the stream flowed  noisily  over shining 
line 21184=>pebbles. Here they rested.  It was now  nearly three hours  after noon,  and 
line 21185=>they  had  come  only  a few  miles  from  the  Gates. Already  the sun  was 
line 21186=>westering. 
line 21187=>     While Gimli and the two  younger hobbits kindled a  fire of brush-  and 
line 21188=>fir-wood, and drew  water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. Sam's wound was 
line 21189=>not 
line 21190=>deep, but  it looked ugly, and  Aragorn's face  was grave as he examined it. 
line 21191=>After a moment he looked up with relief.  
line 21192=>     'Good luck, Sam! '  he said. 'Many  have received worse  than  this  in 
line 21193=>payment for the slaying of their first orc. The  cut is not poisoned, as the 
line 21194=>wounds of orc-blades too often are. It should  heal well when  I have tended 
line 21195=>it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water.' 
line 21196=>     He opened his pouch  and drew out  some withered leaves.  `They are dry 
line 21197=>and some of their virtue has one, he said, but here I have still some of the 
line 21198=>leaves of athelas that I gathered near Weather top. Crush  one in the  water, 
line 21199=>and wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your turn. Frodo! ' 
line 21200=>     'I am all right,'  said Frodo, reluctant  to have his garments touched. 
line 21201=>`AII I needed was some food and a little rest.' 
line 21202=>     `No! ' said Aragorn. `We must have a  look and see what the  hammer and 
line 21203=>the  anvil have  done  to you. I still marvel  that  you are  alive at all.' 
line 21204=>Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of 
line 21205=>wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered  before his eyes  like 
line 21206=>the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it  off and held it up, and 
line 21207=>the gems on it glittered like stars.  and the sound of the shaken rings  was 
line 21208=>like the tinkle of rain in a pool. 
line 21209=>     `Look, my friends!' he called.  `H ere's a pretty hobbit -skin to wrap an 
line 21210=>elven-princeling in! If it were known that  hobbits had  such hides, all the 
line 21211=>hunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the Shire.' 
line 21212=>     `And all the arrows of all the hunters  in the world would be in vain,' 
line 21213=>said  Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. `It is a mithril-coat. Mithril! I 
line 21214=>have never seen or  heard tell of one so fair. Is this the coat that Gandalf 
line 21215=>
line 21216=>####-spoke of? Then he undervalued it. But it was well given! ' 
line 21217=>     `I have  often wondered what you and Bilbo  wer e doing, so close in his 
line 21218=>little room,'  said Merry. 'Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever. 
line 21219=>I hope we get a chance of telling him about it! ' 
line 21220=>     There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast. 
line 21221=>Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings 
line 21222=>had been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo's left side also was scored 
line 21223=>and bruised where he had been hurled against the  wall. While the others set  
line 21224=>the  food ready.  Aragorn  bathed the hurts  with wa ter in which athelas was 
line 21225=>steeped. The pungent fragrance filled  the dell, and all  those who  stooped 
line 21226=>over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the 
line 21227=>pain leave him,  and his breath grew  easy: though he was stiff and sore  to 
line 21228=>the touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side.  
line 21229=>     `The mail is marvellously light,' he said. `Put it on again, if you can 
line 21230=>bear it. My heart is glad  to know that you have  such a coat. Do not lay it 
line 21231=>aside, even  in sleep,  unless fortune brings you where you  are safe for  a  
line 21232=>while; and that will seldom chance while your quest lasts.' 
line 21233=>     When they  had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They  put out the  
line 21234=>fire and hid all  traces of it. Then climbing out of the dell they  took  to 
line 21235=>the  road  again.  They  had  not  gone far before the sun  sank  behind the 
line 21236=>westward  heights  and  great  shadows crept down  the mountain-sides.  Dusk  
line 21237=>veiled their  feet,  and  mist  rose in the hollows. Away  in  the east  the 
line 21238=>evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood. Sam and 
line 21239=>Frodo  now  feeling eased  and greatly refreshed were  able  to go at a fair 
line 21240=>pace,  and  with only one brief halt Aragorn  led the Company on  for nearly 
line 21241=>three more hours.  
line 21242=>     It was  dark. Deep  night had fallen. There  were  many clear stars, hut 
line 21243=>the fast -waning moon  would not be seen till late. Gimli  and  Frodo were at 
line 21244=>the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound  upon the 
line 21245=>road behind. At length Gimli broke the silence. 
line 21246=>     'Not a sound but the wind,' he  said. `There are no goblins near, or my 
line 21247=>ears are made of wood. It is to be  hoped that the Orcs will be content with 
line 21248=>driving us from Moria. And maybe that was  all their  purpose, and  they had 
line 21249=>nothing else to do with u s-with the Ring. Though Orcs will often pursue foes 
line 21250=>for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.' 
line 21251=>     Frodo  did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade  was dull. Yet 
line 21252=>he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon a s the shadows had fallen 
line 21253=>
line 21254=>####-about them and the  road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter 
line 21255=>of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams 
line 21256=>of light behind, or for a moment he thought he  saw  them, but at once  they 
line 21257=>slipped aside and vanished. 
line 21258=>     `What is it? ' said the dwarf.  
line 21259=>     `I don't know.' answered Frodo. 'I thought I heard feet,  and I thought 
line 21260=>I saw a light -like  eyes. I  have thought so  often, since we first  entered 
line 21261=>Moria.' 
line 21262=>     Gimli  halted and  stooped  to  the  ground. 'I  hear  nothing but  the 
line 21263=>night-speech of plant  and stone,'  he said. 'Come! Let us hurry! The others 
line 21264=>are out of sight.' 
line 21265=>     The  night-wind  blew  chill up the valley to  meet them. Before them a  
line 21266=>wide  grey shadow loomed, and  they heard an endless  rustle of leaves  like 
line 21267=>poplars in the breeze. 
line 21268=>     `Lothlurien! ' cried Legolas. 'Lothlurien! We have come to the eaves of 
line 21269=>the Golden Wood. Alas that it is winter! ' 
line 21270=>     Under  the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road 
line 21271=>and stream that  ran suddenly  beneath their  spreading  boughs. In  the dim 
line 21272=>light of  the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint 
line 21273=>of fallow gold. 
line 21274=>     'Lothlurien! '  said  Aragorn. 'Glad I am to hear again the wind in the 
line 21275=>trees! We are still little more than five leagues from the Gates, but we can 
line 21276=>go no further. Here  let  us hope that the virtue of the Elves will  keep us 
line 21277=>tonight from the peril that comes behind.' 
line 21278=>     `If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,' said Gimli. 
line 21279=>     'It is long since any  of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land 
line 21280=>whence we wandered in ages long ago,' said Legolas, 'but we hear that Lurien 
line 21281=>is not yet deserted, for there is a  secret power here  that holds evil from 
line 21282=>the land.  Nevertheless its folk are seldom  seen, and maybe they  dwell now  
line 21283=>deep in the woods and far from the northern border.' 
line 21284=>     'Indeed deep  in the  wood they dwell,' said Aragorn, and sighed as  if 
line 21285=>some memory stirred in him. `We must fend for ourselves tonight.  We will go 
line 21286=>forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn 
line 21287=>aside from the path and seek a place to rest in.' 
line 21288=>     He stepped forward; but Boromir  stood irresolute and did  not  follow.  
line 21289=>'Is there no other way?  ' he said. 
line 21290=>     `What other fairer way would you desire? ' said Aragorn. 
line 21291=>
line 21292=>####-     `A plain road, though it  led through a hedge of swords,' said Boromir. 
line 21293=>`By  strange  paths has this Company been  led, and so far  to evil fortune. 
line 21294=>Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria, to our loss. And now we 
line 21295=>must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we have heard 
line 21296=>in  Gondor, and it is said that few come out who once go in; and of that few  
line 21297=>none have escaped unscathed.' 
line 21298=>     `Say not unscathed, but if you say unchanged, then maybe you will speak 
line 21299=>the truth said Aragorn. But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of 
line 21300=>those who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlurien. Believe what you  
line 21301=>will,  there  is no other  way  for  us  --  unless  you  would  go  back  to 
line 21302=>Moria -gate, or  scale the pathless mountains, or swim the  Great  River  all 
line 21303=>alone.' 
line 21304=>     `Then lead on! ' said Boromir. `But it is perilous.' 
line 21305=>     `Perilous indeed,' said Aragorn, 'fair and perilous; but only evil need 
line 21306=>fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow me!  ' 
line 21307=>     They  had gone  little more than a mile into the  forest when they came 
line 21308=>upon  another  stream flowing  down swiftly from  the tree-clad  slopes that 
line 21309=>climbed back westward towards the mountains.  They heard it splashing over a  
line 21310=>fall away among the shadows on  their  right. Its dark  hurrying waters  ran 
line 21311=>across the path before  them, and joined  the Silverlode in a  swirl  of dim 
line 21312=>pools among the roots of trees.  
line 21313=>     `Here is Nimrodel! ' said  Legolas.  'Of this stream  the Silvan  Elves 
line 21314=>made  many songs long ago, and still we sing them  in the North, remembering 
line 21315=>the rainbow on its falls, and the  golden flowers  that floated in its foam. 
line 21316=>All is  dark now  and the Bridge of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my 
line 21317=>feet, for it  is said that  the water is  healing to  the  weary.'  He  went 
line 21318=>forward and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream. 
line 21319=>     `Follow me!' he  cried. 'The water is not deep. Let us wade  across! On 
line 21320=>the  further bank we can rest. and  the sound of the falling water may bring 
line 21321=>us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.' 
line 21322=>     One by one they  climbed down and followed Legolas. For  a moment Frodo 
line 21323=>stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet. It was cold 
line 21324=>but its touch was clean, and  as he went on and it  mounted to his knees, he 
line 21325=>felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs.  
line 21326=>     When all  the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little 
line 21327=>food; and Legolas  told them  tales of Lothlurien that the Elves of Mirkwood  
line 21328=>still  kept  in their  hearts, of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by 
line 21329=>
line 21330=>####-the Great River before the world was grey. 
line 21331=>     At  length  a  silence fell, and they  heard the music of the waterfall 
line 21332=>running sweetly  in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that he  could  hear a 
line 21333=>voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water. 
line 21334=>     `Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel? ' asked Legolas. 'I will sing you a  
line 21335=>song  of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same  name  as the stream  besi de 
line 21336=>which she lived lung ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this 
line 21337=>is how it runs in the  Westron Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.' In 
line 21338=>a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them  he 
line 21339=>began: 
line 21340=>     An Elven-maid there was of old, 
line 21341=>     A shining star by day: 
line 21342=>     Her mantle white was hemmed with gold, 
line 21343=>     Her shoes of silver-grey. 
line 21344=> 
line 21345=>     A star was bound upon her brows, 
line 21346=>     A light was on her hair 
line 21347=>     As sun upon the golden boughs 
line 21348=>     In Lurien the fair. 
line 21349=> 
line 21350=>     Her hair was long, her limbs were white, 
line 21351=>     And fair she was and free; 
line 21352=>     And in the wind she went as light 
line 21353=>     As leaf of linden-tree. 
line 21354=> 
line 21355=>     Beside the falls of Nimrodel, 
line 21356=>     By water clear and cool, 
line 21357=>     Her voice as falling silver fell 
line 21358=>     Into the shining pool. 
line 21359=> 
line 21360=>     Where now she wanders none can tell, 
line 21361=>     In sunlight or in shade; 
line 21362=>     For lost of yore was Nimrodel 
line 21363=>     And in the mountains strayed. 
line 21364=> 
line 21365=>     The elven-ship in haven grey 
line 21366=>     Beneath the mountain -lee 
line 21367=>
line 21368=>####-     Awaited her for many a day 
line 21369=>     Beside the roaring sea. 
line 21370=> 
line 21371=>     A wind by night in Northern lands 
line 21372=>     Arose, and loud it cried, 
line 21373=>     And drove the ship from elven-strands 
line 21374=>     Across the streaming tide. 
line 21375=> 
line 21376=>     When dawn came dim the land was lost, 
line 21377=>     The mountains sinking grey 
line 21378=>     Beyond the heaving waves that tossed 
line 21379=>     Their plumes of blinding spray. 
line 21380=> 
line 21381=>     Amroth beheld the fading shore 
line 21382=>     Now low beyond the swell, 
line 21383=>     And cursed the faithless ship that bore 
line 21384=>     Him far from Nimrodel. 
line 21385=> 
line 21386=>     Of old he was an Elven-king, 
line 21387=>     A lord of tree and glen, 
line 21388=>     When golden were the boughs in spring 
line 21389=>     In fair Lothlurien. 
line 21390=> 
line 21391=>     From helm to sea they saw him leap, 
line 21392=>     As arrow from the string, 
line 21393=>     And dive into the water deep, 
line 21394=>     As mew upon the wing. 
line 21395=> 
line 21396=>     The wind was in his flowing hair, 
line 21397=>     The foam about him shone; 
line 21398=>     Afar they saw him strong and fair 
line 21399=>     Go riding like a swan. 
line 21400=> 
line 21401=>     But from the West has come no word, 
line 21402=>     And on the Hither Shore 
line 21403=>     No tidings Elven-folk have heard 
line 21404=>     Of Amroth evermore. 
line 21405=>
line 21406=>####-     The voice of Legolas faltered, and the  song ceased. 'I cannot sing any 
line 21407=>more,' he said. 'That is  but a part, for I have forgotten much.  It is long 
line 21408=>and  sad,  for  it  tells  how sorrow came  upon Lothlurien,  Lurien  of the 
line 21409=>Blossom, when the Dwarves awakened  evil in the mountains.' 
line 21410=>     `But the Dwarves did not make the evil,' said Gimli. 
line 21411=>     `I said not  so; yet evil came,' answered Legolas sadly.  `Then many of 
line 21412=>the Elves  of  Nimrodel's kindred left their dwellings and departed  and she 
line 21413=>was  lost far in  the South, in  the passes of the White Mountains;  and she 
line 21414=>came  not to  the ship where  Amroth her  lover waited for  her. But  in the 
line 21415=>spring when the wind is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be  
line 21416=>heard by the falls that bear her name. And when the wind is in the South the 
line 21417=>voice  of Amroth comes up from the sea; for  Nimrodel flows into Silverlode, 
line 21418=>that Elves call Celebrant, and Celebrant into Anduin  the Great. and  Anduin 
line 21419=>flows into  the  Bay of Belfalas  whence the  Elves of Lurien set  sa il. But 
line 21420=>neither Nimrodel nor Amroth ever came back. 
line 21421=>     'It is told  that she had a house built in the branches  of a tree that 
line 21422=>grew  near the falls; for that  was the custom  of the  Elves of  Lurien, to 
line 21423=>dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Ther efore they were called the 
line 21424=>Galadhrim, the Tree-people. Deep  in  their forest the trees are very great. 
line 21425=>The people of the woods did not delve in the  ground like Dwarves, nor build 
line 21426=>strong places of stone before the Shadow came.' 
line 21427=>     `And even in  these la tter days dwelling in the trees might  be thought 
line 21428=>safer than sitting on the  ground,' said  Gimli. He looked across the stream 
line 21429=>to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then up into the roof of dark 
line 21430=>boughs above. 
line 21431=>     `Your  words bring good counsel, Gimli,' said Aragorn. `We cannot build 
line 21432=>a house, but  tonight we  will do as the Galadhrim  and seek  refuge  in the 
line 21433=>tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside  the road  already longer than 
line 21434=>was wise.' 
line 21435=>     The Company now turned aside from the path, and  went into the shadow of 
line 21436=>the deeper woods,  westward along  the mountain-stream away from 
line 21437=>Silverlode. 
line 21438=>Not  far from the falls of Nimrodel they  found a cluster of trees,  some of 
line 21439=>which overhung the stream. Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but 
line 21440=>their height could not be guessed. 
line 21441=>     `I will climb up,' said  Legolas. `I am at home among trees, by root or  
line 21442=>bough, though  these  trees are of a kind strange to  me, save as  a name in 
line 21443=>
line 21444=>####-song.  Mellyrn  they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, 
line 21445=>but I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is  their shape and way 
line 21446=>of growth.' 
line 21447=>     `Whatever  it may be,'  said Pippin,  `they  will be  marvellous  trees 
line 21448=>indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds. I cannot  sleep 
line 21449=>on a perch! ' 
line 21450=>     'Then dig a hole in the  ground,' said Legolas, `if that  is more after 
line 21451=>the fashion of your kind. But  you  must dig swift and deep, if you  wish to 
line 21452=>hide from Orcs.' He sprang  lightly up from the ground  and  caught a branch 
line 21453=>that grew from the trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for 
line 21454=>a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him. 
line 21455=>     `Daro!'  it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to  earth 
line 21456=>in surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree. 
line 21457=>     'Stand still! ' he whispered to the others. `Do not move or speak! ' 
line 21458=>     There  was a sound  of soft laughter over their heads, and then another  
line 21459=>clear voice spoke in an  elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what 
line 21460=>was  said, for the speech that the  Silvan folk east of the  mountains  used 
line 21461=>among themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and 
line 21462=>answered 
line 21463=>in the same language.* 
line 21464=>     `Who are they, and what do they say? ' asked Merry. 
line 21465=>     `They're Elves,' said Sam. `Can't  you hear their voices? ' 
line 21466=>     `Yes, they are Elves,'  said Legolas; `and they say that you breathe so 
line 21467=>loud that they could  shoot you in the dark.' Sam  hastily put his hand over 
line 21468=>his mouth.  'But they say also that  you need have  no fear. They have  been 
line 21469=>aware of us for a long while. They heard  my  voice across the Nimrodel, and 
line 21470=>knew that I  was one of their  Northern kindred, and therefore they did  not 
line 21471=>hinder our  crossing; and  afterwards  they  heard  my song. Now they bid me 
line 21472=>climb up  with Frodo;  for they seem  to have had some tidings of him and of 
line 21473=>our journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep  watch at  the 
line 21474=>foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done.' 
line 21475=>     Out of  the  shadows a  ladder  was  let  down:  it  was made  of rope, 
line 21476=>silver -grey and  glimmering  in the dark, and  though it looked  slender  it 
line 21477=>proved  strong enough to bear  many men. Legolas ran  lightly up, and  Frodo 
line 21478=>followed slowly; behind  came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches 
line 21479=>of the mallorn-tree grew  out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept 
line 21480=>upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown  of many boughs,  
line 21481=>
line 21482=>####-and  among these they  found that there had been built a wooden platform, or 
line 21483=>flet as such things were called in those days: the  Elves called it a talan. 
line 21484=>It  was  reached  by a round hole in  the  centre  through  which the ladder  
line 21485=>passed. 
line 21486=>     When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated  with 
line 21487=>three other Elves. They were clad  in  shadowy-grey, and could  not  be seen 
line 21488=>among  the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of 
line 21489=>them uncovered a small lamp that  gave out a slender silver beam. He held it 
line 21490=>up,  looking at Frodo's face,  and Sam's. Then he shut  off the light again, 
line 21491=>and  spoke words of welcome in  his elven-tongue.  Frodo  spoke haltingly in 
line 21492=>return. 
line 21493=>     `Welcome!' the Elf then said  again in the  Common  Language,  speaking 
line 21494=>slowly. 'We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart 
line 21495=>of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings  with any other folk. Even 
line 21496=>our own kindred in the North are sundered from us. But there  are some of us 
line 21497=>still  who  go  abroad  for  the gathering  of news and the watching  of our 
line 21498=>enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my  
line 21499=>name. My brothers, R®mil and Orophin, speak little of your tongue. 
line 21500=>     `But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of Elrond 
line 21501=>passed by Lurien on their way home up the Dimrill Stair. We had not heard of 
line 21502=>hobbits, or halflings, for many a long year,  and did not know  that any yet 
line 21503=>dwelt in Middle-earth. You do not  look evil! And since you come with an Elf 
line 21504=>of our  kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as  Elrond asked; though it 
line 21505=>is not our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here 
line 21506=>tonight. How many are you? ' 
line 21507=>     `Eight,' said Legolas. `Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom, 
line 21508=>Aragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.' 
line 21509=>     `The  name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lurien,' said Haldir, 
line 21510=>`and  he  has the favour of  the  Lady. All then is  well.  But you have yet 
line 21511=>spoken only of seven.' 
line 21512=>     `The eighth is a dwarf,' said Legolas. 
line 21513=>     `A dwarf! '  said Haldir. `That  is not well. We have not had  dealings 
line 21514=>wi th  the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I  
line 21515=>cannot allow him to pass.' 
line 21516=>     `But  he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of  Dbin's trusty people, and 
line 21517=>friendly to Elrond,' said Frodo. `Elrond himself  chose him to be one of our 
line 21518=>companions, and he has been brave and faithful.' 
line 21519=>
line 21520=>####-     The  Elves  spoke together in  soft  voices, and questioned Legolas  in 
line 21521=>their own tongue. 'Very good,' said Haldir at last. `We will do this, though 
line 21522=>it is against our liking. If  Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer  
line 21523=>for him, he shall pass; but he must go blindfold through Lothlurien. 
line 21524=>     `But now  we must debate  no  longer. Your folk  must not remain on the 
line 21525=>ground. We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever since we saw a  great 
line 21526=>troop of Orcs  going north toward Moria, along  the skirts of the mountains,  
line 21527=>many days ago. Wolves  are howling on the wood's borders. If you have indeed 
line 21528=>come from Moria, the peril cannot  be far behind. Tomorrow early you must go 
line 21529=>on. 
line 21530=>     'The four hobbits shall c limb up here  and  stay with us-we do not fear 
line 21531=>them! There is  another talan in  the next tree.  There the others must take 
line 21532=>refuge.  You, Legolas, must answer to us for them. Call  us, if  anything is 
line 21533=>amiss! And have an eye on that dwarf!' 
line 21534=>     Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir's message; and soon  
line 21535=>afterwards Merry and Pippin  clambered up on to the high flet. They were out 
line 21536=>of breath and seemed rather scared. 
line 21537=>     `There!' said Merry  panting. `We  have lugged up your blankets as well 
line 21538=>as  our own. Strider has hidden all the rest of  the baggage in a deep drift 
line 21539=>of leaves.' 
line 21540=>     `You had no  need  of your burdens,' said  Haldir. `It is  cold in  the 
line 21541=>tree-tops in  winter, though the wind tonight is  in the  South; but we have 
line 21542=>food and drink to give you that will drive away the night -chill, and we have 
line 21543=>skins and cloaks to spare.' 
line 21544=>     The  hobbits accepted this  second (and far better) supper very gladly. 
line 21545=>Then they  wrapped themselves warmly,  not only  in  the fur-cloaks  of  the 
line 21546=>Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and  tried  to  go  to  sleep. But 
line 21547=>weary  as  they  were only  Sam found that  easy to  do. Hobbits do not like 
line 21548=>heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet 
line 21549=>was not at  all to their liking as a  bedroom.  It had  no walls. not even a  
line 21550=>rail; only on one side  was there a  light  plaited  screen,  which could be 
line 21551=>moved and fixed in different places according to the wind. 
line 21552=>     Pippin went on  talking for a while. `I  hope, if I  do  go to sleep in 
line 21553=>this bed-loft, that I shan't roll off,' he said. 
line 21554=>     `Once I do get to sleep,' said Sam, 'i  shall go on sleeping, whether I 
line 21555=>roll off or no. And the less said,  the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my 
line 21556=>meaning.' 
line 21557=>
line 21558=>####-     Frodo  lay  for some  time awake,  and looked up  at the stars glinting 
line 21559=>through the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring at his  side long 
line 21560=>before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see  the grey forms of two  
line 21561=>elves  sitting motionless  with their  arms about  their  knees, speaking in 
line 21562=>whispers. The other had  gone down to take up  his watch on one of the lower  
line 21563=>branches. At  last lulled by the wind in the  boughs above,  and  the  sweet 
line 21564=>murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below,  Frodo  fell  asleep with the song of 
line 21565=>Legolas running in his mind. 
line 21566=>     Late in the  night he awoke. The  other hobbits were  asleep. The Elves 
line 21567=>were gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind 
line 21568=>was 
line 21569=>still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on 
line 21570=>the ground below. There was a ring of  metal. The sounds died  slowly  away, 
line 21571=>and seemed to go southward, on into the wood. 
line 21572=>     A head  appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in  
line 21573=>alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked towards the hobbits. 
line 21574=>     `What is it? ' said Frodo. 
line 21575=>     `Yrch!' said  the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the 
line 21576=>rope-ladder rolled up. 
line 21577=>     'Orcs! ' said Frodo. `What are they doing? ' But the Elf had gone. 
line 21578=>     There were  no more  sounds. Even the leaves were silent,  and the very 
line 21579=>falls  seemed  to  be hushed.  Frodo sat and  shivered in his wraps. He  was 
line 21580=>thankful that they had not been  caught on the ground; but he felt  that the 
line 21581=>trees offered little  protection, except concealment.  Orcs were  as keen as 
line 21582=>hounds on  a scent, it  was  said, but they could  also climb.  He drew  out 
line 21583=>Sting: it flashed and glittered  like a  blue  flame  and then  slowly faded 
line 21584=>again and grew dull. In  spite  of the  fading of his  sword  the feeling of 
line 21585=>immediate danger did no t leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and 
line 21586=>crawled to the opening and peered  down. He was almost certain that he could 
line 21587=>hear stealthy movements at the tree's foot far below. 
line 21588=>     Not Elves; for  the  woodland folk were  altogether noiseless in  their 
line 21589=>movements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed 
line 21590=>to  be  scrabbling on the bark of  the tree-trunk. He  stared down into  the 
line 21591=>dark, holding his breath. 
line 21592=>     Something was now  climbing slowly, and  its breath  came  like a   soft 
line 21593=>hissing through closed teeth. Then coming  up, close  to the stem, Frodo saw 
line 21594=>
line 21595=>####-two pale eyes. They stopped and gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they 
line 21596=>turned 
line 21597=>away, and a shadowy figure slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished. 
line 21598=>     Immediately  afterwards Haldir  came  climbing swiftly  up through  the 
line 21599=>branches. `There was something in this tree that I have never seen  before,' 
line 21600=>he said. `It was not an orc. It fled as  soon as I touched the tree-stem. It 
line 21601=>seemed to be wary, and to have some skill in trees, or I  might have thought  
line 21602=>that it was one of you hobbits.  
line 21603=>     'I did not  shoot, for I  dared not arouse any  cries:  we cannot  risk  
line 21604=>battle. A strong company of Orcs has passed. They crossed the Nimrodel-curse 
line 21605=>their foul feet in its clean water!-and went on down the old road beside the 
line 21606=>river. They seemed to pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a 
line 21607=>while near the place where you halted. The three of us could not challenge a  
line 21608=>hundred,  so we went ahead and spoke  with feigned  voices, leading  them on 
line 21609=>into the wood. 
line 21610=>     `Orophin  has  now  gone in haste  back  to our  dwellings  to warn our 
line 21611=>people. None of the Orcs will  ever return out of  Lurien. And there will be 
line 21612=>many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls. Bu t you 
line 21613=>must take the road south as soon as it is fully light.' 
line 21614=>     Day came pale from the East. As the light grew  it filtered through the 
line 21615=>yellow leaves of  the mallorn, and  it  seemed to the hobbits that the early 
line 21616=>sun of a  cool summer's morning was  shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among the 
line 21617=>moving branches. Looking  through an opening on the south side  of the  flet  
line 21618=>Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying  like a  sea of fallow gold 
line 21619=>tossing gently in the breeze. 
line 21620=>     The  morning was  still  young and cold when the Company set out again, 
line 21621=>guided now  by Haldir and his  brother  R®mil. `Farewell,  sweet Nimrodel! ' 
line 21622=>cried Legolas. Frodo looked back and  caught a gleam of white foam among 
line 21623=>the 
line 21624=>grey tree-stems.  `Farewell,' he said. It seemed to him  tha t he would never  
line 21625=>hear again  a running water so beautiful, for  ever blending its innumerable 
line 21626=>notes in an endless changeful music. 
line 21627=>     They went back to the path that  still  went on along the west side  of 
line 21628=>the  Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward. There were the 
line 21629=>prints of orc-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees 
line 21630=>and halted on the bank of the river under their shadows. 
line 21631=>     `There is one of my  people yonder across the stream,' he said  `though 
line 21632=>
line 21633=>####-you may not see him.' He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out 
line 21634=>of a thicket of  young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood 
line 21635=>thrown back; his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully 
line 21636=>cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end 
line 21637=>about a tree near the bank. 
line 21638=>     `Celebrant is  already  a  strong stream here, as you see,' said Haldir 
line 21639=>'and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it 
line 21640=>so far  north, unless  we must. But  in these days of watchfulness we do not 
line 21641=>make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!' He  made his end of the rope 
line 21642=>fast about another tree,  and then ran lightly along it, over the  river and 
line 21643=>back again, as if he were on a road. 
line 21644=>     `I  can walk  this path,' said  Legolas; `but the others have not  this 
line 21645=>skill. Must they swim?' 
line 21646=>     `No!' said Haldir. `We have two  more ropes. We  will fasten them above 
line 21647=>the other, one shoulder-high,  and another half-high, and holding these  the 
line 21648=>strangers should be able to cross with care.' 
line 21649=>     When this  slender bridge had been made, the Company passed  over, some 
line 21650=>cautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of  the hobbits Pippin proved the 
line 21651=>best for he was  sure-footed, and he walked  over quickly, holding only with 
line 21652=>one hand;  but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. Sam 
line 21653=>shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water 
line 21654=>as if it was a chasm in the mountains.  
line 21655=>     He breathed with relief when he was safely across. `Live and  learn! as 
line 21656=>my gaffer used to say. Though he was thinking of gardening,  not of roosting 
line 21657=>like a bird,  nor  of trying  to walk like a spider. Not even my  uncle Andy 
line 21658=>ever did a trick like that! ' 
line 21659=>     When  at length  all the Company was gathered on the  east  bank of the 
line 21660=>Silverlode,  the Elves untied the ropes and  coiled two of them.  R®mil, who 
line 21661=>had remained  on  the  other side, drew back the last  one, slung  it on his 
line 21662=>shoulder, and  with a wave of his hand went away,  back to  Nimrodel to keep 
line 21663=>watch. 
line 21664=>     `Now, friends,'  said  Haldir, `you have entered the Naith of Lurien or  
line 21665=>the  Gore, as you would  say, for it is the land that lies like a spear -head 
line 21666=>between the arms of Silverlode  and Anduin the Great. We  allow no strangers 
line 21667=>to spy  out the secrets of the  Naith. Few indeed  are permitted even to set 
line 21668=>foot there. 
line 21669=>     `As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf. The 
line 21670=>
line 21671=>####-other may walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down 
line 21672=>in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters. ' 
line 21673=>     This was not at  all to the liking of  Gimli.  `The  agreement was made 
line 21674=>without my consent,' he said. `I will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a  
line 21675=>prisoner. And I am no spy.  My folk  have never had dealings with any of the 
line 21676=>servants of the Enemy. Neither have we  done harm to the Elves. I am no more 
line 21677=>likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.' 
line 21678=>     'I  do not doubt you,' said Haldir. 'Yet this is our law. I am  not the 
line 21679=>master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I  have done much in letting you  
line 21680=>set foot over Celebrant.' 
line 21681=>     Gimli was  obstinate. He  planted his feet  firmly apart, and laid  his 
line 21682=>hand upon the haft of his axe. 'I will go forward free,' he said, 'or I will 
line 21683=>go back and seek my own land,  where I am known to be true of word, though I 
line 21684=>perish alone in the wilderness.' 
line 21685=>     `You cannot go back,' said Haldir sternly. 'Now you have come thus far, 
line 21686=>you must be  brought before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge  you, to 
line 21687=>hold  you or to  give you leave, as they  will. You cannot cross the  rivers 
line 21688=>again, and behind you  there are now secret sentinels  that you cannot pass.  
line 21689=>You would be slain before you saw them.' 
line 21690=>     Gimli  drew  his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their 
line 21691=>bows. 'A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks! ' said Legolas.  
line 21692=>     'Come!'  said Aragorn. `If I am still to lead this Company, you must do 
line 21693=>as I bid. It is hard upon  the Dwarf to be thus singled  out. We will all be 
line 21694=>blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it will make  the journey 
line 21695=>slow and dull.' 
line 21696=>     Gimli laughed  suddenly. `A  merry  troop of fools we  shall look! Will 
line 21697=>Haldir lead us all on a string, like  many blind beggars with one dog? But I 
line 21698=>will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.' 
line 21699=>     `I am an Elf and a  kinsman here,' said Legolas, becoming angry  in his 
line 21700=>turn. 
line 21701=>     `Now let us cry: "a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!"' said Aragorn. 
line 21702=>`But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes Haldir! ' 
line 21703=>     `I shall claim  full amends for every fall and  stubbed  toe, if you do 
line 21704=>not lead us well,' said Gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes.  
line 21705=>     'You will have no claim,' said  Haldir. `I shall lead you well, and the 
line 21706=>paths are smooth and straight.' 
line 21707=>     `Alas for  the  folly  of these  days! '  said Legolas.  'Here  all  are 
line 21708=>
line 21709=>####-enemies of the one Enemy, and yet I must  walk blind, while the sun is merry 
line 21710=>in the woodland under leaves of gold!  ' 
line 21711=>     `Folly it  may seem,' said Haldir. 'Indeed  in nothing is the power  of 
line 21712=>the Dark Lord more clearly shown  than in the estrangement that  divides all  
line 21713=>those who still oppose him.  Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in 
line 21714=>the world beyond Lothlurien, unless maybe in  Rivendell, that we dare not by 
line 21715=>our own  trust  endanger our  land. We live  now  upon  an island  amid many 
line 21716=>perils, and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp.  
line 21717=>     `The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more for the 
line 21718=>Shadow has crept northward  all about  us. Some speak of departing, yet  for  
line 21719=>that it already seems too  late. The mountains to the west are growing evil; 
line 21720=>to the east the lands are waste, and full of Sauron's creatures; and  it  is 
line 21721=>rumoured  that we cannot  now safely pass southward  through  Rohan, and the 
line 21722=>mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come 
line 21723=>to 
line 21724=>the shores of the Sea, we  should  find no  longer any shelter there. It  is 
line 21725=>said that there are still havens of. the High Elves, but they are  far north 
line 21726=>and west, beyond the land of  the Halflings.  But where  that may be, though 
line 21727=>the Lord and Lady may know, I do not.' 
line 21728=>     `You ought  at  least to guess,  since you have seen  us,' said  Merry. 
line 21729=>`There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire where Hobbits live.' 
line 21730=>     `Happy folk  are  Hobbits to dwell  near  the shores of the sea! ' said 
line 21731=>Haldir. 'It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still 
line 21732=>we remember it in song. Tell me of these havens as we walk.' 
line 21733=>     `I cannot,' said Merry. `I have never seen them.  I have never been out 
line 21734=>of my own la nd before. And if I had known what the world outside was like. I 
line 21735=>don't think I should have had the heart to leave it.' 
line 21736=>     `Not even to see fair Lothlurien? '  said Haldir.  'The world is indeed 
line 21737=>full of peril, and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much 
line 21738=>that is fair, and  though in all lands love is  now  mingled with  grief, it 
line 21739=>grows perhaps the greater. 
line 21740=>     `Some there are among us  who sing that  the Shadow  will draw back and 
line 21741=>peace shall come again.  Yet I do not believe  that  the world about us will 
line 21742=>ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime. 
line 21743=>For the Elves, I fear, it will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass 
line 21744=>to  the  Sea  unhindered  and  leave the Middle-earth  for  ever.  Alas  for  
line 21745=>Lothlurien that I  love! It would be a  poor life in a land where no mallorn 
line 21746=>
line 21747=>####-grew.  But  if  there  are  mallorn-trees beyond  the Great Sea,  none  have 
line 21748=>reported it.' 
line 21749=>     As they spoke  thus, the  Company filed slowly along the  paths  in the 
line 21750=>wood, led by Hald ir, while the other Elf walked behind. They felt the ground 
line 21751=>beneath their  feet smooth and  soft, and  after  a while they  walked  more 
line 21752=>freely, without fear of hurt or  fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo  found 
line 21753=>his hearing and  other senses  sharpened. He could smell the  trees and  the 
line 21754=>trodden  grass.  He could hear many  different notes in  the  rustle  of the 
line 21755=>leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on  his right, and  the thin clear 
line 21756=>voices of birds in  the sky. He  felt the sun upon his face  and hands  when 
line 21757=>they passed through an open glade. 
line 21758=>     As  soon  as he  set  foot  upon the  far  bank of Silverlode a strange 
line 21759=>feeling had come upon  him, and it  deepened as he walked on into the Naith: 
line 21760=>it seemed to him that  he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of 
line 21761=>the  Elder Days, and  was  -now walking  in  a world that  was  no  more.  In 
line 21762=>Rivendell  there was memory of  ancient things; in Lurien the ancient things 
line 21763=>still lived on  in the waking world. Evil had been  seen  and  heard  there, 
line 21764=>sorrow had been known; the Elves  feared and  distrusted the world  outside: 
line 21765=>wolves  were howling on  the wood's borders: but  on  the land  of Lurien no 
line 21766=>shadow lay. 
line 21767=>     All that day the  Company marched on, until  they felt the cool evening 
line 21768=>come and heard  the early night-wind whispering among many leaves. Then 
line 21769=>they 
line 21770=>rested and slept without fear upon the ground;  for  their guides would  not 
line 21771=>permit  them to unbind their eyes, and they could  not climb. In the morning 
line 21772=>they went  on again,  walking without  hast e. At noon they halted, and Frodo  
line 21773=>was aware that they had  passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard 
line 21774=>the sound of many voices all around him. 
line 21775=>     A marching host of Elves  had  come up silently:  they  were  hastening 
line 21776=>toward the northern borders to guard against any attack from Moria; and they 
line 21777=>brought news,  some of  which Haldir reported. The marauding orcs  had  been 
line 21778=>waylaid and  almost all destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the 
line 21779=>mountains, and were being pursued.  A strange creature also  had  been seen, 
line 21780=>running with bent back and  with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet  
line 21781=>not of beast-shape. It  had eluded  capture, and  they had not  shot it, not 
line 21782=>knowing whether it was good or ill, and  it had vanished down the Silverlode 
line 21783=>southward. 
line 21784=>
line 21785=>####-     `Also,' said Haldir, `they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of 
line 21786=>the Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that 
line 21787=>the  Lady knows who and what is each member of  your  Company.  New 
line 21788=>messages 
line 21789=>have come from Rivendell perhaps.' 
line 21790=>     He  removed the  bandage  first from Gimli's eyes.  'Your pardon! '  he 
line 21791=>said, bowing low. `Look on  us now with friendly eyes! Look and be glad, for  
line 21792=>you are the  first  dwarf to behold the  trees of the Naith of  Lurien since 
line 21793=>Durin's Day! ' 
line 21794=>     When  his eyes were in  turn uncovered, Frodo looked up  and caught his 
line 21795=>breath.  They were  standing  in an  open  space. To the  left stood a great 
line 21796=>mound, covered with  a sward of grass as  green as Spring-time in the  Elder  
line 21797=>Days.  Upon it , as a double crown, grew two circles of trees: the  outer had 
line 21798=>bark  of  snowy white,  and  were leafless  but  beautiful in  their shapely 
line 21799=>nakedness;  the inner were mallorn-trees of great height,  still arrayed  in 
line 21800=>pale  gold. High  amid  the branches of a  towering  tree that stood in  the 
line 21801=>centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of  the trees, and all 
line 21802=>about  the  green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden  flowers 
line 21803=>shaped  like  stars.  Among them,  nodding  on  slender  stalks,  were  other  
line 21804=>flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered  as a mist amid the rich hue 
line 21805=>of  the  grass. Over all the sky was blue, and  the sun  of afternoon glowed 
line 21806=>upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees.  
line 21807=>     'Behold! You  are come to Cerin Amroth,' said Haldir. `For this is  the 
line 21808=>heart  of the ancient realm  as it  was long ago, and here is the  mound  of 
line 21809=>Amroth, where in  happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom the 
line 21810=>winter  flowers  in the  unfading grass:  the  yellow  elanor, and the  pale 
line 21811=>niphredil. Here we will stay awhile, and  come  to the city of the Galadhrim 
line 21812=>at dusk.' 
line 21813=>     The  others  cast themselves down  upon the  fragrant grass,  but Frodo 
line 21814=>stood  awhile still lost in wonder.  It seemed  to him that  he  had stepped 
line 21815=>through a high window  that looked on a vanished world. A light was  upon it 
line 21816=>for which his language  had no  name.  All that  he saw was shapely, but the 
line 21817=>shapes  seemed at once clear cut, as  if they had  been first conceived  and 
line 21818=>drawn at the uncovering of  his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for  
line 21819=>ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, 
line 21820=>but  they were  fresh  and poignant,  as if  he  had  at  that  moment first  
line 21821=>
line 21822=>####-perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter  here 
line 21823=>no 
line 21824=>heart  could  mourn for summer  or  for spring.  No  blemish  or sickness or  
line 21825=>deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of 
line 21826=>Lurien there was no stain. 
line 21827=>     He  turned  and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round 
line 21828=>with a  puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as  if he was not sure that 
line 21829=>he was  awake. `It's  sunlight  and bright  day, right enough,'  he said. `I  
line 21830=>thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than 
line 21831=>anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was  inside a song. if you take 
line 21832=>my meaning.' 
line 21833=>     Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both 
line 21834=>thought  and  word.  He  smiled. `You  feel the  power of  the  Lady of  the 
line 21835=>Galadhrim,' he said. `Would it please you  to climb with me up Cerin Amroth?  
line 21836=>' 
line 21837=>     They followed  him  as  he stepped lightly up  the  grass-clad  slopes.  
line 21838=>Though he walked and  breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were 
line 21839=>stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that  he was in 
line 21840=>a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When 
line 21841=>he had gone and passed again into  the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer  
line 21842=>from the Shire would walk there, upon the  grass among  elanor and niphredil 
line 21843=>in fair Lothlurien. 
line 21844=>     They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the  South  Wind 
line 21845=>blew  upon Cerin Amroth and  sighed among the  branches. Frodo  stood still, 
line 21846=>hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, 
line 21847=>and sea -birds crying whose race had perished from the earth. 
line 21848=>     Haldir  had gone on and was  now  climbing to the high  flet. As  Frodo 
line 21849=>prepared to follow him,  he laid his hand  upon the  tree beside the ladder: 
line 21850=>never before had  he been  so  suddenly and so keenly aware of the  feel and 
line 21851=>texture of a tree's skin and of the life within  it. He  felt  a  delight in 
line 21852=>wood and  the touch of it, neither  as forester nor as carpenter; it was the 
line 21853=>delight of the living tree itself. 
line 21854=>     As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand 
line 21855=>and turned him toward the South. `Look this way first! ' he said. 
line 21856=>     Frodo looked  and saw, still at some  distance, a  hill of many  mighty 
line 21857=>trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it, 
line 21858=>it seemed  to him that the  power and light came that held all the  land  in 
line 21859=>
line 21860=>####-sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the  green city. Then  
line 21861=>he looked  eastward and  saw all the land of Lurien running down to  the pale  
line 21862=>gleam of Anduin, the Great  River.  He lifted his  eyes across the river and 
line 21863=>all the light went out, and he  was back again in the world he knew.  Beyond 
line 21864=>the river  the land  appeared flat and empty,  formless and vague, until far 
line 21865=>away  it  rose  again  like  a  wall, dark  and drear.  The sun that lay  on 
line 21866=>Lothlurien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height. 
line 21867=>     `There  lies  the fastness of  Southern  Mirkwood,' said Haldir. `It is 
line 21868=>clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and 
line 21869=>their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a  stony height  stands Dol 
line 21870=>Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is 
line 21871=>inhabited again,  and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it 
line 21872=>of  late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one  
line 21873=>to another;  and ever  they  strive now  in thought,  but whereas the  light 
line 21874=>perceives  the very  heart of  the darkness,  its  own  secret has not  been 
line 21875=>discovered. Not yet.' He turned and climbed swiftly down, and  they followed 
line 21876=>him. 
line 21877=>     At the hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still  and silent as a  
line 21878=>tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in 
line 21879=>his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked  at him he 
line 21880=>knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the 
line 21881=>grim years were removed from the  face of Aragorn, and he  seemed clothed in 
line 21882=>white, a  young lord  tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue 
line 21883=>to one whom Frodo could not see . Arwen vanimelda, nambril! he said, and then 
line 21884=>he drew a breath, and returning  out  of his thought  he looked at Frodo and 
line 21885=>smiled. 
line 21886=>     `Here  is the  heart of Elvendom on earth,' he said, `and here my heart 
line 21887=>dwells  ever,  unless there  be a light beyond the dark roads that  we still 
line 21888=>must tread, you and I. Come with  me!  ' And taking Frodo's hand in  his, he 
line 21889=>left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man. 
line 21890=> 
line 21891=>
line 21892=>####- 
line 21893=>
line 21894=>Chapter 7. The Mirror of Galadriel 
line 21895=>
line 21896=> 
line 21897=> 
line 21898=>     The  sun  was  sinking  behind  the  mountains,  and the  shadows  were 
line 21899=>deepening in the woods, when  they went on again.  Their paths now went into 
line 21900=>thickets  where  the dusk had already gathered. Night came beneath the trees 
line 21901=>as they walked, and the Elves uncovered their silver lamps.  
line 21902=>     Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a 
line 21903=>pale evening sky pricked by a  few early  stars.  There  was a wide treeless 
line 21904=>space  before  them, running in a  great circle  and bending  away on  either  
line 21905=>hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its 
line 21906=>brink was green, as if it  glowed still in memory of the sun that  had gone. 
line 21907=>Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a  
line 21908=>green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen  in 
line 21909=>all the land. Their height  could not be  guessed,  but they stood up in the 
line 21910=>twilight like living towers. In  their, many-tiered branches and amid  their 
line 21911=>ever -moving  leaves  countless  lights were  gleaming,  green and  gold  and  
line 21912=>silver. Haldir turned towards the Company. 
line 21913=>     `Welcome to  Caras  Galadhon!  ' he  said. 'Here  is the  city  of  the 
line 21914=>Galadhrim where dwell  the Lord Celeborn  and Galadriel  the Lady of Lurien. 
line 21915=>But we  cannot enter here,  for  the gates do not look northward. We must go  
line 21916=>round to the  southern side,  and the  way is  not  short,  for the city  is 
line 21917=>great.' 
line 21918=>     There was a road  paved with white stone  running on the outer brink of 
line 21919=>the  fosse. Along this  they wen t westward, with the city  ever  climbing up 
line 21920=>like  a  green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened  more lights 
line 21921=>sprang forth, until all the  hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last 
line 21922=>to  a white  bridge, and crossing found  the  great gates of the  city: they 
line 21923=>faced south-west, set between the  ends of the  encircling  wall  that  here 
line 21924=>overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps.  
line 21925=>     Haldir knocked  and  spoke,  and the gates  opened soundlessly; but  of 
line 21926=>guards Frodo could see no sign. The  travellers passed within, and the gates 
line 21927=>shut behind them. They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and 
line 21928=>passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could 
line 21929=>they  see, nor  hear  any feet upon the paths;  but  there were many voices,  
line 21930=>about them, and  in the air  above. Far away up  on the hill they could hear 
line 21931=>
line 21932=>####-the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves.  
line 21933=>     They went along many paths and climbed many  stairs, until they came to 
line 21934=>the high places and saw before them amid a wide  lawn a fountain shimmering. 
line 21935=>It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees,  and it fell 
line 21936=>into a  basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled.  Upon the  south 
line 21937=>side of the lawn  there stood the mightiest  of  all  the trees;  its  great 
line 21938=>smooth  bole  gleamed  like  grey  silk, and up it  towered, until its first 
line 21939=>branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves.  
line 21940=>Beside it  a  broad white ladder stood, and   at  its foot three  Elves  were 
line 21941=>seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they 
line 21942=>were tall and  clad in grey  mail, and from their shoulders hung long  white 
line 21943=>cloaks. 
line 21944=>     'Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,'  said Haldir.  `It is  their  wish 
line 21945=>that you should ascend and speak with them.' 
line 21946=>     One of the  Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and  it 
line 21947=>was answered  three times from far  above. `I will  go first,' said  Haldir. 
line 21948=>'Let Frodo come  next and  with him  Legolas. The others may follow  as they 
line 21949=>wish. It is a  long climb for those that are not  accustomed to such stairs,  
line 21950=>but you may rest upon the way.' 
line 21951=>     As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some 
line 21952=>on  another,  and some set about  the  bole of the tree,  so that the ladder  
line 21953=>passed through them. At a  great height above the ground he came to  a  wide 
line 21954=>talan, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large that 
line 21955=>almost  it would have served  for  a hall of Men upon the earth. He  entered 
line 21956=>behind  Haldir, and found that he was  in a chamber of oval  shape,  in  the 
line 21957=>midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its 
line 21958=>crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth. 
line 21959=>     The chamber was  filled with a  soft  light; its walls were  green  and 
line 21960=>silver and  its roof  of gold. Many Elves were  seated there.  On two chairs 
line 21961=>beneath the  bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side 
line 21962=>by side, Celeborn and Galadriel.  They stood up to greet  their guests, after  
line 21963=>the  manner  of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall 
line 21964=>they were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave  and 
line 21965=>beautiful.  They were clad wholly  in white; and the hair of the Lady was of 
line 21966=>deep gold, and the hair of the  Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright; 
line 21967=>but no sign  of  age was upon  them, unless it were  in  the depths of their 
line 21968=>eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet  profound, the 
line 21969=>
line 21970=>####-wells of deep memory. 
line 21971=>     Haldir led  Frodo  before them, and the  Lord welcomed  him in his  own 
line 21972=>tongue. The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long upon his face. 
line 21973=>     `Sit  now beside  my chair, Frodo of the Shire!  ' said Celeborn. `When 
line 21974=>all have come we will speak together.' 
line 21975=>     Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name  as they entered.  
line 21976=>`Welcome Aragorn son  of Arathorn! ' he said. `It is eight  and thirty years 
line 21977=>of the world outside since you came to this land;  and those years lie heavy 
line 21978=>on you. But the end is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for  
line 21979=>a while! ' 
line 21980=>     'Welcome son of Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from 
line 21981=>the North.' 
line 21982=>     `Welcome Gimli  son of  Gluin!  It is long indeed since  we  saw one of 
line 21983=>Durin's folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken our  long  law. May 
line 21984=>it be a sign that though  the world is now dark better days are at hand, and 
line 21985=>that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.' Gimli bowed low. 
line 21986=>     When all  the guests were seated before his chair   the  Lord  looked at 
line 21987=>them again. 'Here there  are eight,' he said. `Nine were to set out: so said 
line 21988=>the messages. But maybe  there has been some  change of counsel that we have 
line 21989=>not heard. Elrond is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all this 
line 21990=>year the shadows have grown longer.' 
line 21991=>     `Nay, there was no change of counsel,' said the Lady Galadriel speaking 
line 21992=>for the first time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's 
line 21993=>wont. `Gandalf the Grey  set out  with the Company, but he did  not pass the 
line 21994=>borders of this land.  Now tell us where he is; for  I much desired to speak 
line 21995=>with him again. But  I cannot see him from afar,  unless he comes within the 
line 21996=>fences of Lothlurien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and 
line 21997=>of his mind are hidden from me.' 
line 21998=>     'Alas! ' said Aragorn. `Gandalf the Grey fell into  shadow. He remained 
line 21999=>in Moria and did not escape.' 
line 22000=>     At these words  all the  Elves in the  hall  cried aloud  in grief  and 
line 22001=>amazement. `These are evil tidings,' said Celeborn, `the most evil that have 
line 22002=>been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.' He turned to Haldir. 
line 22003=>`Why  has nothing  of  this  been  told  to me before?  '  he  asked in  the 
line 22004=>Elven-tongue. 
line 22005=>     'We  have  not spoken  to  Haldir of  our  deeds or our purpose,'  said 
line 22006=>Legolas. `At  first  we were  weary and  danger  was  too close  behind  and 
line 22007=>
line 22008=>####-afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time,  as  we walked in gladness 
line 22009=>on the fair paths of Lurien.' 
line 22010=>     `Yet our grief  is  great  and our loss  cannot be mended ,' said Frodo. 
line 22011=>'Gandalf was our guide, and he led us  through  Moria; and when  our  escape 
line 22012=>seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.' 
line 22013=>     'Tell us now the full tale! ' said Celeborn: 
line 22014=>     Then  Aragorn  recounted  all  that  had  happened  upon  the  pass  of 
line 22015=>Caradhras, and in  the  days that followed;  and  he spoke  of Balin and his 
line 22016=>book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow 
line 22017=>bridge, and  the  coming of the Terror.  'An  evil  of  the Ancient World it 
line 22018=>seemed,  such as  I have  never seen before,' said  Aragorn. `It  was both a  
line 22019=>shadow and a flame, strong and terrible.' 
line 22020=>     'It was a Balrog of Morgoth,' said Legolas; `of  all elf-banes the most  
line 22021=>deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.' 
line 22022=>     `Indeed I saw  upon  the bridge that  which haunts our darkest dreams l 
line 22023=>saw Durin's Bane,' said Gimli in a low voice, and dread was in his eyes. 
line 22024=>     'Alas!  ' said Celeborn.  `We long have feared that  under Caradhras  a  
line 22025=>terror slept.  But had  I known that the Dwarves had st irred up this evil in 
line 22026=>Moria again,  l  would have forbidden you to pass the  northern borders, you  
line 22027=>and all that went with you. And  if it were possible, one would  say that at 
line 22028=>the last  Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net 
line 22029=>of Moria.' 
line 22030=>     `He would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said Galadriel gravely. 
line 22031=>`Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him 
line 22032=>knew not  his mind and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be 
line 22033=>with the  guide, the followers are blameless.  Do not repent of your welcome  
line 22034=>to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long  and far from Lothlurien, who 
line 22035=>of the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not 
line 22036=>wish 
line 22037=>to look upon their ancient home, though it  had become an abode of dragons?  
line 22038=>     'Dark  is  the  water  of  Kheled-zvram, and cold  are the  springs  of 
line 22039=>Kibil-nvla,  and  fair were  the many-pillared halls  of Khazad-dym in Elder  
line 22040=>Days before  the fall of mighty  kings beneath  the stone.' She looked  upon 
line 22041=>Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the 
line 22042=>names given in his own ancient tongue,  looked up and met her  eyes;  and it 
line 22043=>seemed  to him that he looked  suddenly  into the heart of  an enemy and saw 
line 22044=>there love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then  he smiled 
line 22045=>
line 22046=>####-in answer. 
line 22047=>     He rose clumsily and bowed  in dwarf-fashion, saying: `Yet more fair is 
line 22048=>the living land of  Lurien, and the Lady Galadriel is above  all the  jewels 
line 22049=>that lie beneath the earth! ' 
line 22050=>     There was  a silence.  At length Celeborn spoke again. `I did  not know 
line 22051=>that your plight was so evil,' he said. `Let Gimli  forget my harsh words: I 
line 22052=>spoke in  the trouble of  my heart. I will do what I  can  to aid you,  each 
line 22053=>according  to his wish and need, but especially  that one of the little folk  
line 22054=>who bears the burden.' 
line 22055=>     'Your quest is known to us,' said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. `But  we 
line 22056=>will not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, 
line 22057=>that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed.  
line 22058=>For  the  Lord of  the  Galadhrim is  accounted the wisest of  the Elves  of 
line 22059=>Middle-earth, and a giver of  gifts beyond  the power of kings. He has dwelt  
line 22060=>in  the  West  since  the days of  dawn, and  I have dwelt  with  him  years 
line 22061=>uncounted;  for  ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin  I  passed over the 
line 22062=>mountains, and together through ages  of  the world we have fought  the long 
line 22063=>defeat. 
line 22064=>     'I it was who first summoned  the White Council. And  if my designs had 
line 22065=>not  gone amiss, it would  have been  governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then 
line 22066=>mayhap things would have  gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I 
line 22067=>will not give you  counsel, saying do this,  or do that. For not in doing or  
line 22068=>contriving, nor  in  choosing between this course and another, can  I avail; 
line 22069=>but  only in knowing what was  and is, and in part also  what shall  be. But 
line 22070=>this I will  say to you: your Quest  stands upon the edge of a knife.  Stray 
line 22071=>but a little and it will fail, to the ruin  of  all. Yet hope remains  while 
line 22072=>all the Company is true.' 
line 22073=>     And  with that word  she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked 
line 22074=>searchingly at  each  of them  in turn. None save  Legolas and Aragorn could 
line 22075=>long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed and hung his head. 
line 22076=>     At  length  the  Lady Galadriel  released them from her  eyes,  and she 
line 22077=>smiled. `Do not let your hearts be troubled,' she said. 'Tonight  you  shall 
line 22078=>sleep in peace.' Then they sighed and felt suddenly weary, as those who have 
line 22079=>been questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken openly.  
line 22080=>     `Go now! ' said Celeborn. `You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even 
line 22081=>if  your Quest did  not concern us  closely, you should  have refuge in this 
line 22082=>City, until you were  healed and refreshed. Now  you shall rest, and we will 
line 22083=>
line 22084=>####-not speak of your further road for a while.' 
line 22085=>     That night the Company slept upon the ground, much  to the satisfaction 
line 22086=>of the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion  among  the trees  near 
line 22087=>the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace 
line 22088=>with fair  elvish voices they left  them.  For a little while the travellers 
line 22089=>talked of their night  before in the tree-tops, and of  their day's journey, 
line 22090=>and of the Lord and  Lady;  for they had not yet the  heart to  look further  
line 22091=>back. 
line 22092=>     `What  did you  blush for, Sam?  ' said  Pippin. `You soon  broke down. 
line 22093=>Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope it was nothing 
line 22094=>worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets.' 
line 22095=>     `I never thought no such thing,' answered Sam, in no mood for jest. 'If 
line 22096=>you  want to know, I felt as if I hadn't  got nothing on,  and I didn't like 
line 22097=>it. She seemed to be looking inside  me and asking me what I would do if she 
line 22098=>gave me the chance of  flying back home to the Shire to a nice  little  hole 
line 22099=>with-with a bit of garden of my own.' 
line 22100=>     `That's funny,' said Merry. 'Almost  exactly what I felt  myself; only, 
line 22101=>only well, I don't think I'II say any more,' he ended lamely. 
line 22102=>     All  of them, it seemed, had fared  alike:  each  had felt that  he was 
line 22103=>offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something 
line 22104=>that he greatly  desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had 
line 22105=>only to  turn  aside from the road and  leave the Quest and  the war against 
line 22106=>Sauron to others.  
line 22107=>     `And it seemed  to me, too,'  said Gimli, `that my choice  would remain 
line 22108=>secret and known only to myself.' 
line 22109=>     'To me it seemed exceedingly strange,' said Boromir. `Maybe it was only 
line 22110=>a test,  and she thought to read our thoughts  for her own good purpose; but 
line 22111=>almost I  should  have said that she was tempting us, and offering  what she 
line 22112=>pretended to have the power to give. It  need not be  said that I refused to 
line 22113=>listen. The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word.' But what he thought 
line 22114=>that the Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell. 
line 22115=>     And as for Frodo, he would  not speak, though  Boromir pressed him with 
line 22116=>questions. `She held you long in her gaze, Ring-bearer,' he said. 
line 22117=>     `Yes,'  said Frodo; `but whatever  came into my  mind  then I will keep 
line 22118=>there.' 
line 22119=>     `Well, have a care!  ' said  Boromir.  `I do not feel too sure  of this 
line 22120=>Elvish Lady and her purposes.' 
line 22121=>
line 22122=>####-     `Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel! ' said Aragorn sternly. 'You know 
line 22123=>not what you say.  There is in her  and in  this land no evil, unless a  man 
line 22124=>bring  it  hither himself.  Then let him beware!  But  tonight I shall sleep 
line 22125=>without  fear  for the first time  since  I left Rivendell. And may  I sleep 
line 22126=>deep, and forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in  heart.' He 
line 22127=>cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep. 
line 22128=>     The others soon did the same, and no sound  or  dream  disturbed  their 
line 22129=>slumber. When they woke they found that the light of day  was broad upon the 
line 22130=>lawn before the pavilion.  and  the fountain rose and fell glittering in the 
line 22131=>sun. 
line 22132=>     They remained some  days in Lothlurien, so  far as they could  tell  or 
line 22133=>remember. All the while that they dwelt there the sun  shone clear, save for  
line 22134=>a gentle  rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all  things fresh 
line 22135=>and clean. The air was cool and  soft, as if it were  early spring, yet they 
line 22136=>felt about them the deep  and thoughtful quiet of winter.  It seemed to them 
line 22137=>that they did little but  eat and drink and  rest, and walk among the trees;  
line 22138=>and it was enough. 
line 22139=>     They had not seen  the Lord and Lady  again, and they had little speech 
line 22140=>with the Elven-folk; for few of these  knew or would use the Westron tongue. 
line 22141=>Haldir  had  bidden them  farewell and gone back again to the  fences of the 
line 22142=>North, where great watch was  now kept since the tidings of Moria  that  the 
line 22143=>Company had  brought. Legolas  was away much among the Galadhrim,  and 
line 22144=>after 
line 22145=>the  first  night  he  did not sleep with  the  other companions,  though he 
line 22146=>returned  to  eat and talk with them. Often he  took Gimli with him  when he 
line 22147=>went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change. 
line 22148=>     Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and 
line 22149=>all  that  each had  known and seen of  him came clear before their minds. As 
line 22150=>they  were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew 
line 22151=>more keen. Often they heard nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they 
line 22152=>were making songs  of  lamentation  for his fall,  for they caught  his name 
line 22153=>among the sweet sad words that they could not understand. 
line 22154=>     Mithrandir, Mithrandir  sang  the Elves, O Pilgrim Grey!  For  so  they 
line 22155=>loved  to  call  him.  But if Legolas was with  the  Company,  he would  not 
line 22156=>interpret the songs for them, saying that he had not the skill, and that for  
line 22157=>him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song. 
line 22158=>     It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into  halting words.  
line 22159=>
line 22160=>####-He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in Rivendell he had 
line 22161=>listened 
line 22162=>and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that 
line 22163=>others had made before him. But now as he sat beside the  fountain in Lurien 
line 22164=>and heard  about  him the  voices of the Elves, his thought took shape  in a  
line 22165=>song that seemed fair to him;  yet  when he  tried to repeat it to Sam  only 
line 22166=>snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered leaves. 
line 22167=>     When evening in the Shire was grey 
line 22168=>     his footsteps on the Hill were heard; 
line 22169=>     before the dawn he went away 
line 22170=>     on journey long without a word. 
line 22171=> 
line 22172=>     From Wilderland to Western shore, 
line 22173=>     from northern waste to southern hill, 
line 22174=>     through dragon-lair and hidden door 
line 22175=>     and darkling woods he walked at will. 
line 22176=> 
line 22177=>     With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men, 
line 22178=>     with mortal and immortal folk, 
line 22179=>     with bird on bough and beast in den, 
line 22180=>     in their own secret tongues he spoke. 
line 22181=> 
line 22182=>     A deadly sword, a healing hand, 
line 22183=>     a back that bent beneath its load; 
line 22184=>     a trumpet-voice, a burning brand, 
line 22185=>     a weary pilgrim on the road. 
line 22186=> 
line 22187=>     A lord of wisdom throned he sat, 
line 22188=>     swift in anger, quick to laugh; 
line 22189=>     an old man in a battered hat 
line 22190=>     who leaned upon a thorny staff. 
line 22191=> 
line 22192=>     He stood upon the bridge alone 
line 22193=>     and Fire and Shadow both defied; 
line 22194=>     his staff was broken on the stone, 
line 22195=>     in Khazad-dym his wisdom died. 
line 22196=>     `Why, you'll be beating Mr. Bilbo next! ' said Sam. 
line 22197=>
line 22198=>####-     'No, I am afraid not,' said Frodo. 'But that is the best I can do yet.' 
line 22199=>     'Well, Mr. Frodo, if  you  do have another go, I hope you'll say a word 
line 22200=>about his fireworks,' said Sam. `Something like this:  
line 22201=>     The finest rockets ever seen: 
line 22202=>     they burst in stars of blue and green, 
line 22203=>     or after thunder golden showers 
line 22204=>     came falling like a rain of flowers. 
line 22205=>     Though that doesn't do them justice by a long road.' 
line 22206=>     `No,  I'll  leave that  to  you,  Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But-well. I 
line 22207=>can't talk of  it any more. I can't bear to think  of bringing  the news  to 
line 22208=>him.' 
line 22209=>     One  evening Frodo and Sam were walking  together in the cool twilight.  
line 22210=>Both of them  felt restless again. On  Frodo suddenly the  shadow of parting  
line 22211=>had fallen: he  knew somehow that the time was very near when  he must leave 
line 22212=>Lothlurien. 
line 22213=>     `What do you think of Elves now, Sam?  ' he said. `I asked you the same 
line 22214=>question once before-it   seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more 
line 22215=>of them since then.' 
line 22216=>     'I  have  indeed!  ' said Sam. 'And I reckon  there's  Elves and Elves.  
line 22217=>They're  all  elvish enough,  but they're not all the same. Now  these  folk  
line 22218=>aren't wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they 
line 22219=>seem to belong here, more even than Hobbits do in the Shire. Whether they've 
line 22220=>made the land, or  the  land's  made them, it's hard to say,  if you take my 
line 22221=>meaning. It's  wonderfully  quiet here.  Nothing seems to  be going on,  and 
line 22222=>nobody  seems to  want it to. If  there's any magic  about,  it's right down 
line 22223=>deep, where I can't lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.' 
line 22224=>     'You can see and feel it everywhere,' said Frodo. 
line 22225=>     'Well,' said Sam, 'you can't  see nobody working  it. No  fireworks like 
line 22226=>poor Gandalf used to  show. I  wonder  we  don't see nothing of the Lord and 
line 22227=>Lady in all these days. I fancy now that she could do some wonderful things, 
line 22228=>if she had a mind. I'd dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo!  ' 
line 22229=>     'I  wouldn't,' said Frodo.  `I am content.  And I don't  miss Gandalf's 
line 22230=>fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.' 
line 22231=>     `You're right,'  said  Sam.  `And don't think I'm  finding  fault. I've 
line 22232=>often wanted to  see a  bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but 
line 22233=>I've never heard of a  better land than this. It's like being at home and on 
line 22234=>a holiday at the same time, if you understand me. I don't want to leave. All 
line 22235=>
line 22236=>####-the same,  I'm beginning to feel that if we've got to go on,  then we'd best 
line 22237=>get it over. 
line 22238=>     'It's the  job that's never started as takes longest  to finish, as  my 
line 22239=>old gaffer used to say. And I don't reckon that these folk  can do much more 
line 22240=>to  help us, magic or no. It's  when we leave  this land that we shall  miss 
line 22241=>Gandalf worse, I'm thinking.' 
line 22242=>     'I  am afraid that's only too  true, Sam,' said Frodo. `Yet I hope very 
line 22243=>much that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the Elves again.' 
line 22244=>     Even as he spoke, they saw,  as if she  came in answer to their  words,  
line 22245=>the  Lady Galadriel  approaching. Tall and white and fair she walked beneath 
line 22246=>the trees. She spoke no word, but beckoned to them. 
line 22247=>     Turning aside, she led them  toward  the southern slopes of the hill of 
line 22248=>Caras Galadhon,  and passing through  a high green  hedge they  came into an 
line 22249=>enclosed  garden. No trees  grew there,  and it  lay open  to the  sky.  The 
line 22250=>evening star had risen and  was  shining with white  fire above  the western 
line 22251=>woods.  Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into   a deep green hollow, 
line 22252=>through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the  fountain 
line 22253=>on  the hill.  At the bottom, upon a  low  pedestal  carved like a branching 
line 22254=>tree, stood a basin  of silver.  wide  and shallow, and beside  it  stood  a  
line 22255=>si lver ewer. 
line 22256=>     With water from the stream Galadriel  filled the basin to the brim, and 
line 22257=>breathed  on it, and when the water  was still again she spoke. `Here is the 
line 22258=>Mirror  of Galadriel,'  she said.  'I have  brought you here so that you may 
line 22259=>look in it, if you will.' 
line 22260=>     The air was very still, and the dell  was dark, and the Elf-lady beside 
line 22261=>him was tall and pale. 'What shall we  look  for,  and what shall we  see? ' 
line 22262=>asked Frodo, filled with awe. 
line 22263=>     `Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,' she a nswered, `and to  
line 22264=>some I can  show  what  they desire  to see. But the  Mirror will  also show 
line 22265=>things unbidden,  and those  are  often stranger  and more  profitable  than 
line 22266=>things which we  wish  to behold. What you will see, if you leave the Mirror  
line 22267=>free to work, I cannot tell.  For it shows things that were, and things that 
line 22268=>are,  things  that yet may be. But which it is that he sees, even the wisest  
line 22269=>cannot always tell. Do you wish to look? ' 
line 22270=>     Frodo did not answer. 
line 22271=>     `And you? ' she said, turning to Sam.  'For this is what your folk would 
line 22272=>call magic. I  believe;  though I  do not understand clearly what they mean; 
line 22273=>
line 22274=>####-and  they seem also to use  the  same word of the  deceits of the Enemy. But 
line 22275=>this, if you will, is  the  magic of Galadriel. Did  you not  say  that  you  
line 22276=>wished to see Elf-magic?  ' 
line 22277=>     'I did,' said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity. `I'll 
line 22278=>have a peep, Lady, if you're willing.' 
line 22279=>     `And I'd not mind  a glimpse of what's going on at home,' he said in an 
line 22280=>aside to  Frodo.  'It seems a terrible  long time that  I've been  away. But 
line 22281=>there, like  as  not I'll only  see the  stars,  or something that  I  won't  
line 22282=>understand.' 
line 22283=>     'Like as not,' said the Lady with a gentle laugh. `But come,  you shall 
line 22284=>look and see what you may. Do not touch the water! ' 
line 22285=>     Sam climbed up  on  the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. 
line 22286=>The water looked hard and dark. Stars were reflected in it. 
line 22287=>     `There's only stars, as I thought,'  he said. Then he gave a  low gasp, 
line 22288=>for  the stars went out. As if  a dark  veil had  been withdrawn, the Mirror  
line 22289=>grew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the branches  of trees 
line 22290=>were waving and tossing in the  wind. But before Sam could make  up his mind 
line 22291=>what it  was that he saw, the  light faded; and  now he thought he saw Frodo 
line 22292=>with  a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed 
line 22293=>to see  himself going along  a dim passage, and climbing an endless  winding 
line 22294=>stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently  for  something, 
line 22295=>but what it was he  did not know. Like a dream the vision  shifted and  went  
line 22296=>back, and he  saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and  
line 22297=>he could see what was  going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were 
line 22298=>falling, crashing to the ground. 
line 22299=>     `Hi!' cried Sam  in  an  outraged  voice.  'There's  that Ted  Sandyman 
line 22300=>a-cutting down trees as he  shouldn't. They didn't ought to be  felled: it's 
line 22301=>that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater. I  wish I could  
line 22302=>get at Ted, and I'd fell him ! ' 
line 22303=>     But  now  Sam  noticed  that the Old  Mill had  vanished,  and  a large 
line 22304=>red-brick building was being put up  where it had stood. Lots of  folk  were 
line 22305=>busily  at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby.  Black smoke seemed to 
line 22306=>cloud the surface of the Mirror. 
line 22307=>     'There's some devilry at work in the Shire,' he said. 'Elrond knew what 
line 22308=>he  was about when he wanted to send Mr. Merry back.' Then suddenly Sam 
line 22309=>gave 
line 22310=>a cry and sprang away. 'I can't stay here,' he said wildly. `I must go home. 
line 22311=>
line 22312=>####-They've dug up Bagshot Row, and there's the  poor old gaffer  going down the 
line 22313=>Hill with his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home! ' 
line 22314=>     'You cannot go home alone,' said the Lady. 'You did not wish to go home 
line 22315=>without your master before you looked in the Mirror, and  yet  you knew that 
line 22316=>evil things might well be happening in the  Shire.  Remember that the Mirror 
line 22317=>shows many things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be, 
line 22318=>unless those that behold the visions turn aside  from their path to  prevent 
line 22319=>them. The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.' 
line 22320=>     Sam  sat on  the  ground and  put his head in his hands. `I  wish I had 
line 22321=>never come  here, and I don't want to see  no  more magic,' he said and fell 
line 22322=>silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with  tears. 
line 22323=>`No, I'll go home by the long road with Mr. Frodo, or  not at all,' he said. 
line 22324=>`But I hope I  do  get  back some  day. If  what  I've  seen turns out true, 
line 22325=>somebody's going to catch it hot! ' 
line 22326=>     `Do you now  wish to look , Frodo? '  said  the Lady Galadriel. `You did 
line 22327=>not wish to see Elf-magic and were content.' 
line 22328=>     `Do you advise me to look? ' asked Frodo. 
line 22329=>     'No,' she said. `I do not counsel you one way or the other. I am  not a  
line 22330=>counsellor.  You may  learn something, a nd  whether what you  see be fair or 
line 22331=>evil, that  may be profitable,  and yet it may not. Seeing is both good  and 
line 22332=>perilous. Yet  I think, Frodo, that you have courage and  wisdom enough  for 
line 22333=>the venture, or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will!   ' 
line 22334=>     `I will look,' said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over  
line 22335=>the  dark  water.  At once the Mirror  cleared  and  he  saw  a twilit land. 
line 22336=>Mountains  loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A  long grey road 
line 22337=>wound back out of sight.  Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint 
line 22338=>and  small at  first,  but  growing  larger and  clearer  as it  approached. 
line 22339=>Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded  him  of Gandalf. He  almost called 
line 22340=>aloud the wizard's name, and then he saw that  the figure was clothed not in 
line 22341=>grey but in  white, in  a white  that shone faintly in the dusk; and  in its 
line 22342=>hand  there was  a white staff. The  head was so bowed that he could see  no 
line 22343=>face,  and  presently the figure turned aside round  a bend in the road  and 
line 22344=>went out  of  the Mirror's  view. Doubt came into Frodo's  mind:  was this a  
line 22345=>vision of Gandalf on one of his  many  lonely  journeys long  ago, or was it 
line 22346=>Saruman?  
line 22347=>     The vision now  changed. Brief and  small but  very vivid  he  caught a  
line 22348=>glimpse of  Bilbo  walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered 
line 22349=>
line 22350=>####-with disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows. 
line 22351=>     Then there  was a pause, and after  it many swift scenes followed  that 
line 22352=>Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become 
line 22353=>involved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before 
line 22354=>but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose  and raged in a great 
line 22355=>storm. Then  he saw  against  the  Sun, sinking  blood-red into a  wrack  of 
line 22356=>clouds,  the black outline  of a tall ship with torn sails riding up  out of 
line 22357=>the  West.  Then a wide river flowing through a  populous city. Then a white  
line 22358=>fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with  black sails, but now 
line 22359=>it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing  
line 22360=>the  emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke  as of fire and battle 
line 22361=>arose, and again the  sun went  down in a burning red that faded into a grey 
line 22362=>mist; and into the mist a small  ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It 
line 22363=>vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away. 
line 22364=>     But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as  if a hole had 
line 22365=>opened in the world  of sight, and Frodo looked into emptiness. In the black  
line 22366=>abyss there appeared a single Eye  that slowly grew. until it  filled nearly 
line 22367=>all  the  Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to  cry 
line 22368=>out  or  to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but  was itself 
line 22369=>glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful  and  intent, and  the black slit of its 
line 22370=>pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing. 
line 22371=>     Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew 
line 22372=>with certainty  and  horror that  among  the  many things that it sought  he 
line 22373=>himself  was one. But  he also knew that  it could not see him-not yet,  not 
line 22374=>unless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its  chain  about his neck grew 
line 22375=>heavy, heavier than a great stone,  and his  head was dragged downwards. The 
line 22376=>Mirror  seemed  to be growing hot and  curls  of steam were rising  from the 
line 22377=>water. He was slipping forward. 
line 22378=>     `Do not touch the water!' said the  Lady  Galadriel softly. The  vision 
line 22379=>faded,  and Frodo found that he was  looking  at the cool stars twinkling in 
line 22380=>the silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady. 
line 22381=>     `I know what it was that you  last saw,' she said; `for that is also in 
line 22382=>my mind. Do not be  afraid! But do  not think that only by singing  amid the 
line 22383=>trees, nor  even by  the  slender arrows of  elven-bows,  is  this  land  of 
line 22384=>Lothlurien maintained and defended against its  Enemy. I say  to you, Frodo, 
line 22385=>that  even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or  
line 22386=>all of his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my 
line 22387=>
line 22388=>####-thought. But still the door is closed! ' 
line 22389=>     She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East 
line 22390=>in a  gesture of  rejection  and  denial. Edrendil, the Evening  Star,  most  
line 22391=>beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of 
line 22392=>the Elven-lady cast a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring 
line 22393=>about  her  finger; it  glittered like  polished  gold overlaid  with silver 
line 22394=>light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Even -star had come down to 
line 22395=>rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with awe; for suddenly it seemed  
line 22396=>to him that he understood. 
line 22397=>     `Yes,' she said, divining his thought, `it is not permitted to speak of 
line 22398=>it,  and  Elrond  could  not  do  so.  But  it  cannot  be  hidden from  the 
line 22399=>Ring-bearer,  and  one who has seen  the Eye.  Verily it is in the  land  of 
line 22400=>Lurien upon  the finger of Galadriel  that one of the Three remains. This is 
line 22401=>Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper. 
line 22402=>     `He suspects, but  he  does not  know  --  not  yet. Do you not see now 
line 22403=>wherefore your  coming is to us as  the footstep  of  Doom? For if you fail, 
line 22404=>then we are  laid  bare to the Enemy.  Yet if you succeed, then our power is 
line 22405=>diminished, and Lothlurien will fade, and the  tides  of  Time will sweep it 
line 22406=>away. We must depart into the  West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell  and 
line 22407=>cave, slowly to forget and to be forgotten.' 
line 22408=>     Frodo bent his head. `And what do you wish? ' he said at last. 
line 22409=>     `That  what should be shall be,' she answered.  `The love of the  Elves 
line 22410=>for  their land  a nd  their works is deeper than the deeps of  the Sea,  and 
line 22411=>their regret  is  undying and cannot ever  wholly be assuaged. Yet they will 
line 22412=>cast all away rather than submit to Sauron: for they know him  now.  For the 
line 22413=>fate of Lothlurien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own  
line 22414=>task. Yet I  could wish, were it of any avail, that the One  Ring had  never 
line 22415=>been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.' 
line 22416=>     'You are wise  and fearless  and fair, Lady  Galadriel,' said Frodo. `I  
line 22417=>will give  you the One Ring, if you ask for it. It is too great a matter for  
line 22418=>me.' 
line 22419=>     Galadriel laughed  with a sudden clear laugh. `Wise the  Lady Galadriel 
line 22420=>may be,' she said, `yet here she has met her match in  courtesy. Gently  are 
line 22421=>you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to  
line 22422=>see with a keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to  ask  
line 22423=>what you offer. For many long  years I  had pondered what I might do, should 
line 22424=>the  Great  Ring come  into my hands, and behold!  it was brought  within my 
line 22425=>
line 22426=>####-grasp. The evil that was devised long ago  works on  in many  ways,  whether 
line 22427=>Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set  
line 22428=>to the credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest?  
line 22429=>     `And now a t last  it comes. You will give me the Ring  freely! In place  
line 22430=>of  the Dark Lord  you will set up  a  Queen. And I shall  not  be dark, but 
line 22431=>beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the 
line 22432=>Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain! Drea dful as the Storm and the 
line 22433=>Lightning!  
line 22434=>Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair! ' 
line 22435=>     She  lifted up her hand and from the  ring that she wore there issued a  
line 22436=>great  light that  illuminated her  alone  and left all else dark. She stood 
line 22437=>before  Frodo seeming  now  tall beyond  measurement, and  beautiful  beyond 
line 22438=>enduring, terrible and worshipful. Then she let her hand fall, and the light 
line 22439=>faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and  lo! she was  shrunken: a slender  
line 22440=>elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad. 
line 22441=>     'I pass the test,' she said. `I will diminish, and go into the West and 
line 22442=>remain Galadriel.' 
line 22443=>     They stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again. 
line 22444=>`Let us return! ' she  said. `In the morning you must depart for now we have 
line 22445=>chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.' 
line 22446=>     `I  would  ask  one thing before we go,'  said Frodo, `a  thing which I 
line 22447=>often meant to  ask  Gandalf in Rivendell. I  am permitted to  wear  the One 
line 22448=>Ring: why  cannot I see all the others  and know the thoughts  of those that 
line 22449=>wear them? ' 
line 22450=>     `You have not tried,' she said. `Only thrice have you set the Ring upon 
line 22451=>your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do not try!  It would destroy 
line 22452=>you.  Did not Ganda lf tell  you that  the rings give power  according to the 
line 22453=>measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need 
line 22454=>to 
line 22455=>become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet 
line 22456=>even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has borne it on finger and seen that 
line 22457=>which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You  have perceived  my thought 
line 22458=>more clearly than many  that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that 
line 22459=>holds the  Seven and the Nine.  And  did  you not see and recognize the ring 
line 22460=>upon my finger? Did you see my ring? ' she asked turning again to Sam. 
line 22461=>     'No, Lady,' he  answered. `To tell you the truth, I  wondered what  you  
line 22462=>were talking about.  I  saw a star through your finger. But if you'll pardon 
line 22463=>
line 22464=>####-my speaking  out,  I think my master was right. I  wish you'd take his Ring. 
line 22465=>You'd  put things  to  rights.  You'd  stop them digging up the  gaffer  and 
line 22466=>turning him adrift. You'd make some folk pay for their dirty work.' 
line 22467=>     `I would,' she said. `That is how it would begin. Bu t it would not stop 
line 22468=>with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!' 
line 22469=>
line 22470=>####- 
line 22471=> 
line 22472=>
line 22473=>Chapter 8. Farewell to Lurien 
line 22474=>
line 22475=> 
line 22476=> 
line 22477=>     That  night  the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn, 
line 22478=>and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words. At length Celeborn 
line 22479=>spoke of their departure. 
line 22480=>     `Now is the time,' he  said, `when those who wish to continue the Quest  
line 22481=>must harden their hearts to leave this land.  Those who no longer wish to go  
line 22482=>forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, none  can 
line 22483=>be sure of  peace.  For we are come now to  the edge of doom. Here those who 
line 22484=>wish  may await  the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of  the world 
line 22485=>lie open again. or we summon them to the  last need of Lurien. Then they may 
line 22486=>return to their own lands, or else go to the long home of those that fall in 
line 22487=>battle.' 
line 22488=>     There was a silence. `They all resolved to  go forward,' said Galadriel 
line 22489=>looking in their eyes. 
line 22490=>     `As for me,' said Boromir, `my way home lies onward and not back.' 
line 22491=>     `That is true,' said Celeborn, `but is all this Company  going with you  
line 22492=>to Minas Tirith? ' 
line 22493=>     `We have not decided our course,' said Aragorn. 'Beyond Lothlurien I do 
line 22494=>not know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had 
line 22495=>any clear purpose. ' 
line 22496=>     `Maybe not,' said  Celeborn, `yet when you leave this land, you  can no 
line 22497=>longer  forget  the Great  River.  As  some of you  know well, it  cannot be 
line 22498=>crossed  by travellers with baggage between Lurien and Gondor, save by boat. 
line 22499=>And are not the bridges  of Osgiliath broken down  and all the landings held 
line 22500=>now by the Enemy?  
line 22501=>     `On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this 
line 22502=>side, upon  the  west; but the straight road of the Quest  lies east of  the 
line 22503=>River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take?  ' 
line 22504=>     `If my advice  is heeded, it will be the western shore,  and the way to 
line 22505=>Minas Tirith,' answered Boromir.  `But I  am not the leader of the Company.' 
line 22506=>The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled. 
line 22507=>     `I see that you do not yet know  what to do,' said Celeborn. `It is not 
line 22508=>my  part to choose for you; but I will help you as  I  may.  There are  some 
line 22509=>
line 22510=>####-among  you who can handle  boats: Legolas, whose folk know  the swift Forest  
line 22511=>River; and Boromir of Gondor; and Aragorn the traveller.' 
line 22512=>     `And  one Hobbit! ' cried Merry. `Not all of us look on  boats as  wild 
line 22513=>horses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.' 
line 22514=>     `That is  well,' said Celeborn. `Then I will furnish  your Company with 
line 22515=>boats. They must be small and light, for  if you go far  by water, there are 
line 22516=>places where you will be forced to  carry them. You will come to  the rapids 
line 22517=>of Sarn  Gebir,  and maybe at  last to the  great falls of  Rauros where the 
line 22518=>River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there  are other perils. Boats may 
line 22519=>make your journey less toilsome for  a while.  Yet they  will  not  give you  
line 22520=>counsel:  in the  end  you must leave  them and the River, and turn  west -or 
line 22521=>east.' 
line 22522=>     Aragorn  thanked  Celeborn  many times. The gift of boats comforted him 
line 22523=>much, not least because there would now be no  need to decide his course for 
line 22524=>some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils  lay ahead, 
line 22525=>it seemed better to float down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to 
line 22526=>plod   forward  with  bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still 
line 22527=>thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not  all the dangers that 
line 22528=>he had survived made him think better of them. 
line 22529=>     `All shall be prepared for you and await you  at the  haven before noon 
line 22530=>tomorrow,'  said  Celeborn.  'I will send my people to you in the morning to 
line 22531=>help you make ready for the journey. Now we will  wish  you all a fair night  
line 22532=>and untroubled sleep.' 
line 22533=>     'Good  night,  my friends!  ' said Galadriel.  'Sleep in peace! Do  not 
line 22534=>trouble your  hearts overmuch with thought of  the road tonight.  Maybe  the 
line 22535=>paths that  you each  shall tread are  already laid before your feet, though 
line 22536=>you do not see them. Good night! ' 
line 22537=>     The  Company  now  took  their leave  and  returned to their  pavilion. 
line 22538=>Legolas  went with them, for this  was to be their last night in Lothlurien, 
line 22539=>and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together. 
line 22540=>     For a  long time they debated what they should do, and  how it would be 
line 22541=>best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with the Ring: but they came 
line 22542=>to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go  first to Minas 
line 22543=>Tirith, and to  escape at least for a while from  the  terror of  the Enemy. 
line 22544=>They would have been willing to follow a leader  over the River and into the  
line 22545=>shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke  no word, and Aragorn was still divided in 
line 22546=>his mind. 
line 22547=>
line 22548=>####-     His  own  plan, while Gandalf remained with  them, had been to go  with 
line 22549=>Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For he believed that the 
line 22550=>message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last 
line 22551=>when 
line 22552=>the  heir of  Elendil  should  come  forth and  strive with  Sauron  for the 
line 22553=>mastery. But in Moria  the burden of Gandalf had been laid  on  him; and  he  
line 22554=>knew that he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in  the end to  
line 22555=>go with  Boromir. And  yet what help could he or any of the Company give  to 
line 22556=>Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?  
line 22557=>     `I shall go to Minas Tirith,  alone if need be, for it is my duty,' said 
line 22558=>Boromir; and after  that he was  silent  for a while,  sitting with his eyes 
line 22559=>fixed  on Frodo, as if  he was trying  to  read the Halfling's thoughts.  At 
line 22560=>length he spoke  again, softly, as if he was debating  with himself. `If you  
line 22561=>wish only to destroy  the Ring,' he said,  `then there is little use in  war 
line 22562=>and weapons; and the Men of Minas  Tirith  cannot  help.  But if you wish to  
line 22563=>destroy the armed might  of the  Dark Lord,  then it is folly  to go without 
line 22564=>force into his domain; and folly  to throw away.' He  paused suddenly, as if 
line 22565=>he had  become aware that he was  speaking his thoughts aloud. `It  would be 
line 22566=>folly  to  throw  lives away,  I  mean,' he ended. `It is  a choice  between 
line 22567=>defending a  strong place  and   walking openly  into the arms  of death.  At  
line 22568=>least, that is how I see it.' 
line 22569=>     Frodo caught something  new  and strange  in  Boromir's glance, and  he 
line 22570=>looked hard at  him.  Plainly Boromir's thought was different from his final 
line 22571=>words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said 
line 22572=>something like this  at the Council, but then he had accepted the correction 
line 22573=>of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn,  but he seemed  deep in  his own thought 
line 22574=>and made no sign that he  had  heeded Boromir's wor ds.  And so  their debate 
line 22575=>ended. Merry and Pippin were  already asleep, and Sam was nodding. The 
line 22576=>night 
line 22577=>was growing old. 
line 22578=>     In the  morning, as they were  beginning  to  pack their slender goods,  
line 22579=>Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts 
line 22580=>of food and clothing for the  journey.  The food was  mostly in the  form of 
line 22581=>very thin cakes, made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside, 
line 22582=>and inside  was  the colour of  cream. Gimli took  up one  of  the cakes and 
line 22583=>looked at it with a doubtful eye. 
line 22584=>     `Cram,' he said  under his breath,  as he broke off a crisp corner  and 
line 22585=>
line 22586=>####-nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and  he ate  all the rest  of 
line 22587=>the cake with relish. 
line 22588=>     `No more,  no  more!' cried the  Elves laughing.  `You have eaten enough 
line 22589=>already for a long day's march.' 
line 22590=>     `I thought  it was  only a kind of cram, such as  the Dale-men make for 
line 22591=>journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf.  
line 22592=>     `So it is,' they answered.  `But we call it   lembas or waybread, and it 
line 22593=>is mor e strengthening than any food made  by Men, and  it  is more  pleasant  
line 22594=>than cram, by all accounts.' 
line 22595=>     `Indeed it is,' said Gimli.  'Why it is better than  the honey-cakes of 
line 22596=>the Beornings,  and  that  is great praise,  for the Beornings  are the best 
line 22597=>bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes 
line 22598=>to travellers in these days. You are kindly hosts! ' 
line 22599=>     'All the same, we bid you spare the food,' they  said. 'Eat little at a  
line 22600=>time,  and only at need. For these things  are given to  serve  you when all  
line 22601=>else fails.  The  cakes  will keep sweet  for  many many  days, if  they are 
line 22602=>unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. One will 
line 22603=>keep a traveller on his feet for a day of  long labour, even if he be one of 
line 22604=>the tall Men of Minas Tirith.' 
line 22605=>     The  Elves next unwrapped  and gave to each  of the Company the clothes 
line 22606=>they  had  brought.  For  each they  had  provided a  hood  and cloak,  made 
line 22607=>according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim 
line 22608=>wove. It was  hard to say of what  colour they were:  grey with  the hue  of 
line 22609=>twilight under  the trees they seemed  to be; and yet if they were moved, or  
line 22610=>set in another light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow 
line 22611=>fields by  night, dusk -silver  as  water under  the  stars. Each  cloak  was 
line 22612=>fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver. 
line 22613=>     `Are these magic cloaks? ' asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder. 
line 22614=>     `I do  not  know what you mean by  that,' answered  the  leader  of the 
line 22615=>Elves. `They are fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this 
line 22616=>land. They are elvish robes certainly, if that is what  you  mean. Leaf  and  
line 22617=>branch, water and  stone: they have the hue and beauty  of all  these things 
line 22618=>under the twilight of Lurien that we  love; for  we  put the thought of  all 
line 22619=>that we love into all that  we make. Yet they  are garments, not armour, and 
line 22620=>they  will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve you well: they are 
line 22621=>light to wear, and warm enough  or cool enough at  need.  And  you will find 
line 22622=>them a great aid in keeping out of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you  
line 22623=>
line 22624=>####-walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the 
line 22625=>Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have 
line 22626=>we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.' 
line 22627=>     After  their morning meal the Company said farewell to  the lawn by the 
line 22628=>fountain.  Their  hearts  were  heavy;  for it was a fair  place, and it had 
line 22629=>become like home to  them,  though they could not count the days and  nights 
line 22630=>that they had passed there. As they stood for a moment looking at the  white 
line 22631=>water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass 
line 22632=>of the glade. Frodo greeted him with delight. 
line 22633=>     'I have  returned from the  Northern  Fences,'  said the Elf, `and I am 
line 22634=>sent  now  to be your guide again.  The Dimrill Dale is  full of vapour  and 
line 22635=>clouds of  smoke,  and the  mountains are troubled. There are noises in  the 
line 22636=>deeps  of the  earth. If any of you had thought  of returning northwards  to 
line 22637=>your homes, you would not have been able to pass  that  way. But come!  Your 
line 22638=>path now goes south.' 
line 22639=>     As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in 
line 22640=>the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing. They 
line 22641=>themselves 
line 22642=>went  silently. At last Haldir  led them down the  southward  slopes  of the 
line 22643=>hill, and they came again  to  the great  gate hung with  lamps, and to  the 
line 22644=>white  bridge; and so they  passed out and left the city of the Elves.  Then 
line 22645=>they turned  away from the paved road  and took  a path that went off into a  
line 22646=>deep  thicket  of  mallorn-trees,  and passed  on,  winding through  rolling 
line 22647=>woodlands  of  silver  shadow,  leading   them  ever  down,  southwards  and 
line 22648=>eastwards, towards the shores of the River. 
line 22649=>     They had gone  some ten miles and noon  was at hand when they came on a  
line 22650=>high green  wall. Passing through  an opening they came  suddenly out of the 
line 22651=>trees. Before them  lay a  long  lawn of shining grass, studded  with golden 
line 22652=>elanor  that  glinted  in the sun.  The lawn ran  out  into a narrow  tongue 
line 22653=>between  bright margins:  on  the  right  and  west  the  Silverlode  flowed 
line 22654=>glittering; on the left and  east the Great River  rolled its broad  waters, 
line 22655=>deep and  dark.  On  the  further  shores the  woodlands  still  marched  on 
line 22656=>southwards as far as the eye could see, but  all the banks  were  bleak  and 
line 22657=>bare. No mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lurien. 
line 22658=>     On  the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of 
line 22659=>the  streams,  there was a hythe of white stones and  white wood. By it were 
line 22660=>moored many boats and  barges.  Some were  brightly painted, and shone  with 
line 22661=>
line 22662=>####-silver and gold  and green, but most were either  white or grey. Three small 
line 22663=>grey boats had been made ready for  the travellers, and  in  these the Elves 
line 22664=>stowed their goods. And they added  also coils of rope, three  to each boat. 
line 22665=>Slender they looked, but strong,  silken  to the touch, grey of hue like the 
line 22666=>elven-cloaks.  
line 22667=>     `What  are  these?  '  asked  Sam,  handling  one  that  lay  upon  the 
line 22668=>greensward. 
line 22669=>     `Ropes indeed! ' answered an Elf  from the  boats.  'Never  travel  far 
line 22670=>without  a rope! And one that is long and strong and light. Such  are these. 
line 22671=>They may be a help in many needs.' 
line 22672=>     'You don't  need to  tell me  that! ' said Sam. `I came without any and 
line 22673=>I've been worried ever since. But I was wondering  what these  were made of,  
line 22674=>knowing a bit about rope -making: it's in the family as you might say.' 
line 22675=>     `They are made of hithlain ,' said the Elf, `but there is no time now to 
line 22676=>instruct  you  in  the  art of their making. Had we  known that  this  craft  
line 22677=>delighted  you, we  could  have taught  you  much. But  now alas! unless you 
line 22678=>should at some time return hither, you must be content with our gift. May it 
line 22679=>serve you well! ' 
line 22680=>     `Come! ' said Haldir.  `All is now ready  for you. Enter the boats! But 
line 22681=>take care at first! ' 
line 22682=>     'Heed the words! ' said the other  Elves. 'These boats are light-built, 
line 22683=>and they are crafty and  unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink, 
line 22684=>lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be  wise 
line 22685=>if you accustomed yourselves to stepping  in and out,  here where there is a  
line 22686=>landing-place, before you set off downstream.' 
line 22687=>     The Company  was  arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in 
line 22688=>one boat; Boromir,  Merry,  and Pippin  in another; and  in the  third  were 
line 22689=>Legolas and Gimli, who  had now become fast friends. In this last boat  most 
line 22690=>of  the goods and packs were  stowed. The boats were moved and  steered with 
line 22691=>short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all  was ready 
line 22692=>Aragorn led them  on a trial up  the Silverlode. The current  was  swift and 
line 22693=>they went  forward slowly. Sam sat  in the  bows,  clutching the  sides, and 
line 22694=>looking back wistfully to  the  shore. The sunlight  glittering on the water  
line 22695=>dazzled his eyes.  As they passed beyond the green field of the Tongue,  the 
line 22696=>trees  drew down to the  river's  brink. Here and there golden lea ves tossed 
line 22697=>and floated on the  rippling stream.  The air was very bright and still, and 
line 22698=>there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks. 
line 22699=>
line 22700=>####-     They turned a sharp bend in  the river, and there, sailing proudly down 
line 22701=>the stream toward them, they saw a  swan of great size. The water rippled on  
line 22702=>either  side of the white  breast beneath its curving neck. Its  beak  shone 
line 22703=>like burnished gold, and its eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its 
line 22704=>huge white wings  were half lifted.  A music came down the river as it  drew 
line 22705=>nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was  a ship, wrought  and carved 
line 22706=>with elven-skill in the likeness of  a bird. Two elves clad in white steered 
line 22707=>it  with  black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind 
line 22708=>him  stood Galadriel, tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her  
line 22709=>hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and  she sang. Sad and  sweet was the 
line 22710=>sound of her voice in the cool clear air: 
line 22711=>     I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold  there grew:  
line 22712=>     Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.  
line 22713=>     Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea, 
line 22714=>     And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree. 
line 22715=>     Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone, 
line 22716=>     In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion. 
line 22717=>     There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years, 
line 22718=>     While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears. 
line 22719=>     O Lurien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day; 
line 22720=>     The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away. 
line 22721=>     O Lurien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore 
line 22722=>     And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor. 
line 22723=>     But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me, 
line 22724=>     What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea? 
line 22725=>     Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended 
line 22726=>her  song and greeted them. `We have come to bid you our last farewell,' she 
line 22727=>said, `and to speed you with blessings from our land . ' 
line 22728=>     `Though  you have  been our guests,'  said Celeborn, `you have  not yet 
line 22729=>eaten with  us, and we  bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between 
line 22730=>the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lurien.' 
line 22731=>     The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and 
line 22732=>followed it. There in the last  end  of  Egladil  upon  the  green grass the 
line 22733=>parting feast was held;  but Frodo ate  and drank  little,  heeding only the 
line 22734=>beauty of the Lady and her voice. She seemed no longer perilous or terrible,  
line 22735=>nor  filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later 
line 22736=>days Elves still  at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision 
line 22737=>
line 22738=>####-of that  which has already been left far behind by  the  flowing  streams of 
line 22739=>Time. 
line 22740=>     After they had eaten and drunk,  sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke 
line 22741=>to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the 
line 22742=>woods beyond the Tongue. 
line 22743=>     `As you go down the water,' he said, `you will find that the trees will 
line 22744=>fail, and you  will come to a barren country. There the River flows in stony 
line 22745=>vale amid  high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall 
line 22746=>island  of the Tindrock,  that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its  arms 
line 22747=>about the steep shores of the  isle, and falls then  with a  great noise and 
line 22748=>smoke  over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it 
line 22749=>is called in your  tongue.  That  is a wide region of sluggish fen where the 
line 22750=>stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by 
line 22751=>many 
line 22752=>mouths from the Forest of  Fangorn  in the west. About that stream, on  this 
line 22753=>side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the further side are the bleak hills 
line 22754=>of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over  
line 22755=>the Dead Marshes and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of 
line 22756=>Mordor. 
line 22757=>     'Boromir, and any  that go with him seeking  Minas Tirith, will do well 
line 22758=>to leave the Great River  above Rauros and cross the Entwash before it finds 
line 22759=>the marshes.  Yet  they  should  not  go too far  up  that  stream, nor risk  
line 22760=>becoming entangled in the  Forest of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is 
line 22761=>now  little  known. But  Boromir  and Aragorn  doubtless  do  not  need this 
line 22762=>warning.' 
line 22763=>     'Indeed we have heard  of Fangorn in  Minas Tirith,' said Boromir. `But 
line 22764=>what I have heard seems to me for the most part old wives' tales, such as we  
line 22765=>tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is now  to us so far away 
line 22766=>that fancy can wander freely there. Of old Fangorn lay  upon the  borders of 
line 22767=>our realm; but it is now many lives of men since  any of  us  visited it, to 
line 22768=>prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years. 
line 22769=>     `I have myself  been at whiles in Rohan, but I have  never  crossed  it 
line 22770=>northwards. When I  was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the Gap by 
line 22771=>the skirts  of the White Mountains,  and crossed the Isen  and the Greyflood  
line 22772=>into Northerland.  A  long and wearisome  journey.  Four  hundred  leagues I 
line 22773=>reckoned it, and it took me many  months; for  I lost my horse at Tharbad, at 
line 22774=>the fording  of  the  Greyflood. After that  journey,  and  the road  I have 
line 22775=>
line 22776=>####-trodden  with  this Company, I  do  not much doubt  that I shall find a  way 
line 22777=>through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.' 
line 22778=>     `Then  I need say no more,' said Celeborn. 'But do not despise the lore 
line 22779=>that has come down from distant years; for oft it may chance  that old wives 
line 22780=>keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.' 
line 22781=>     Now Galadriel rose  from the grass, and taking a  cup  from one  of her  
line 22782=>maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn. 
line 22783=>     'Now it is time  to drink the cup of  farewell,' she said. `Drink, Lord 
line 22784=>of  the Galadhrim!  And let not your heart be  sad though night  must follow 
line 22785=>noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.' 
line 22786=>     Then  she brought  the  cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink  
line 22787=>and farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the 
line 22788=>grass,  and  chairs were set  for her and  for Celeborn.  Her maidens   stood 
line 22789=>silent about her, and a while  she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke 
line 22790=>again. 
line 22791=>     'We have drunk  the cup of  parting,' she  said, `and the  shadows fall 
line 22792=>between us. But  before you go,  I have brought in  my ship gifts  which the 
line 22793=>Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer  you in memory of Lothlurien.' 
line 22794=>Then 
line 22795=>she called to each in turn. 
line 22796=>     `Here is  the gift  of Celeborn  and  Galadriel to the  leader  of your 
line 22797=>Company,' she  said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath that had been made 
line 22798=>to fit his sword.  It was  overlaid  with  a  tracery of flowers  and leaves 
line 22799=>wrought of silver and gold, and on it were set in elven runes formed of many 
line 22800=>gems the name And®ril and the lineage of the sword. 
line 22801=>     `The  blade  that  is  drawn from  this  sheath shall  not be stained or  
line 22802=>broken  even in  defeat,' she said. `But is there aught else that you desire 
line 22803=>of me at our parting? For  darkness will flow between us, and it may be that 
line 22804=>we shall  not meet  again, unless it be far  hence upon  a  road that has no 
line 22805=>returning.' 
line 22806=>     And Aragorn answered: 'Lady, you know  all my desire, and  long held in 
line 22807=>keeping the only  treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even 
line 22808=>if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.' 
line 22809=>     `Yet maybe this will lighten  your heart,' said Galadriel;  `for it was 
line 22810=>left in my care to be given to you, should you pass through this land.' Then 
line 22811=>she lifted from  her lap  a  great stone  of a clear green, set in  a silver  
line 22812=>brooch that  was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with  outspread  wings;  
line 22813=>
line 22814=>####-and as  she held  it  up  the gem flashed  like the sun shining through  the 
line 22815=>leaves  of spring. `This  stone I  gave to Celebrnan my daughter, and she to 
line 22816=>hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. In this hour take the name 
line 22817=>that was foretold for you, Elessar, the Elfstone of the house of Elendil! ' 
line 22818=>     Then Aragorn took  the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and 
line 22819=>those  who  saw  him wondered; for they  had  not marked before how tall and 
line 22820=>kingly  he stood, and it seemed to  them that many years of toil  had  fallen 
line 22821=>from his shoulders. `For the  gifts that you have  given me I thank you,' he 
line 22822=>said, 'O Lady of  Lurien of whom were sprung Celebrnan  and Arwen  
line 22823=>Evenstar. 
line 22824=>What praise could I say more? ' 
line 22825=>     The Lady bowed her hea d, and she turned then to Boromir, and to him she 
line 22826=>gave a belt of gold; and to  Merry  and Pippin  she gave small silver belts, 
line 22827=>each  with a  clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas she  gave a bow 
line 22828=>such as  the Galadhrim used,  longer and  stouter than the bows of Mirkwood, 
line 22829=>and strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows.  
line 22830=>     `For you little gardener and lover of trees,' she said to  Sam, `I have 
line 22831=>only a small gift.' She put into his hand a little box of plain  grey  wood, 
line 22832=>unadorned save for  a single silver rune upon the lid.  `Here  is set  G for  
line 22833=>Galadriel,' she said; `but  also it may stand  for garden in your tongue. In 
line 22834=>this box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing  as Galadriel has 
line 22835=>still to bestow  is upon it. It will not keep  you on your  road, nor defend 
line 22836=>you  against any peril; but if you keep it and see your  home again at last, 
line 22837=>then perhaps it may reward  you.  Though you should find all barren and laid 
line 22838=>waste, there will be  few gardens in  Middle-earth that will bloom like your 
line 22839=>garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may  remember  Galadriel, 
line 22840=>and catch a glimpse  far off  of Lurien,  that you  have  seen  only  in our 
line 22841=>winter.  For our spring and our summer are gone  by,  and they will never be 
line 22842=>seen  on earth again save in memory.' 
line 22843=>     Sam  went  red  to  the  ears  and muttered something inaudible, as  he 
line 22844=>clutched the box and bowed as well as he could. 
line 22845=>     `And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves? ' said Galadriel turning 
line 22846=>to Gimli. 
line 22847=>     `None,   Lady,' answered Gimli. `It is  enough for  me  to have seen the 
line 22848=>Lady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.' 
line 22849=>     `Hear all ye Elves! ' she cried to those about her. `Let none say again 
line 22850=>that Dwarves  are grasping  and ungracious! Yet surely, Gimli son of  Gluin, 
line 22851=>
line 22852=>####-you desire something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be 
line 22853=>the only guest without a gift.' 
line 22854=>     `There  is  nothing,  Lady  Galadriel,'  said  Gimli,  bowing  low  and 
line 22855=>stammering. `Nothing, unless it might be-unless it is permitted to ask. nay, 
line 22856=>to name a single strand of your hair, which  surpasses the gold of the earth 
line 22857=>as the stars surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But 
line 22858=>you commanded me to name my desire.' 
line 22859=>     The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at 
line 22860=>the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. 'It is said that the  skill of the 
line 22861=>Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues ' she said; `yet that 
line 22862=>is not true of Gimli. For  none have ever  made to me a request  so bold and 
line 22863=>yet so  courteous. And  how shall I  refuse, since I commanded him to speak? 
line 22864=>But tell me, what would you do with such a gift? ' 
line 22865=>     `Treasure it, Lady,' he answered, `in memory of your words to me at our 
line 22866=>first meeting. And if ever I return to the  smithies of my home, it shall be 
line 22867=>set in imperishable crystal to  be an heirloom of my house, and a  pledge of 
line 22868=>good will between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.' 
line 22869=>     Then the  Lady unbraided  one  of her long tresses, and  cut o ff  three 
line 22870=>golden hairs, and laid them in Gimli's hand. `These words shall  go with the 
line 22871=>gift,' she said. `I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the 
line 22872=>one hand lies darkness, and on the other only hope. But if  hope  should not 
line 22873=>fail, then I sa y to you, Gimli son of Gluin, that your hands shall flow with 
line 22874=>gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion. 
line 22875=>     `And you, Ring-bearer,' she said, turning to Frodo. `I come to you last 
line 22876=>who are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared  this.'  She held up 
line 22877=>a small crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light 
line 22878=>sprang from  her hand.  'In this  phial,' she said, `is  caught the light of 
line 22879=>Edrendil's  star,  set amid  the  waters of my fountain. It will shine still 
line 22880=>brighter when night is  about you. May it be a  light to you in dark places, 
line 22881=>when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel and her Mirror! ' 
line 22882=>     Frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw 
line 22883=>her  again  standing  like a  queen,  great and  beautiful,  but  no  longer  
line 22884=>terrible. He bowed, but found no words to say. 
line 22885=>     Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to  the  hythe. A yellow 
line 22886=>noon lay  on the  green land  of  the Tongue, and  the water  glittered with 
line 22887=>silver. All at last was  made  ready. The Company took  their places in  the 
line 22888=>boats as  before. Crying farewell, the Elves of Lurien with long  grey poles 
line 22889=>
line 22890=>####-thrust them out into the flowing stream, and  the rippling waters bore  them 
line 22891=>slowly  away. The  travellers  sat still  without moving or speaking. On the 
line 22892=>green  bank near to the very point  of the Tongue  the  Lady Galadriel stood 
line 22893=>alone and silent. As they passed her they  turned and their eyes watched her  
line 22894=>slowly  floating away  from  them.  For  so it seemed  to  them:  Lurien was 
line 22895=>slipping  backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees,  sailing 
line 22896=>on to forgotten shores, while they sat  helpless upon the margin of the grey 
line 22897=>and leafless world. 
line 22898=>     Even as they gazed,  the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the 
line 22899=>Great River, and their boats turned  and began to speed southwards. Soon the 
line 22900=>white form of the Lady  was small and  distant. She  shone like a window  of 
line 22901=>glass  upon a far hill in the westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a  
line 22902=>mountain: a  crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then  it seemed to Frodo 
line 22903=>that she lifted her arms in a  final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on 
line 22904=>the following wind came the sound of her voice singing. But now she  sang in 
line 22905=>the  ancient tongue of the Elves  beyond the Sea, and he  did not understand  
line 22906=>the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him. 
line 22907=>     Yet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained  graven in his memory,  
line 22908=>and long afterwards he interpreted  them, as well as he could:  the language 
line 22909=>was that of Elven -song and spoke of things little known on Middle-earth.

line 22928=>####-     Nambril! Nai hiruvalyl Valimar. 
line 22929=>     Nai elyl hiruva. Nambril! 
line 22930=>     `Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the  wind,  long years numberless  as 
line 22931=>the  wings of trees!  The long years have passed like  swift draughts of the 
line 22932=>sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West, beneath the blue  vaults of Varda  
line 22933=>wherein the stars  tremble  in the  song of her voice, holy and queenly. Who  
line 22934=>now shall refill  the cup for me? For now the Kindler, Varda,  the  Queen of 
line 22935=>the Stars,  from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all  
line 22936=>paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country darkness lies on 
line 22937=>the foaming waves between  us, and mist  covers the jewels of Calacirya  for  
line 22938=>ever. Now lost, lost to those from the East is Valimar! Farewell! Maybe thou 
line 22939=>shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell!  ' Varda is the 
line 22940=>name of that Lady whom the Elves in these lands of exile name Elbereth. 
line 22941=>     Suddenly the River  swept round a bend, and the banks rose  upon either 
line 22942=>side, and the light of Lurien was hidden. To that fair land Frodo never came 
line 22943=>again. 
line 22944=>     The travellers  now  turned their faces  to  the journey;  the  sun was 
line 22945=>before  them, and their  eyes were dazzled, for all were  filled with tears. 
line 22946=>Gimli wept openly. 
line 22947=>     `I have  looked  the  last  upon that which was  fairest,' he  said  to 
line 22948=>Legolas his companion. `Henceforward I will call  nothing fair, unless it be 
line 22949=>her gift.' He put his hand to his breast. 
line 22950=>     `Tell me,  Legolas, why  did I  come on this Quest?  Little did I  know 
line 22951=>where  the  chief peril  lay!  Truly Elrond spoke, saying that we  could not 
line 22952=>foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger 
line 22953=>that I feared, and it did not hold me back. But I would not have come, had I 
line 22954=>known the  danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in  this 
line 22955=>parting, even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Lord. Alas for 
line 22956=>Gimli son of Gluin! ' 
line 22957=>     `Nay! ' said Legolas. `Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world 
line 22958=>in these after -days. For  such is the  way of  it:  to find and lose,  as it 
line 22959=>seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed, 
line 22960=>Gimli son of Gluin: for your loss you suffer of your own  free will, and you  
line 22961=>might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken  your companions, 
line 22962=>and 
line 22963=>the least reward that you shall have is that  the memory of Lothlurien shall 
line 22964=>remain ever clear  and unstained in your heart, and  shall neither  fade nor  
line 22965=>
line 22966=>####-grow stale.' 
line 22967=>     `Maybe,' said  Gimli;  `and  I  thank you  for  your words.  True words 
line 22968=>doubtless; yet all  such  comfort  is cold.  Memory  is not  what  the heart 
line 22969=>desires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheled-zvram. Or  so says the 
line 22970=>heart  of Gimli  the Dwarf. Elves  may see  things otherwise.  Indeed I have 
line 22971=>heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream. 
line 22972=>Not so for Dwarves.  
line 22973=>     'But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in the 
line 22974=>water with all this baggage, and  the Great River is swift. I do not wish to 
line 22975=>drown my grief in cold water.' He took up  a paddle, and steered towards the 
line 22976=>western bank, following Aragorn's boat ahead, which had already moved out of 
line 22977=>the middle stream. 
line 22978=>     So the  Company went on their long way, down the wide  hurrying waters,  
line 22979=>borne ever  southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could 
line 22980=>not see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze died  away and the River 
line 22981=>flowed without a sound. No voice  of  bird broke the silence.  The  sun grew 
line 22982=>misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky  like a high white 
line 22983=>pearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came  early, followed by a grey 
line 22984=>and  starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours they  floated on, guiding 
line 22985=>their boats under the overhanging shadows  of the western woods. Great trees 
line 22986=>passed  by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty  roots  through  the 
line 22987=>mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and  listened to 
line 22988=>the  faint lap and  gurgle  of  the River fretting among the  tree-roots and 
line 22989=>driftwood near the shore, until  his  head nodded and he fell into an uneasy 
line 22990=>sleep. 
line 22991=> 
line 22992=>
line 22993=>####- 
line 22994=>
line 22995=>Chapter 9. The Great River 
line 22996=>
line 22997=> 
line 22998=> 
line 22999=>     Frodo  was roused  by Sam. He found  that  he was  lying, well wrapped,  
line 23000=>under tall grey-skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west 
line 23001=>bank of the  Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night  away, and the grey 
line 23002=>of morning was dim among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire 
line 23003=>near at hand. 
line 23004=>     They started  again  before   the day  was broad.  Not that most of  the 
line 23005=>Company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision, 
line 23006=>which they must make at  latest  when they came  to  Rauros and the Tindrock  
line 23007=>Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the River  bear them on at its 
line 23008=>own  pace,  having no desire to hasten  towards  the perils that lay beyond, 
line 23009=>whichever course they  took in  the end. Aragorn  let  them  drift with  the 
line 23010=>stream as they wished, husbanding their  strength against weariness to come.  
line 23011=>But he insisted that at least they should  start early  each day and journey 
line 23012=>on  far into the evening; for he felt  in his heart that  time was pressing, 
line 23013=>and he  feared that the Dark Lord  had not been idle while  they lingered in 
line 23014=>Lurien. 
line 23015=>     Nonetheless  they saw no sign of  an enemy that  day, nor the next. The 
line 23016=>dull grey hours passed without event. As the third  day of their voyage wore 
line 23017=>on the lands changed slowly: the trees  thinned and  then failed altogether. 
line 23018=>On  the eastern bank to their left  they saw long formless slopes stretching 
line 23019=>up and away toward the sky; brown and withered they  looked, as  if fire had 
line 23020=>passed  over them, leaving no  living  blade of green:  an  unfriendly waste 
line 23021=>without even a broken tree or a  bold  stone to relieve the  emptiness. They 
line 23022=>had come to  the Brown Lands  that lay, vast and  desolate, between Southern 
line 23023=>Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence or war or evil deed 
line 23024=>of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell. 
line 23025=>     Upon the west to their  right the land was treeless  also,  but it  was 
line 23026=>flat, and  in many places green  with wide plains of grass. On this side  of 
line 23027=>the River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all 
line 23028=>view to  the  west,  as  the  little  boats  went   rustling by  along  their 
line 23029=>fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in  the light 
line 23030=>cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and there through  openings  Frodo 
line 23031=>could catch sudden  glimpses of rolling meads, and far  beyond them hills in 
line 23032=>
line 23033=>####-the  sunset, and  away on  the edge of sight a dark line, where marched  the 
line 23034=>southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains.  
line 23035=>     There was no sign of living moving  things,  save birds. Of these there 
line 23036=>were many: small  fowl whistling  and  piping in  the reeds,  but  they were 
line 23037=>seldom seen.  Once  or  twice the  travellers  heard  the rush  and whine of 
line 23038=>swan-wings, and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky. 
line 23039=>     `Swans! ' said Sam. `And mighty big ones too! ' 
line 23040=>     `Yes,' said Aragorn, 'and they are black swans.' 
line 23041=>     `How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks! '  said Frodo.  
line 23042=>`I  always imagined  that as one journeyed  south it got warmer and merrier,  
line 23043=>until winter was left behind for ever.' 
line 23044=>     'But we  have not journeyed  far south yet,'  answered Aragorn. `It  is 
line 23045=>still winter, and we are far from the sea. Here the world  is cold until the 
line 23046=>sudden spring, and we  may yet have snow again. Far away down in the Bay  of 
line 23047=>Belfalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but 
line 23048=>for the  Enemy. But here we are  not above sixty  leagues, I guess, south of 
line 23049=>the Southfarthing away in your Shire, hundreds of long miles yonder. You are 
line 23050=>looking now south-west across the north  plains of the Riddermark, Rohan the 
line 23051=>land of the Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight 
line 23052=>that runs  down from Fangorn to join  the  Great  River. That  is  the north 
line 23053=>boundary  of Rohan; and  of old all that lay between  Limlight and the White 
line 23054=>Mountains belonged to the Rohirrim. It  is a rich and pleasant land, and its 
line 23055=>grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or  
line 23056=>ride often  to its shores.  Anduin  is  wide, yet  the orcs  can shoot their 
line 23057=>arrows  far across  the stream; and of late, it is said,  they have dared to 
line 23058=>cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan.' 
line 23059=>     Sam looked from bank to  bank  uneasily. The trees had  seemed  hostile 
line 23060=>before, as if they harboured secret eyes and  lurking dangers; now he wished  
line 23061=>that  the trees were still  there. He felt  that the  Company was too naked, 
line 23062=>afloat in  little open  boats  in  the midst of shelterless  lands, and on a  
line 23063=>river that was the frontier of war. 
line 23064=>     In  the  next day  or two, as they went on, borne  steadily southwards, 
line 23065=>this feeling  of insecurity grew  on  all the Company. For  a whole day they 
line 23066=>took to  their  paddles  and  hastened forward. The banks  slid by. Soon the 
line 23067=>River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east, 
line 23068=>and  there were  gravel-shoals  in  the water, so that  careful steering was 
line 23069=>needed. The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air 
line 23070=>
line 23071=>####-from  the  East. On  the  other  side the meads had  become rolling downs of 
line 23072=>withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of 
line 23073=>the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlurien. There 
line 23074=>was little speech and  no laughter  in any of  the boats. Each member of the 
line 23075=>Company was busy with his own thoughts.  
line 23076=>     The heart of  Legolas was running under  the stars of a summer night in 
line 23077=>some  northern glade amid  the beech-woods; Gimli  was fingering gold in his 
line 23078=>mind, and wondering if it were  fit to be  wrought into the  housing  of the 
line 23079=>Lady's gift.  Merry and  Pippin in the middle  boat  were  ill at  ease, for  
line 23080=>Boromir sat muttering  to himself, sometimes biting his nails,  as  if  some 
line 23081=>restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes  seizing a paddle and  driving 
line 23082=>the boat  close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat  in  the bow  looking 
line 23083=>back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo.  
line 23084=>Sam had  long  ago  made up his mind  that,  though boats were maybe  not as 
line 23085=>dangerous  as  he  had been  brought  up  to  believe,  they were  far  more 
line 23086=>uncomfortable  than even  he had  imagined. He was   cramped  and  miserable, 
line 23087=>having nothing to do but stare at the winter -lands crawling by and the  grey 
line 23088=>water on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in use they  did not 
line 23089=>trust Sam with one. 
line 23090=>     As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed 
line 23091=>heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and 
line 23092=>longed 
line 23093=>for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his 
line 23094=>sight: at first he stared  at it listlessly, then  he sat  up and rubbed his 
line 23095=>eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more. 
line 23096=>     That night they camped  on a small eyot close to  the western bank. Sam 
line 23097=>lay rolled  in  blankets  beside Frodo. `I had a funny dream an hour or  two 
line 23098=>before we  stopped, Mr.  Frodo,' he said. `Or maybe it wasn't a dream. Funny 
line 23099=>it was anyway.' 
line 23100=>     `Well,  what was it? ' said  Frodo,  knowing that  Sam would not settle 
line 23101=>down until he had told his tale, whatever it was. 'I haven't seen or thought 
line 23102=>of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlurien.' 
line 23103=>     `It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo.  It was  queer.  All wrong, if it 
line 23104=>wasn't a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with 
line 23105=>eyes!  ' 
line 23106=>     `The log's  all right,' said Frodo.  `There are  many in the River. But 
line 23107=>leave out the eyes!  ' 
line 23108=>
line 23109=>####-     `That I won't,'  said Sam. ` 'Twas  the eyes as made me sit  up,  so to 
line 23110=>speak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind 
line 23111=>Gimli's boat; but I didn't  give much heed to it. Then  it seemed as if  the 
line 23112=>log  was slowly  catching us  up. And  that  was peculiar, as you might say, 
line 23113=>seeing as we were all  floating on  the stream together. Just then I saw the 
line 23114=>eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a hump at the  near end of the 
line 23115=>log. What's  more, it  wasn't a  log, for it had  paddle-feet, like a swan's 
line 23116=>almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water. 
line 23117=>     'That's when  I sat right up  and rubbed  my  eyes,  meaning  to give a  
line 23118=>shout,  if  it was still there  when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head.  
line 23119=>For the whatever -it-was was coming along fast now and  getting close  behind 
line 23120=>Gimli. But whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring, or whether 
line 23121=>I came to my senses, I don't know. When I looked again, it wasn't there. Yet  
line 23122=>I  think I caught a glimpse with  the tail  of-my eye, as the saying  is, of 
line 23123=>something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank. I couldn't see no more 
line 23124=>eyes though. 
line 23125=>     `I said to myself: "dreaming again, Sam Gamgee," I said: and  I said no 
line 23126=>more just then. But  I've been  thinking since. and now I'm not so sure. What 
line 23127=>do you make of it, Mr. Frodo? ' 
line 23128=>     'I  should make nothing of it  but a log and the dusk and sleep in your 
line 23129=>eyes Sam, said  Frodo, if this was the  first  time that those eyes had been 
line 23130=>seen. But it isn't. I saw them away back north before we reached Lurien. And 
line 23131=>I saw  a strange creature with eyes climbing to the  flet that night. Haldir 
line 23132=>saw it too. And do you remember the report of the  Elves that went after the  
line 23133=>orc-band?  ' 
line 23134=>     `Ah,'  said  Sam. `I  do;  and  I remember  more too.  I don't  like my 
line 23135=>thoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and Mr. Bilbo's stories and 
line 23136=>all, I fancy I  could put a name on the creature,  at a guess. A nasty name. 
line 23137=>Gollum, maybe?  ' 
line 23138=>     `Yes, that  is what  I  have feared for  some  time,' said  Frodo. `Ever  
line 23139=>since  the night on the flet. I suppose he was lurking in Moria, and  picked 
line 23140=>up our trail then;  but I hoped that our stay in Lurien would throw  him off 
line 23141=>the scent again. The miserable creature must  have  been hiding in the woods 
line 23142=>by the Silverlode, watching us start off! ' 
line 23143=>     `That's about it,'  said Sam. `And  we'd better be a  bit more watchful 
line 23144=>ourselves,  or we'll  feel some  nasty fingers  round our necks one of these 
line 23145=>nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. And   that's what I  was leading 
line 23146=>
line 23147=>####-up to. No need to trouble  Strider or the others tonight. I'll keep watch. I 
line 23148=>can sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.' 
line 23149=>     `I might,' said Frodo, `and I might say "luggage with eyes".  You shall 
line 23150=>watch; but only if  you promise  to  wake me  halfway  towards  morning,  if 
line 23151=>nothing happens before then.' 
line 23152=>     In the  dead hours Frodo came out  of a  deep dark  sleep  to find  Sam 
line 23153=>shaking him. `It's a shame to wake you,' whispered Sam, `but that's what you 
line 23154=>said. There's  nothing  to  tell,  or not much. I thought I heard  some soft  
line 23155=>plashing and a sniffing noise, a while  back;  but  you hear  a lot  of such 
line 23156=>queer sounds by a river at night.' 
line 23157=>     He lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets,   and fought off 
line 23158=>his sleep. Minutes or hours passed  slowly, and  nothing happened. Frodo was 
line 23159=>just yielding  to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly 
line 23160=>visible, floated close to one of the moored boats. A long whitish hand could  
line 23161=>be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes 
line 23162=>shone coldly as  they peered inside, and then they  lifted  and gazed up  at 
line 23163=>Frodo  on the eyot. They were not more than a yard or  two  away,  and Frodo 
line 23164=>heard  the  soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its 
line 23165=>sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut  off. There was 
line 23166=>another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream  into 
line 23167=>the night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up` 
line 23168=>     'What is it? ' he whispered, springing  up and coming to Frodo. `I felt 
line 23169=>something in my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword? ' 
line 23170=>     `Gollum,' answered Frodo. 'Or at least, so I guess.' 
line 23171=>     `Ah! '  said Aragorn. `So you know about our little footpad, do you? He 
line 23172=>padded after us all through Moria and right down to Nimrodel. Since we  took  
line 23173=>to boats,  he has been lying on a  log  and paddling with  hands and feet. I 
line 23174=>have tried  to catch him once or twice at night; but he is slier than a fox, 
line 23175=>and a s slippery as a  fish. I hoped the river -voyage would beat him, but  he 
line 23176=>is too clever a waterman. 
line 23177=>     `We  shall have to  try going faster tomorrow. You lie down  now, and I 
line 23178=>will keep watch for what is left of the night.  I wish I could  lay my hands 
line 23179=>on the wretch.  We might make him useful. But if I cannot, we shall have  to 
line 23180=>try  and lose him. He is very dangerous. Quite apart from murder by night on 
line 23181=>his own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track.' 
line 23182=>     The night  passed without  Gollum showing  so  much as  a shadow again. 
line 23183=>After that the Company kept a sharp look -out, but they saw no more of Gollum 
line 23184=>
line 23185=>####-while  the voyage lasted.  If he  was still following, he  was very wary and 
line 23186=>cunning.  At Aragorn's bidding they paddled now  for  long  spells, and  the 
line 23187=>banks went  swiftly  by.  But  they  saw little  of the  country,  for  they 
line 23188=>journeyed mostly by night and  twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden  
line 23189=>as the  land  allowed.  In this way the  time passed without event until the 
line 23190=>seventh day. 
line 23191=>     The weather was still grey and overcast,  with  wind from the East, but 
line 23192=>as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint 
line 23193=>light,  yellow and pale green, opened under  the grey shores of cloud. There 
line 23194=>the white rind of the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes.  
line 23195=>Sam looked at it and puckered his brows.  
line 23196=>     The next  day the  country on either side began to change  rapidly. The 
line 23197=>banks began to rise and grow stony.  Soon they were passing through a  hilly 
line 23198=>rocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes 
line 23199=>of thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers. Behind them stood low 
line 23200=>crumbling  cliffs, and  chimneys of  grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and 
line 23201=>beyond  these again there  rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen  firs.  
line 23202=>They were  drawing near to  the  grey  hill-country of  the  Emyn  Muil, the 
line 23203=>southern march of Wilderland. 
line 23204=>     There were many birds about the cliffs and  the  rock -chimneys, and all 
line 23205=>day high in  the  air flocks of  birds  had been circling, black against the 
line 23206=>pale sky. As  they  lay  in their  camp that day Aragorn watched the flights 
line 23207=>doubtfully, wondering if Gollum had been doing some mischief and the news 
line 23208=>of 
line 23209=>their voyage was now moving in the wilderness. Later as the sun was setting, 
line 23210=>and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a  
line 23211=>dark  spot against the  fading light:  a  great bird high  and far  off, now 
line 23212=>wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards. 
line 23213=>     'What is that, Legolas? ' he  asked, pointing to the northern sky.  'Is 
line 23214=>it, as I think. an eagle? ' 
line 23215=>     'Yes.' said  Legolas.  `It is an eagle, a hunting  eagle. I wonder what 
line 23216=>that forebodes. It is far from the mountains.' 
line 23217=>     `We will not start until it is fully dark,' said Aragorn. 
line 23218=>     The eighth night of their journey came. It was silent and windless; the 
line 23219=>grey east wind had passed away. The thin  crescent  of the  Moon had  fallen  
line 23220=>early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away 
line 23221=>in the South there were great ranges of cloud that still  shone faintly,  in 
line 23222=>
line 23223=>####-the West stars glinted bright. 
line 23224=>     `Come! ' said Aragorn. `We will  venture one more journey  by night. We 
line 23225=>are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know well: for I have never  
line 23226=>journeyed by water  in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of 
line 23227=>Sarn  Gebir. But if I am right in my reckoning, those are  still many  miles 
line 23228=>ahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and 
line 23229=>stony  eyots in the stream. We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle  
line 23230=>swiftly.' 
line 23231=>     To Sam in  the leading  boat  was given the  task  of watchman. He  lay 
line 23232=>forward peering into the  gloom.  The night grew dark,  but the stars  above 
line 23233=>were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer On the face of the River.  It 
line 23234=>was close  on  midnight,  and they had been drifting for  some while. hardly  
line 23235=>using the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out.  Only a few yards ahead dark 
line 23236=>shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water. There 
line 23237=>was  a swift  current which swung left,  towards the eastern shore where the 
line 23238=>channel was clear. As they were swept aside  the travellers could  see,  now 
line 23239=>very close, the pale foam of the River lashing against sharp rocks that were 
line 23240=>thrust out  far  into the stream like a  ridge of  teeth. The boats were all 
line 23241=>huddled together. 
line 23242=>     `Hoy  there, Aragorn! '  shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped  into  the 
line 23243=>leader.  `This is madness! We cannot  dare the Rapids  by night! But no boat 
line 23244=>can live in Sarn Gebir, be it night or  day.' 
line 23245=>     `Back,  back! ' cried Aragorn. 'Turn! Turn if you can!  '  He drove his 
line 23246=>paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring it round. 
line 23247=>     'I am  out of my reckoning,' he said to Frodo.  'I did not know that we 
line 23248=>had come so  far: Anduin  fl ows faster  than I thought.  Sarn Gebir must  be 
line 23249=>close at hand already.' 
line 23250=>     With  great  efforts  they  checked  the boats and slowly brought  them 
line 23251=>about; but at first they  could make only small headway against the current, 
line 23252=>and all  the time they were  carried nearer and  nearer to the eastern bank. 
line 23253=>Now dark and ominous it loomed up in the night. 
line 23254=>     'All together,  paddle!  '  shouted  Boromir. 'Paddle! Or  we  shall be 
line 23255=>driven on the  shoals.' Even as  he  spoke  Frodo felt the  keel beneath him 
line 23256=>grate upon stone. 
line 23257=>     At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled  
line 23258=>over  them, and some fell among them. One smote Frodo between the  
line 23259=>shoulders 
line 23260=>
line 23261=>####-and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell 
line 23262=>back. foiled by his hidden  coat of mail. Another passed  through  Aragorn's 
line 23263=>hood; and a  third  stood fast in the gunwale of  the  second boat, close by 
line 23264=>Merry's hand. Sam thought he could glimpse black  figures running to and fro 
line 23265=>upon the long  shingle-banks that lay under  the eastern shore.  They seemed 
line 23266=>very near. 
line 23267=>     `Yrch!' said Legolas, falling into his own tongue. 
line 23268=>     `Orcs! ' cried Gimli. 
line 23269=>     `Gollum's doing, I'll be bound.' said  Sam to Frodo. `And  a nice place 
line 23270=>to choose, too. The River seems set on taking us right into their arms! ' 
line 23271=>     They all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a hand. 
line 23272=>Every moment they expected to feel the bite  of black -feathered arrows. Many 
line 23273=>whined overhead or struck the  water nearby; but there were no more hits. It  
line 23274=>was dark,  but  not  too  dark  for  the  night-eyes of  Orcs,  and  in  the 
line 23275=>star-glimmer they must have offered  their cunning foes some mark, unless it 
line 23276=>was that  the grey cloaks Of Lurien and  the grey timber of the  elf-wrought 
line 23277=>boats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor. 
line 23278=>     Stroke by  stroke they  laboured on. In the darkness it  was hard to be 
line 23279=>sure that they were indeed moving at  all; but slowly the swirl of the water  
line 23280=>grew less, and the  shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night . At 
line 23281=>last, as far as they  could judge, they had reached the middle of the stream 
line 23282=>again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks.  
line 23283=>Then  half turning they  thrust them  with all  their  strength towards  the 
line 23284=>western shore. Under  the  shadow Of bushes leaning  out  over the water they 
line 23285=>halted and drew breath. 
line 23286=>     Legolas laid down his paddle and took  up the  bow that he had  brought 
line 23287=>from  Lurien. Then he  sprang ashore  and climbed  a few paces up  the bank. 
line 23288=>Stringing the bow  and  fitting an arrow  he turned, peering back  over  the 
line 23289=>River into  the darkness.  Across  the water  there were  shrill  cries, but 
line 23290=>nothing could be seen. 
line 23291=>     Frodo looked up at the Elf  standing tall above him, as he  gazed  into 
line 23292=>the night, seeking a mark to shoot at. His head was dark, crowned with sharp 
line 23293=>white  stars that glittered in  the  black pools  of the sky behind. But now 
line 23294=>rising and sailing up from the South the great clouds advanced, sending  out 
line 23295=>dark outriders into the starry fields. A sudden dread fell on the Company. 
line 23296=>     `Elbereth Gilthoniel!' sighed Legolas as he  looked up.  Even as he did 
line 23297=>so,  a dark shape, like a cloud and yet  not a cloud, for it moved far  more 
line 23298=>
line 23299=>####-swiftly,  came out  of the blackness in  the  South,  and  sped towards  the 
line 23300=>Company, blotting out  all  light as it approached. Soon  it  appeared as  a  
line 23301=>great  winged creature, blacker  than the pits in  the night. Fierce  voices 
line 23302=>rose up to greet it from across the water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running 
line 23303=>through him and clutching  at his heart;  there was  a deadly cold, like the 
line 23304=>memory of an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if to hide. 
line 23305=>     Suddenly  the great bow of  Lurien sang. Shrill went the arrow from the 
line 23306=>elven-string.  Frodo looked up. Almost above  him the  winged shape swerved. 
line 23307=>There was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down 
line 23308=>into the gloom of  the eastern  shore. The sky was clean again.  There was a  
line 23309=>tumult  of many voices far away, cursing and  wailing in  the darkness,  and  
line 23310=>then silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night. 
line 23311=>     After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They felt  their way 
line 23312=>along  the water's edge for some distance, until they  found a small shallow 
line 23313=>bay. A  few low  trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a  
line 23314=>steep  rocky  bank. Here the Company decided to stay and await the  dawn: it 
line 23315=>was useless  to attempt to move further by night.  They made no camp and lit 
line 23316=>no fire, but lay huddled in the boats, moored close together. 
line 23317=>     'Praised be  the bow  of Galadriel, and the  hand and eye of Legolas! ' 
line 23318=>said Gimli, as he munched a wafer of lembas. 'That was a mighty shot in  the 
line 23319=>dark, my friend!' 
line 23320=>     'But who can say what it hit?' said Legolas. 
line 23321=>     'I cannot,' said Gimli. `But  I am glad that the shadow came no nearer. 
line 23322=>I liked it not at all. Too much it reminded me of the shadow in Moria -- the 
line 23323=>shadow of the Balrog,' he ended in a whisper. 
line 23324=>     'It  was not a Balrog,' said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that 
line 23325=>had come upon him.  'It was  something  colder.  I think it was   --' Then he 
line 23326=>paused and fell silent. 
line 23327=>     'What do you think? ' asked Boromir eagerly, leaning  from his boat, as 
line 23328=>if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo's face. 
line 23329=>     `I think -- No, I will not say,' answered Frodo. `Whatever it was,  its 
line 23330=>fall has dismayed our enemies.' 
line 23331=>     `So  it seems,' said Aragorn. `Yet where they  are,  and how many,  and 
line 23332=>what they will do next, we do not know. This night we must all be sleepless!  
line 23333=>Dark hides  us now. Bu t what the  day  will  show  who can tell?  Have  your 
line 23334=>weapons close to hand! ' 
line 23335=>     Sam  sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he  were  counting on  his 
line 23336=>
line 23337=>####-fingers, and looking up at  the sky. `It's very strange,' he  murmured. `The  
line 23338=>Moon's the same in the Shire  and  in  Wilderland, or  it  ought  to be. But 
line 23339=>either it's out of its running, or  I'm all  wrong  in my  reckoning. You'll 
line 23340=>remember,  Mr. Frodo, the  Moon was waning as we lay on the  flet up in that 
line 23341=>tree: a  week from the full,  I reckon. And we'd been a week on the way last  
line 23342=>night, when up pops  a New Moon as thin as a nail -paring, as if we had never 
line 23343=>stayed no time in the Elvish country. 
line 23344=>     `Well, I can  remember three  nights  there for certain,  and I seem to 
line 23345=>remember several more, but I would   take my oath it was never a whole month. 
line 23346=>Anyone would think that time did not count in there! ' 
line 23347=>     `And perhaps that was the way of it,' said Frodo. `In that land, maybe, 
line 23348=>we  were in  a time that has elsewhere long gone by. It was  not,  I  think, 
line 23349=>until Silverlode bore us  back to Anduin that we returned  to the time  that 
line 23350=>flows through mortal lands to the Great Sea. And I don't  remember any moon, 
line 23351=>either new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.' 
line 23352=>     Legolas stirred in his boa t. `Nay, time does  not tarry ever,' he said; 
line 23353=>`but change and growth is not in all  things and places alike. For the Elves 
line 23354=>the world moves, and it  moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because 
line 23355=>they  themselves change little,  and all else  fleets by:  it is a  grief to 
line 23356=>them. Slow, because they do not count the running years, not for themselves. 
line 23357=>The  passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in  the long long stream. 
line 23358=>Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end at last.' 
line 23359=>     `But the wearing is slow in Lurien,' said Frodo. `The power of the Lady 
line 23360=>is on it.  Rich are  the hours,  though short they  seem, in Caras Galadhon, 
line 23361=>where Galadriel wields the Elven -ring.' 
line 23362=>     'That should not have  been said  outside Lurien, not even to me,' said 
line 23363=>Aragorn. `Speak no more of it! But so it is, Sam: in that land you lost your 
line 23364=>count.  There time  flowed swiftly by  us,  as  for the Elves. The  old moon 
line 23365=>passed,  and  a new  moon waxed  and waned  in  the world  outside, while we 
line 23366=>tarried there. And yestereve a  new  moon came again.  Winter is nearly gone. 
line 23367=>Time flows on to a spring of little hope.' 
line 23368=>     The night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again  across the 
line 23369=>water. The  travellers  huddled  in  their  boats  felt the  changing of the 
line 23370=>weather. The air grew  warm and very still under the great moist clouds that 
line 23371=>had floated up from the South and the distant seas. The rushing of the River  
line 23372=>over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow  louder and closer. The twigs of 
line 23373=>the trees above them began to drip. 
line 23374=>
line 23375=>####-     When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft  and 
line 23376=>sad. Slowly  the dawn grew  to a  pale light, diffused and shadowless. There 
line 23377=>was mist on the River, and white fog  swathed the shore; the far  bank could 
line 23378=>not be seen. 
line 23379=>     `I can't abide fog,' said  Sam; `but this  seems to be a lucky one. Now 
line 23380=>perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins seeing us.' 
line 23381=>     `Perhaps so,'  said Aragorn. `But it  will  be  hard to find  the  path 
line 23382=>unless the fog lifts a little later on. And we must find the path, if we are 
line 23383=>to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.' 
line 23384=>     'I  do  not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the  River  any 
line 23385=>further,' said Boromir. `If the Emyn Muil lie before us, then we can abandon 
line 23386=>these cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward, until we come to  the 
line 23387=>Entwash and cross into my own land.' 
line 23388=>     `We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,' said Aragorn, `but that is 
line 23389=>not yet agreed. And such a course  may be more perilous than  it sounds. The 
line 23390=>vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those 
line 23391=>on foot and laden. I would not abandon our boats until we must. The River is 
line 23392=>at least a path that cannot be missed.' 
line 23393=>     `But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,' objected  Boromir. `And even if 
line 23394=>you pass the Gates  of  Argonath and come  unmolested  to the Tindrock, what 
line 23395=>will you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes? ' 
line 23396=>     `No! ' answered Aragorn. `Say rather that we will bear our boats by the 
line 23397=>ancient  way to  Rauros-foot, and  there take to the water again. Do you not 
line 23398=>know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North Stair, and the high seat 
line 23399=>upon  Amon Hen,  that were made in the  days of the great  kings? I at least 
line 23400=>have a mind  to stand in that high place again,  before I decide  my further  
line 23401=>course. There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.' 
line 23402=>     Boromir held out  long  against this choice;  but  when it became plain 
line 23403=>that Frodo  would  follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he gave  in. 'It is not 
line 23404=>the  way  of the  Men of Minas Tirith to  desert their friends at  need,' he 
line 23405=>said, `and you will need my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock. 
line 23406=>To the tall isle I will go, but no further. There  I shall  turn to my home, 
line 23407=>alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship.' 
line 23408=>     The day  was  now  growing,  and  the fog  had lifted a  little. It was 
line 23409=>decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward along the  shore, 
line 23410=>while the  others remained  by the  boats. Aragorn hoped to find some way by 
line 23411=>which they could carry  both  their boats and their  baggage to the smoother  
line 23412=>
line 23413=>####-water beyond the Rapids.  
line 23414=>     `Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,' he said, `but that does not 
line 23415=>say that  we should come through Sarn  Gebir  alive.  None have ever done so 
line 23416=>yet. No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region, for even in their 
line 23417=>great  days  their realm did not reach up  Anduin beyond the Emyn  Muil; but 
line 23418=>there is a portage-way somewhere on  the western shore, if I can find it. It 
line 23419=>cannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey  out of Wilderland 
line 23420=>down to Osgiliath, and still did so until a few years ago, when the Orcs  of 
line 23421=>Mordor began to multiply.' 
line 23422=>     'Seldom in my life has any boat come  out of  the North,  and  the Orcs 
line 23423=>prowl on the east-shore,' said Boromir. `If you go forward, peril  will grow 
line 23424=>with every mile, even if you find a path.' 
line 23425=>     `Peril lies ahead on every southward road,' answered Aragorn. `Wait for  
line 23426=>us one day.  If we do  not return in that time, you will know that  evil has 
line 23427=>indeed befa llen us. Then you must take a new leader  and follow him as  best 
line 23428=>you can.' 
line 23429=>     It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb  the 
line 23430=>steep bank and vanish into the  mists; but his fears proved groundless. Only 
line 23431=>two or three hours had passed, and it  was barely mid-day, when  the shadowy 
line 23432=>shapes of the explorers appeared again. 
line 23433=>     `All is well,' said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. 'There is a  
line 23434=>track,  and  it leads  to  a good landing  that  is still  serviceable.  The 
line 23435=>distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half  a mile below  us,  
line 23436=>and  they  are little more than a mile long.  Not far beyond them the stream 
line 23437=>becomes clear  and  smooth again,  though it runs  swiftly. Our hardest task  
line 23438=>will be to get our boats and baggage   to the old  portage-way. We have found 
line 23439=>it, but it lies well  back from  the water -side here, and runs under the lee 
line 23440=>of  a rock -wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the 
line 23441=>northward  landing  lies. If it  still  remains,  we  must  have  passed  it 
line 23442=>yesterday night. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the  fog. I 
line 23443=>fear we must leave the River now, and make  for the  portage-way  as best we 
line 23444=>can from here.' 
line 23445=>     `That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,' said Boromir. 
line 23446=>     `Yet such as we are we will try it,' said Aragorn. 
line 23447=>     'Aye, we  will,' said Gimli. `The legs of Men will lag on a rough road, 
line 23448=>while a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own weight, Master Boromir! ' 
line 23449=>     The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were 
line 23450=>
line 23451=>####-taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a  
line 23452=>level space. Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. They 
line 23453=>were  far less heavy than any  had  expected.  Of what  tree growing in  the 
line 23454=>elvish country  they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was 
line 23455=>tough 
line 23456=>and yet strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could  carry their boat with 
line 23457=>ease  along the  flat. Nonetheless it  needed the strength of the two Men to 
line 23458=>lift  and haul them  over the ground that the  Company  now had to cross. It 
line 23459=>sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of  grey  limestone-boulders,  
line 23460=>with many hidden holes  shrouded with weeds and bushes;  there were thickets 
line 23461=>of brambles,  and sheer dells;  and here and there boggy pools fed by waters 
line 23462=>trickling from the terraces further inland. 
line 23463=>     One  by  one  Boromir and  Aragorn  carried the boats, while the others 
line 23464=>toiled  and scrambled after them with the baggage. At last  all was  removed 
line 23465=>and laid  on the  portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from 
line 23466=>sprawling briars and many fallen  stones, they  moved forward all  together.  
line 23467=>Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock -wall, and to their left mist 
line 23468=>shrouded the River: they  could hear it  rushing  and foaming over the sharp 
line 23469=>shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not see it. Twice they 
line 23470=>made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing. 
line 23471=>     There the portage-way, turning back  to the water -side, ran gently down 
line 23472=>to the shallow edge of a little pool. It seemed to have been  scooped in the 
line 23473=>river -side, not by hand,  but by the  water  swirling  down  from Sarn Gebir 
line 23474=>against a low pier of  rock that jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond  
line 23475=>it the shore rose sheer into a grey  cliff, and there was no further passage 
line 23476=>for those on foot. 
line 23477=>     Already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing 
line 23478=>in. They sat beside the water listening to the confused rush and roar of the 
line 23479=>Rapids hidden in the mist; they wer e tired and sleepy, and their hearts were 
line 23480=>as gloomy as the dying day. 
line 23481=>     'Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,' said Boromir. 
line 23482=>`We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to pass the Gates of Argonath 
line 23483=>by night, we are all too tired-except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.' 
line 23484=>     Gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat. 
line 23485=>     `Let us rest as much  as  we can now,' said  Aragorn. `Tomorrow we must 
line 23486=>journey by day again. Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we 
line 23487=>shall have  a good chance  of slipping through, unseen  by any eyes  on  the 
line 23488=>
line 23489=>####-eastern shore. But tonight two must watch together in turns: three hours off 
line 23490=>and one on guard.' 
line 23491=>     Nothing happened that night  worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour 
line 23492=>before dawn. As soon as it was fully light they started. Already the fog was 
line 23493=>thinning. They kept as  close as they could  to  the western  side, and they 
line 23494=>could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls 
line 23495=>with  their  feet in the hurrying river. In the mid-morning the  clouds drew 
line 23496=>down  lower,  and it began to rain heavily. They drew  the  skin-covers over  
line 23497=>their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted on: little could 
line 23498=>be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains. 
line 23499=>     The rain,  however, did  not  last  long.  Slowly  the  sky above  grew 
line 23500=>lighter,  and  then  suddenly the clouds broke,  and  their draggled fringes 
line 23501=>trailed away northward up the  River. The  fogs and mists were  gone. Before 
line 23502=>the travellers  lay  a wide ravine, with  great rocky sides to which  clung, 
line 23503=>upon  shelves  and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn  trees. The channel grew 
line 23504=>narrower and the River swifter. Now  they were speeding  along  with  little  
line 23505=>hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a  
line 23506=>lane of pale-blue sky, around them  the dark overshadowed  River, and before 
line 23507=>them  black, shutting out  the  sun,  the hills of  Emyn Muil, in  which  no 
line 23508=>opening could be seen. 
line 23509=>     Frodo peering  forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching:  
line 23510=>like  great pinnacles or pillars  of stone  they seemed.  Tall and sheer and 
line 23511=>ominous they stood upon either  side of the  stream. A  narrow  gap appeared 
line 23512=>between them, and the River swept the boats towards it. 
line 23513=>     `Behold the Argonath, the Pillars  of  the Kings! ' cried  Aragorn. `We 
line 23514=>shall pass them soon. Keep the boats  in  line, and as far apart as you can!  
line 23515=>Hold the middle of the stream! ' 
line 23516=>     As Frodo was  borne towards them the great  pillars rose like towers to 
line 23517=>meet  him.  Giants  they  seemed  to  him,  vast  grey  figures  silent  but 
line 23518=>threatening. Then  he saw that they were  indeed shaped and  fashioned:  the 
line 23519=>craft and power  of  old had  wrought  upon them,  and  still they preserved 
line 23520=>through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which 
line 23521=>they  had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded  in the deep  waters stood 
line 23522=>two great kings  of stone: still with blurred eyes and  crannied  brows they 
line 23523=>frowned upon  the North. The left hand of each  was raised  palm outwards in 
line 23524=>gesture of  warning;  in each  right  hand there  was an axe; upon each head 
line 23525=>there  was a crumbling helm  and crown. Great  power and majesty they  still 
line 23526=>
line 23527=>####-wore, the silent wardens  of a long-vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon 
line 23528=>Frodo,  and he  cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as 
line 23529=>the boat drew  near. Even Boromir bowed  his head  as  the boats whirled by. 
line 23530=>frail and  fleeting  as little  leaves,  under  the  enduring  shadow of the 
line 23531=>sentinels of N®menor. So they passed into the dark chasm of the Gates. 
line 23532=>     Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side. Far 
line 23533=>off was the dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed 
line 23534=>over them.  Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front  muttering and 
line 23535=>groaning: `What a place! What a horrible place! Just let me get out of  this 
line 23536=>boat, and I'll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river! ' 
line 23537=>     `Fear  not! ' said a  strange voice behind him.  Frodo  turned and  saw 
line 23538=>Strider, and  yet  not Strider; for  the  weatherworn Ranger  was  no longer  
line 23539=>there.  In the  stern  sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud and erect, guiding 
line 23540=>the boat with skilful strokes; his hood was cast back, and his dark hair was 
line 23541=>blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes:  a king returning from exile to 
line 23542=>his own land. 
line 23543=>     'Fear not!  ' he said. `Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses 
line 23544=>of  Isildur and Anbrion, my sires of old.  Under  their shadow  Elessar, the 
line 23545=>Elfstone son of  Arathorn of the House  of  Valandil  Isildur's  son heir of 
line 23546=>Elendil, has nought to dread! ' 
line 23547=>     Then the light of  his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: `Would that 
line 23548=>Gandalf were  here! How my  heart yearns  for Minas Anor and the walls of my 
line 23549=>own city! But whither now shall I go? ' 
line 23550=>     The  chasm was long and  dark,  and filled  with the noise of wind  and 
line 23551=>rushing water and echoing stone. It  bent somewhat  towards the west so that 
line 23552=>at first all was dark  ahead; but soon Frodo  saw a tall gap of light before 
line 23553=>him,  ever  growing.  Swiftly it  drew  near,  and  suddenly the  boats shot 
line 23554=>through, out into a wide clear light. 
line 23555=>     The sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. 
line 23556=>The pent  waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale  Nen Hithoel, fenced 
line 23557=>by  steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but  their heads were 
line 23558=>bare,  cold-gleaming in  the sunlight. At  the far  southern end  rose three 
line 23559=>peaks.  The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered 
line 23560=>from 
line 23561=>them, an island  in the waters,  about  which   the flowing River  flung pale 
line 23562=>shimmering arms. Distant but deep there came up on the wind a  roaring sound 
line 23563=>like the roll of thunder heard far away. 
line 23564=>
line 23565=>####-     `Behold Tol Brandir! ' said Aragorn,  pointing south to  the tall peak. 
line 23566=>'Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of 
line 23567=>Hearing and of Sight. In the days  of the  great kings there were high seats 
line 23568=>upon  them, and watch was kept there. But it is said that no foot of  man or 
line 23569=>beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere  the shade of  night  falls we 
line 23570=>shall come to them. I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling.' 
line 23571=>     The Company rested now for a while,  drifting south on the current that 
line 23572=>flowed through the middle  of  the lake. They  ate  some food, and then they 
line 23573=>took  to their paddles and  hastened on their way. The sides of the westward 
line 23574=>hills fell into shadow, and  the Sun  grew round and  red.  Here and there a  
line 23575=>misty  star peered out. The three peaks loomed before  them, darkling in the 
line 23576=>twilight. Rauros was roaring with a grea t voice.  Already  night was laid on 
line 23577=>the flowing waters when the travellers came at  last under the shadow of the 
line 23578=>hills. 
line 23579=>     The tenth  day of their journey  was over.  Wilderland was behind them. 
line 23580=>They could go no further without choice between the  east -way and  the west. 
line 23581=>The last stage of the Quest was before them. 
line 23582=> 
line 23583=>
line 23584=>####- 
line 23585=>
line 23586=>Chapter 10. The Breaking of the Fellowship 
line 23587=>
line 23588=> 
line 23589=> 
line 23590=>     Aragorn led them to  the right  arm of the River. Here upon its western 
line 23591=>side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from 
line 23592=>the feet of Amon Hen.  Behind it rose the first gentle  slopes  of  the hill 
line 23593=>clad with trees, and trees marched away westward along the curving shores of 
line 23594=>the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass.  
line 23595=>     'Here  we will rest tonight,' said Aragorn. `This is the lawn  of Parth 
line 23596=>Galen: a fair place in the summer days of old. Let us hope  that no evil has 
line 23597=>yet come here.' 
line 23598=>     They drew up their boats on the green banks, and  beside them they made  
line 23599=>their camp.  They set  a watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies.  
line 23600=>If Gollum had contrived  to follow  them,  he  remained  unseen and unheard. 
line 23601=>Nonetheless as the night  wore on Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in  his 
line 23602=>sleep and waking. In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn 
line 23603=>it was to watch. 
line 23604=>     `Why are you waking? ' asked Frodo. `It is not your watch.' 
line 23605=>     `I do  not know,' answered Aragorn; `but a shadow and a threat has been 
line 23606=>growing in my sleep. It would be well to draw your sword.' 
line 23607=>     `Why? ' said Frodo. `Are enemies at hand? ' 
line 23608=>     `Let us see what Sting may show,' answered Aragorn. 
line 23609=>     Frodo  then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges 
line 23610=>gleamed  dimly in  the night. `Orcs! ' he said. `Not very  near, and yet too 
line 23611=>near, it seems.' 
line 23612=>     `I feared as much,' said Aragorn. `But maybe they are  not on this side 
line 23613=>of the River. The light of  Sting is faint, and it may point to no more than 
line 23614=>spies of Mordor  roaming on the  slopes  of  Amon  Lhaw.  I have never heard 
line 23615=>before of Orcs  upon Amon Hen. Yet who  knows what may happen in  these 
line 23616=>evil 
line 23617=>days, now  that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages of  Anduin.  
line 23618=>We must go warily tomorrow.' 
line 23619=>     The day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars 
line 23620=>of cloud  like the fumes of a great burning. The  rising  sun  lit them from 
line 23621=>beneath  with flames of  murky red; but  soon  it climbed above  them into a  
line 23622=>clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir was tipped with  gold. Frodo looked out 
line 23623=>
line 23624=>####-eastward and  gazed at the tall island.  Its  si des  sprang sheer out of the 
line 23625=>running  water. High up above the  tall cliffs were  steep slopes upon which 
line 23626=>trees climbed, mounting  one  head above another; and  above them again were 
line 23627=>grey  faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by  a great spire  of  stone. Many 
line 23628=>birds were  circling  about it, but no sign of  other living things could be 
line 23629=>seen. 
line 23630=>     When they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. `The  day has 
line 23631=>come at last,' he said: 'the day of choice which we have  long delayed. What 
line 23632=>shall  now become  of our Company that has  travelled  so far in fellowship?  
line 23633=>Shall we turn  west with  Boromir and go to the wars of Gondor; or turn east  
line 23634=>to the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and 
line 23635=>that as each may choose? Whatever  we do  must  be done soon. We  cannot 
line 23636=>long 
line 23637=>halt here. The  enemy is on the eastern shore, we know; but I  fear that the 
line 23638=>Orcs may already be on this side of the water.' 
line 23639=>     There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved. 
line 23640=>     'Well,  Frodo,'  said Aragorn at last. `I fear that  the burden is laid 
line 23641=>upon  you. You are the  Bearer  appointed by the  Council. Your  own way you  
line 23642=>alone  can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, and 
line 23643=>though I have tried to  bear his part, I do not know what design or hope  he 
line 23644=>had  for this hour,  if indeed he had any. Most  likely it seems that if  he 
line 23645=>were here now the choice would still wait on you. Such is your fate.' 
line 23646=>     Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. `I  know that haste 
line 23647=>is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden is heavy. Give me an hour longer, 
line 23648=>and I will speak. Let me be alone! ' 
line 23649=>     Aragorn looked  at  him with  kindly  pity. `Very  well,  Frodo  son of 
line 23650=>Drogo,' he  said. `You shall have an hour, and  you  shall be alone. We will 
line 23651=>stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.' 
line 23652=>     Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had  been watching 
line 23653=>his master with  great  concern, shook his  head and  muttered:  'Plain as a  
line 23654=>pikestaff it is, but it's no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.' 
line 23655=>, 
line 23656=>     Presently Frodo  got  up and  walked away;  and Sam saw that  while the  
line 23657=>others restrained  themselves and did not stare at him,  the eyes of Boromir 
line 23658=>followed Frodo  intently, until he passed  out of sight in the  trees at the 
line 23659=>foot of Amon Hen. 
line 23660=>     Wandering  aimlessly at first in the  wood, Frodo found  that his  feet 
line 23661=>
line 23662=>####-were leading  him up towards the  slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the 
line 23663=>dwindling ruins of a  road of long  ago. In steep places stairs of stone had 
line 23664=>been hewn,  but now they were  cracked  and worn, and split by the  roots of 
line 23665=>trees.  For some while he climbed, not caring which  way  he  went, until he 
line 23666=>came  to a  grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about it, and  in the midst was a  
line 23667=>wide  flat stone.  The  little upland lawn  was  open upon the  East and was 
line 23668=>filled now with  the early  sunlight. Frodo halted  and looked  out over the 
line 23669=>River, far  below  him, to Tol  Brandir and the birds wheeling in the  great 
line 23670=>gulf of air between  him and the untrodden isle.  The voice of Rauros was  a  
line 23671=>mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom. 
line 23672=>     He  sat  down upon the stone  and cupped his chin in his hands, staring 
line 23673=>eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since Bilbo 
line 23674=>left the Shire was passing through his mind,  and he  recalled and  pondered  
line 23675=>everything  that he could  remember  of Gandalf's words.  Time went on,  and 
line 23676=>still he was no nearer to a choice. 
line 23677=>     Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that 
line 23678=>something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were upon  him. He sprang  up 
line 23679=>and turned; but all that  he saw to his  surprise was Boromir, and his  face 
line 23680=>was smiling and kind. 
line 23681=>     `I was afraid for  you, Frodo,' he said, coming forward. `If Aragorn is 
line 23682=>right and Orcs are near,  then none of us should wander alone, and you least  
line 23683=>of all: so much depends on you. And my heart too  is heavy. May  I  stay now 
line 23684=>and talk for a  while,  since  I have found  you? It would comfort me. Where 
line 23685=>there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together  
line 23686=>may perhaps find wisdom.' 
line 23687=>     `You are kind,'  answered Frodo. 'But  I do not think  that  any speech 
line 23688=>will help me.  For  I know what I should do, but I  am  afraid of doing  it, 
line 23689=>Boromir: afraid.' 
line 23690=>     Boromir stood  silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in 
line 23691=>the branches of the trees. Frodo shivered. 
line 23692=>     Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. `Are you sure that you do not 
line 23693=>suffer needlessly? ' he said. `I wish to help you. You need counsel in  your 
line 23694=>hard choice. Will you not take mine? ' 
line 23695=>     'I  think I know already  what counsel you would  give, Boromir,'  said 
line 23696=>Frodo. 'And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.' 
line 23697=>     `Warning? Warning against what? ' said Boromir sharply. 
line 23698=>     'Against  delay. Against the  way that seems easier. Against refusal of 
line 23699=>
line 23700=>####-the  burden  that  is laid on me. Against -well,  if it must be said, against  
line 23701=>trust in the strength and truth of Men.' 
line 23702=>     `Yet that  strength has  long  protected you far  away  in  your little 
line 23703=>country, though you knew it not.' 
line 23704=>     'I do not doubt the valour of  your  people. But the world is changing. 
line 23705=>The  walls of Minas Tirith may be strong, but they are not strong enough. If 
line 23706=>they fail, what then? ' 
line 23707=>     'We shall fall in battle valiantly.  Yet there is still hope  that they 
line 23708=>will not fail.' 
line 23709=>     'No hope while the Ring lasts,' said Frodo. 
line 23710=>     'Ah! The Ring! '  said Boromir, his eyes lighting. 'The Ring! Is it not 
line 23711=>a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt  for so  small a  
line 23712=>thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an instant in the House 
line 23713=>of Elrond. Could I not have a sight of it again? ' 
line 23714=>     Frodo looked  up. His heart went suddenly cold.  He caught the  strange 
line 23715=>gleam in  Boromir's eyes, yet his face was still kind  and friendly.  'It is 
line 23716=>best that it should lie hidden,' he answered. 
line 23717=>     'As you wish. I care  not,' said Boromir.  'Yet may I not even speak of 
line 23718=>it? For you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands  of the Enemy:  
line 23719=>of  its evil  uses not  of its good.  The  world is changing, you say. Minas 
line 23720=>Tirith will fall,  if the Ring lasts. But why?  Certainly, if the  Ring were 
line 23721=>with the Enemy. But why, if it were with us? ' 
line 23722=>     'Were you not at the Council?  ' answered Frodo. `Because we cannot use  
line 23723=>it, and what is done with it turns to evil.' 
line 23724=>     Boromir got up and walked about impatiently. 'So you go  on,' he cried. 
line 23725=>'Gandalf, Elrond -- all these folk have taught you to say so. For themselves 
line 23726=>they may be right. These  elves and half-elves and  wizards, they would come 
line 23727=>to grief perhaps.  Yet often I  doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. 
line 23728=>But each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they  will  not be corrupted. We 
line 23729=>of Minas Tirith have been  staunch  through long years  of trial. We do  not 
line 23730=>desire  the  power  of  wizard-lords,  only  strength  to  defend ourselves, 
line 23731=>strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the 
line 23732=>-Ring of Power. It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad 
line 23733=>not to use it, to  use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the 
line 23734=>ruthless, these alone will  achieve victory.  What could not a warrior do in 
line 23735=>this  hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn do? Or if he refuses, why 
line 23736=>
line 23737=>####-not Boromir? The Ring would give  me power of Command. How I would 
line 23738=>drive the 
line 23739=>hosts of Mordor, and all men would flock to my banner!' 
line 23740=>     Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed 
line 23741=>to have forgotten Frodo, while  his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the 
line 23742=>mustering  of  men;  and he drew  plans  for  great alliances  and  glorious 
line 23743=>victories to be; and he cast down Mordor, and became himself  a mighty king, 
line 23744=>benevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms.  
line 23745=>     'And  they tell  us to throw it away!' he cried. `I do not sa y  destroy 
line 23746=>it. That might be  well, if  reason could show any hope of doing so. It does 
line 23747=>not. The only  plan that  is proposed  to us  is that a halfling should walk  
line 23748=>blindly into  Mordor and offer  the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for  
line 23749=>himself. Folly! 
line 23750=>     'Surely you see it, my friend?' he said, turning  now suddenly to Frodo 
line 23751=>again. `You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should  pardon 
line 23752=>you. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?' 
line 23753=>     'No, I am afraid,' said Frodo.  'Simply  afraid. But I am glad  to have 
line 23754=>heard you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.' 
line 23755=>     `Then  you  will come to  Minas Tirith? ' cried Boromir.  His eyes were 
line 23756=>shining and his face eager. 
line 23757=>     `You misunderstand me,' said Frodo. 
line 23758=>     'But you will come, at least for a while? ' Boromir persisted. 'My city 
line 23759=>is not far  now;  and it is little further  from  there to  Mordor than from 
line 23760=>here.  We have  been long in the  wilderness, and you need  news of what the 
line 23761=>Enemy is doing  before you make a move. Come with me, Frodo,' he  said. 
line 23762=>`You 
line 23763=>need  rest before your venture. if  go you must.' He laid  his  hand on  the 
line 23764=>hobbit's  shoulder in friendly fashion;  but Frodo  felt  the hand trembling 
line 23765=>with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed with alarm the 
line 23766=>tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength. 
line 23767=>     `Why are you  so unfriendly? '  said Boromir. `I am a true man, neither  
line 23768=>thief nor tracker. I  need your Ring: that you know now; but  I give  you my  
line 23769=>word  that I do not  desire to keep it.  Will you not at least  let me  make 
line 23770=>trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring! ' 
line 23771=>     `No! no! ' cried Frodo. 'The Council laid it upon me to bear it.' 
line 23772=>     `It is by our own folly that the Enemy will  defeat us,' cried Boromir. 
line 23773=>`How it  angers  me!   Fool!  Obstinate fool!  Running wilfully to  death and 
line 23774=>
line 23775=>####-ruining our cause.  If any mortals have claim  to the Ring, it is the men of 
line 23776=>N®menor, and not Halflings. It is not yours save by unhappy chance. It might 
line 23777=>have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me!  ' 
line 23778=>     Frodo  did not answer, but moved away  till the great  flat stone stood 
line 23779=>between them. `Come, come, my friend! ' said Boromir in a softer voice. 'Why 
line 23780=>not get rid of it? Why not be free of your  doubt and  fear? You can lay the 
line 23781=>blame on me, if you  will.  You  can say that I was too strong and took it by 
line 23782=>force. For I am  too strong for you, halfling,' he cried;  and  suddenly  he 
line 23783=>sprang  over the stone  and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face  was 
line 23784=>hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes. 
line 23785=>     Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only 
line 23786=>one thing he could do: trembling  he pulled  out the Ring upon its chain and 
line 23787=>quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him  again.  The 
line 23788=>Man  gasped, stared for a  moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking 
line 23789=>here and there among the rocks and trees. 
line 23790=>     'Miserable trickster!' he shouted. `Let me  get my  hands on you! Now I 
line 23791=>see your mind. You  will take the Ring  to Sauron and  sell us all. You have 
line 23792=>only waited  your  chance to  leave  us  in  the  lurch. Curse  you and  all 
line 23793=>halflings to death  and darkness! ' Then, catching his foot on  a stone,  he 
line 23794=>fell sprawling and  lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his 
line 23795=>own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he wept. 
line 23796=>     He rose and  passed  his  hand  over his eyes, dashing away  the tears.  
line 23797=>'What have I said? ' he cried. `What have I done? Frodo, Frodo! ' he called.  
line 23798=>'Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back! ' 
line 23799=>     There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was  already 
line 23800=>far  away, leaping  blindly up  the path to the hill -top. Terror  and  grief 
line 23801=>shook  him, seeing in  his thought the  mad fierce face of Boromir,  and his 
line 23802=>burning eyes. 
line 23803=>     Soon  he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted,  gasping 
line 23804=>for breath. He saw as through a mist a  wide  flat circle, paved with mighty 
line 23805=>flags, and surrounded with  a crumbling battlement;  and in the middle,  set 
line 23806=>upon four carven pillars, was a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. 
line 23807=>Up  he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like  a lost  child that 
line 23808=>had clambered upon the throne of mountain-kings.  
line 23809=>     At first he could see little. He seemed  to be in a  world of  mist  in 
line 23810=>which  there were only shadows: the Ring  was upon him.  Then here and there 
line 23811=>the mist gave way and he saw  many visions: small and clear as if they  were 
line 23812=>
line 23813=>####-under his eyes upon a table, and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright 
line 23814=>living images.  The world  seemed to have shrunk  and  fallen silent. He was 
line 23815=>sitting upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men 
line 23816=>of  N®menor. Eastward he looked into  wide uncharted lands, nameless plains,  
line 23817=>and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great  River lay like a 
line 23818=>ribbon beneath him, and the  Misty Mountains stood small and hard  as broken 
line 23819=>teeth. Westward he looked and saw  the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, 
line 23820=>the pinnacle of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below 
line 23821=>his very feet the  Great River curled  like a toppling wave and plunged over 
line 23822=>the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the 
line 23823=>fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw, the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of 
line 23824=>sea -birds whirling like a white dust  in the  sun, and  beneath them a green 
line 23825=>and silver sea, rippling in endless lines.  
line 23826=>     But everywhere he looked he saw  the signs of  war. The Misty Mountains 
line 23827=>were  crawling  like anthills:  orcs were  issuing out  of a thousand holes.  
line 23828=>Under the  boughs of  Mirkwood there was  deadly strife of Elves and Men and 
line 23829=>fell  beasts. The  land of the Beornings was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; 
line 23830=>smoke rose on the borders of Lurien. 
line 23831=>     Horsemen  were  galloping on  the grass of  Rohan;  wolves poured  from  
line 23832=>Isengard. From the  havens of Harad ships of war  put out to sea; and out of 
line 23833=>the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon 
line 23834=>horses, 
line 23835=>chariots of chieftains  and laden wains. All  the power of the Dark Lord was 
line 23836=>in  motion. Then turning south  again  he  beheld Minas Tirith. Far away  it 
line 23837=>seemed. and beautiful: white-walled,  many-towered, proud  and fair upon its 
line 23838=>mountain-seat;  its battlements  glittered with  steel, and its turrets were 
line 23839=>bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas Tirith 
line 23840=>was  set  another  fortress,  greater and more  strong.  Thither,  eastward, 
line 23841=>unwilling his eye was drawn.  It passed the ruined bridges of Osgiliath, the 
line 23842=>grinning  gates of  Minas Morgul. and the  haunted Mountains, and it  looked 
line 23843=>upon Gorgoroth,  the  valley of terror  in the  Land  of Mordor. Darkness lay 
line 23844=>there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, 
line 23845=>and 
line 23846=>a  great  reek  rising.  Then at last  his  gaze was held: wall  upon  wall, 
line 23847=>battlement  upon  battlement, black, immeasurably strong,  mountain of iron, 
line 23848=>gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw  it: Barad-dyr,  Fortress of Sauron. 
line 23849=>All hope left him. 
line 23850=>
line 23851=>####-     And suddenly he felt the  Eye. There was an eye  in the Dark Tower that 
line 23852=>did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his gaze.  A fierce eager  
line 23853=>will  was there.  It leaped  towards him; almost  like a finger he  felt it, 
line 23854=>searching for him. Very soon it would nail him down, know just exactly where 
line 23855=>he was. Amon  Lhaw it touched. It glanced  upon Tol Brandir he threw himself 
line 23856=>from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood. 
line 23857=>     He heard himself crying out: Never, never! Or was it: Verily I  come, I 
line 23858=>come to  you? He could not tell. Then  as a flash  from some other point  of 
line 23859=>power there  came  to  his mind another thought: Take it off!  Take  it off! 
line 23860=>Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring! 
line 23861=>     The two powers strove in him. For a moment,  perfectly balanced between 
line 23862=>their piercing  points,  he  writhed,  tormented. Suddenly  he was aware  of 
line 23863=>himself  again. Frodo, neither  the  Voice nor the Eye: free to choose,  and 
line 23864=>with  one  remaining  instant in  which to  do so. He  took the Ring off his 
line 23865=>finger. He  was kneeling in clear  sunlight before  the  high  seat. A black  
line 23866=>shadow seemed to  pass like an arm above him; it  missed Amon Hen and 
line 23867=>groped 
line 23868=>out west,  and faded. Then all the sky was  clean and blue and birds sang in 
line 23869=>every tree. 
line 23870=>     Frodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him,  but his will was 
line 23871=>firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. `I  will do now what I 
line 23872=>must,' he said.  'This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at 
line 23873=>work even in the Company,  and the Ring must leave them before it  does more 
line 23874=>harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot  trust, and  those I  can trust are too 
line 23875=>dear  to me: poor old  Sam,  and Merry and  Pippin. Strider,  too: his heart 
line 23876=>yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed there, now Boromir has fallen 
line 23877=>into evil. I will go alone. At once.' 
line 23878=>     He went quickly  down the path and came back to the lawn where  Boromir 
line 23879=>had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought he could hear cries and  
line 23880=>calls from the woods near the shore below.  
line 23881=>     'They'll be hunting  for  me,' he  said. `I wonder how long I have been 
line 23882=>away. Hours, I should think.' He hesitated. 'What can  I  do? ' he muttered. 
line 23883=>'I must go now or I shall never go.  I shan't  get  a  chance  again. I hate 
line 23884=>leaving them, and like  this without  any explanation. But surely  they will 
line 23885=>understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?' 
line 23886=>     Slowly he  drew out the Ring and put it  on  once more. He vanished and  
line 23887=>passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind. 
line 23888=>
line 23889=>####-     The others remained long by the river -side. For some time they had been 
line 23890=>silent, moving restlessly about; but now they  were sitting in a circle, and 
line 23891=>they  were talking. Every now  and again they made efforts to speak of other  
line 23892=>things,  of  their  long road and many  adventures;  they questioned Aragorn 
line 23893=>concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient  history, and the remnants of 
line 23894=>its great works that could still be seen in this strange border -land  of the 
line 23895=>Emyn  Muil: the stone kings and  the  seats of Lhaw and Hen, and  the  great 
line 23896=>Stair  beside  the falls  of  Rauros. But always  their  thoughts  and words 
line 23897=>strayed back to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose  to do? Why  
line 23898=>was 
line 23899=>he hesitating?  
line 23900=>     `He is  debating  which course  is  the most desperate, I think,'  said 
line 23901=>Aragorn. 'And well he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the Company 
line 23902=>to  go east, since we have  been tracked by Gollum,  and  must fear that the 
line 23903=>secret of our journey is already betrayed.  But Minas Tirith is no nearer to 
line 23904=>the Fire and the destruction of the Burden. 
line 23905=>     `We may remain there for a while  and make  a brave stand; but the Lord 
line 23906=>Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even Elrond  said was beyond 
line 23907=>his power: either to keep the Burden  secret. or to hold  off the full might 
line 23908=>of the Enemy when he comes  to take it.  Which way would any of us choose in 
line 23909=>Frodo's place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.' 
line 23910=>     'Grievous is our loss,'  said Legolas.  'Yet we must needs make up  our 
line 23911=>minds without his aid.  Why cannot we decide, and so help Frodo? Let us call 
line 23912=>him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.' 
line 23913=>     `And so should I,'  said Gimli. 'We, of course, were only sent  to help 
line 23914=>the  Bearer along the  road, to go no further than we wished; and none of us 
line 23915=>is under any oath or  command to  seek Mount Doom.  Hard was my parting 
line 23916=>from 
line 23917=>Lothlurien. Yet I have come so far, and I say this: now we  have reached the 
line 23918=>last  choice, it  is clear to  me that I  cannot leave Frodo. I would choose 
line 23919=>Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.' 
line 23920=>     `And I  too will go with him,' said Legolas. `It would be faithless now 
line 23921=>to say farewell.' 
line 23922=>     'It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,' said Aragorn. 'But 
line 23923=>if  he goes east,  then all need not go  with him; nor  do I think that  all 
line 23924=>should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, 
line 23925=>or  one alone.  If  you  would let me choose,  then  I should  appoint three 
line 23926=>
line 23927=>####-companions:  Sam, who  could not  bear it otherwise; and  Gimli; and myself.  
line 23928=>Boromir  will return to his own city,  where his father and his  people need 
line 23929=>him; and with him the others should go, or at  least Meriadoc  and Peregrin , 
line 23930=>if Legolas is not willing to leave us.' 
line 23931=>     `That won't do at all! ' cried Merry. 'We can't leave Frodo! Pippin and 
line 23932=>I  always intended to go wherever he went,  and we still  do. But we did not 
line 23933=>realize what that would mean. It  seemed different so far away, in the Shire 
line 23934=>or in Rivendell. It  would  be mad and cruel to let Frodo go  to Mordor. Why  
line 23935=>can't we stop him?' 
line 23936=>     'We must stop  him,'  said Pippin.  `And  that is what  he  is worrying 
line 23937=>about, I am sure. He knows we shan't agree to his going east. And  he doesn't  
line 23938=>like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to 
line 23939=>Mordor  alone! ' Pippin shuddered. 'But the dear silly  old hobbit, he ought 
line 23940=>to know that he  hasn't got to ask.  He ought  to know that if we can't stop 
line 23941=>him, we shan't leave him.' 
line 23942=>     'Begging  your  pardon,'  said  Sam. 'I don't  think you understand  my 
line 23943=>master  at all.  He isn't hesitating about which way  to  go. Of course not! 
line 23944=>What's the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your 
line 23945=>pardon, 
line 23946=>Master Boromir,' he added, and turned. It was then that they discovered that 
line 23947=>Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on  the outside of the circle, 
line 23948=>was no longer there. 
line 23949=>     `Now where's he got to? ' cried Sam, looking worried.  'He's been a bit 
line 23950=>queer lately, to my mind. But anyway he's  not in this business. He's off to 
line 23951=>his  home, as he always said;  and no blame to  him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows 
line 23952=>he's got to find the Cracks of Doom,  if  he can. But he's  afraid . Now it's 
line 23953=>come to the point, he's just plain terrified. That's what his trouble is. Of 
line 23954=>course  he's had  a bit of schooling, so to speak-we  all have-since we left 
line 23955=>home, or  he'd be so terrified he'd just  fling  the Ring in the  River  and 
line 23956=>bolt. But he's still too frightened to start. And he isn't worrying about us 
line 23957=>either: whether we'll  go along with him or no. He knows we mean to.  That's 
line 23958=>another thing that's  bothering  him. If  he  screws himself up to go, he'll 
line 23959=>want to go alone. Mark my words!  We're going to  have trouble when he 
line 23960=>comes 
line 23961=>back. For he'll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name's Baggins.' 
line 23962=>     'I believe  you speak more  wisely than any of us,  Sam,' said Aragorn. 
line 23963=>`And what shall we do, if you prove right? ' 
line 23964=>
line 23965=>####-     'Stop him! Don't let him go! ' cried Pippin. 
line 23966=>     'I wonder?  '  said Aragorn.  `He is  the Bearer, and  the fate  of the 
line 23967=>Burden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to drive him one way or 
line 23968=>the  other. Nor  do I  think that we  should succeed, if we tried. There are 
line 23969=>other powers at work far stronger.' 
line 23970=>     `Well, I wish  Frodo would "screw himself up" and come back. and let us 
line 23971=>get it over,' said Pippin. `This waiting is horrible! Surely the time is up?  
line 23972=>' 
line 23973=>     `Yes,' said Aragorn. 'The hour  is long passed. The morning is  wearing 
line 23974=>away. We must call for him.' 
line 23975=>     At  that  moment Boromir  reappeared.  He  came out from the  trees and 
line 23976=>walked  towards them  without speaking.  His  face  looked grim and sad.  He 
line 23977=>paused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with 
line 23978=>his eyes on the ground. 
line 23979=>     `Where have you been, Boromir? ' asked Aragorn. `Have you seen Frodo? ' 
line 23980=>     Boromir hesitated for  a second.  `Yes,  and no,'  he  answered slowly. 
line 23981=>`Yes: I found him some way up the hill,  and I spoke to  him. I urged him to  
line 23982=>come to  Minas Tirith and  not to go  east. I grew angry and he  left me. He 
line 23983=>vanished. I have  never seen such a thing happen before. though I have heard 
line 23984=>of it in tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not  find him again. I 
line 23985=>thought he would return to you.' 
line 23986=>     'Is that all that you have to say? ' said Aragorn, looking hard and not 
line 23987=>too kindly at Boromir. 
line 23988=>     `Yes,' he answered. `I will say no more yet.' 
line 23989=>     `This is  bad!' cried Sam, jumping up. `I don't know  what this Man has 
line 23990=>been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put  the thing on? He didn't ought to have; 
line 23991=>and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!' 
line 23992=>     'But he wouldn't keep it on`' said Merry. `Not when he had  escaped the 
line 23993=>unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.' 
line 23994=>     `But where did he go? Where is he? ' cried Pippin. 'He's been away ages 
line 23995=>now.' 
line 23996=>     `How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir? ' asked Aragorn. 
line 23997=>     `Half  an hour, maybe,' he answered.  `Or it  might be an hour. I  have 
line 23998=>wandered for  some time since.  I do not  know! I do not know! ' He  put his 
line 23999=>head in his hands, and sat as if bowed with grief.  
line 24000=>     `An hour since he vanished! ' shouted Sam. `We must try and find him at 
line 24001=>once. Come on! ' 
line 24002=>
line 24003=>####-     `Wait  a moment!  ' cried Aragorn. `We must  divide up into pairs,  and 
line 24004=>arrange-here, hold on! Wait! ' 
line 24005=>     It was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed  off  first. 
line 24006=>Merry  and Pippin  had followed, and were already disappearing westward into 
line 24007=>the trees  by  the  shore,  shouting:  Frodo! Frodo!  in  their clear,  high 
line 24008=>hobbit-voices. Legolas and  Gimli were running.  A  sudden  panic or madness 
line 24009=>seemed to have fallen on the Company. 
line 24010=>     `We  shall all be scattered and lost,' groaned Aragorn. `Boromir!  I do 
line 24011=>not know what part you have played in this mischief, but help  now! Go after 
line 24012=>those  two  young hobbits,  and guard them at  the least, even if you cannot 
line 24013=>find Frodo. Come back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I 
line 24014=>shall return soon.' 
line 24015=>     Aragorn  sprang swiftly away and  went in pursuit of  Sam. Just  as  he 
line 24016=>reached the  little lawn among the rowans  he  overtook him, toiling uphill, 
line 24017=>panting and calling, Frodo! 
line 24018=>     `Come with me, Sam! '  he said.  `None of us should be alone.  There is 
line 24019=>mischief about. I feel it.  I am going to the top, to  the Seat of Amon Hen, 
line 24020=>to  see what may be   seen. And look! It is  as  my heart guessed, Frodo went  
line 24021=>this way. Follow me, and keep your eyes open! ' He sped up the path. 
line 24022=>     Sam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and 
line 24023=>soon fell behind. He had not gone far before Aragorn was out of sight ahead. 
line 24024=>Sam stopped and puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head. 
line 24025=>     `Whoa,  Sam  Gamgee! ' he said aloud. `Your legs are too short, so  use 
line 24026=>your head! Let me  see now! Boromir isn't lying, that's not  his way; but he 
line 24027=>hasn't  told  us everything. Something scared Mr.  Frodo  badly.  He screwed 
line 24028=>himself up  to the point,  sudden. He made up his mind  at last to go. Where 
line 24029=>to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That's hard, cruel 
line 24030=>hard.' 
line 24031=>     Sam passed his hand over  his eyes, brushing  away the  tears. 'Steady, 
line 24032=>Gamgee!  ' he said. `Think,  if you can!  He can't fly across rivers, and he 
line 24033=>can't  jump  waterfalls. He's got no gear. So he's  got  to get back to  the 
line 24034=>boats. Back to the boats! Back to the boats, Sam, like lightning!  ' 
line 24035=>     Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up 
line 24036=>he  got and ran on.  He  came to the edge of the lawn of Parth Galen  by the 
line 24037=>shore, where the boats were  drawn up out  of the  water.  No one was there.  
line 24038=>There  seemed to be cries in  the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He 
line 24039=>stood gazing for a moment. stock -still, gaping.  A boat was sliding down the 
line 24040=>
line 24041=>####-bank  all by itself.  With  a shout Sam raced  across  the  grass. The  boat 
line 24042=>slipped into the wat 
line 24043=> 
line 24044=>128d 
line 24045=> 
line 24046=>er. 
line 24047=>     `Coming, Mr. Frodo!  Coming! ' called  Sam, and flung himself  from the 
line 24048=>bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by a  yard. With  a  cry 
line 24049=>and a  splash he fell face  downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went 
line 24050=>under, and the River closed over his curly head. 
line 24051=>     An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and 
line 24052=>the boat put about. Frodo was  just  in time to grasp Sam by  the hair as he 
line 24053=>came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes.  
line 24054=>     `Up you come, Sam my lad! ' said Frodo. `Now take my hand! ' 
line 24055=>     `Save me, Mr. Frodo! ' gasped Sam.  `I'm  drownded.  I can't  see  your 
line 24056=>hand.' 
line 24057=>     `Here it is. Don't  pinch, lad! I  won't  let you  go. Tread water  and 
line 24058=>don't flounder, or  you'll upset the boat. There now, get hold of  the side, 
line 24059=>and let me use the paddle! ' 
line 24060=>     With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank. and Sam was 
line 24061=>able to scramble out, wet  as a  water -rat.  Frodo  took off  the  Ring  and 
line 24062=>stepped ashore again. 
line 24063=>     `Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam! ' he said. 
line 24064=>     'Oh, Mr. Frodo, that's hard! ' said Sam shivering. `That's hard, trying 
line 24065=>to  go without me and all. If I hadn't a guessed right, where  would you  be 
line 24066=>now?  ' 
line 24067=>     `Safely on my way.' 
line 24068=>     `Safely! ' said Sam. `All alone and without me to help you? I  couldn't  
line 24069=>have a borne it, it'd have been the death of me.' 
line 24070=>     'It would be the death of you to come  with me, Sam,' said  Frodo and I 
line 24071=>could not have borne that.' 
line 24072=>     `Not as certain as being left behind,' said Sam. 
line 24073=>     `But I am going to Mordor.' 
line 24074=>     `I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course  you are. And I'm coming 
line 24075=>with you.' 
line 24076=>     `Now, Sam,'  said Frodo, `don't  hinder me!  The  others will be coming 
line 24077=>back  at any  minute.  If  they  ca tch me here. I  shall have  to argue  and 
line 24078=>
line 24079=>####-explain, and I shall never have  the heart  or  the chance to get off. But I 
line 24080=>must go at once. It's the only way.' 
line 24081=>     `Of course  it is,' answered  Sam.  'But not alone. I'm  coming too, or  
line 24082=>neither of us isn't going. I'll knock holes in all the boats first.' 
line 24083=>     Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. 
line 24084=>`Leave one! 'he said. `We'll need it. But you  can't come like  this without 
line 24085=>your gear or food or anything.' 
line 24086=>     'Just  hold on a moment, and  I'll  get my stuff!' cried  Sam  eagerly. 
line 24087=>'It's all ready. I thought we should be off today.' He rushed to the camping 
line 24088=>place,  fished out  his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it  when  he 
line 24089=>emptied the boat of his companions' goods grabbed a  spare blanket, and some 
line 24090=>extra packages of food, and ran back. 
line 24091=>     `So all my  plan is spoilt!  ' said Frodo.  `It is  no good  trying  to 
line 24092=>escape you. But I'm glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is 
line 24093=>plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find 
line 24094=>a safe road! Strider will look after them. I don't suppose we shall see them 
line 24095=>again.' 
line 24096=>     `Yet we may, Mr Frodo. We may,' said Sam. 
line 24097=>     So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo 
line 24098=>paddled away from the shore, and the River  bore them swiftly away. down the 
line 24099=>western arm, and past  the frowning cliffs  of Tol  Brandir. The roar of the 
line 24100=>great falls drew nearer. Even with such help  as Sam could give, it was hard 
line 24101=>work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island and drive 
line 24102=>the boat eastward towards the far shore. 
line 24103=>     At  length  they  came to land  again  upon the southern slopes of Amon 
line 24104=>Lhaw. There  they found a shelving shore, and they  drew the  boat out, high 
line 24105=>above the water ,  and hid it as well  as  they could behind a great boulder. 
line 24106=>Then  shouldering their  burdens,  they set off, seeking a  path  that would  
line 24107=>bring them over  the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and  down into the Land of 
line 24108=>Shadow. 
line 24109=>  
line 24110=>
line 24111=>####-     
line 24112=>Here ends the first part of the history of the War of the Ring. 
line 24113=>     The second part is called THE TWO TOWERS, since the events recounted 
line 24114=>in it are dominated by ORTHANC,  the citadel  of  Saruman, and  the fortress 
line 24115=>of MINAS MORGUL  that guards the secret entrance  to Mordor;  it  tells  of 
line 24116=>the deeds and  perils of  all  the members of the now sundered fellowship, until 
line 24117=>the coming of the Great Darkness. 
line 24118=>     The  third part tells of the  last defence against the Shadow,  and the 
line 24119=>end of the mission of the Ring-bearer in  THE RETURN OF THE KING.

line 24127=> * BOOK III *  
line 24128=>
line 24129=>Chapter 1. The Departure of Boromir 
line 24130=>
line 24131=> 
line 24132=> 
line 24133=>     Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. 
line 24134=>Hobbits go light, and  their  footprints are not  easy  even for a Ranger to 
line 24135=>read, but not  far from the top a spring  crossed  the path, and in the  wet 
line 24136=>earth he saw what he was seeking. 
line 24137=>     'I read the  signs  aright,'  he  said  to himself. 'Frodo  ran  to the 
line 24138=>hill-top. I wonder what he  saw there? But he returned by  the same way, and 
line 24139=>went down the hill again.' 
line 24140=>     Aragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to 
line 24141=>see there something that  would guide him in his perplexities; but  time was 
line 24142=>pressing. Suddenly he leaped  forward, and  ran to the  summit,  across  the 
line 24143=>great flag-stones, and up the steps. Then sitting in the high seat he looked 
line 24144=>out. But the  sun seemed darkened,  and the world dim and remote.  He turned 
line 24145=>from the North back again to North, and saw nothing save  the distant hills,  
line 24146=>unless it were  that far away he could see again  a great bird like an eagle 
line 24147=>high in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth. 
line 24148=>     Even as he  gazed his  quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below,  
line 24149=>on the west  side  of the River. He stiffened.  There were  cries, and among 
line 24150=>them, to  his  horror, he  could distinguish the harsh voices of  Orcs. Then 
line 24151=>suddenly with  a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the  blasts of it 
line 24152=>smote the hills and  echoed  in the hollows, rising  in a mighty shout above 
line 24153=>the roaring of the falls. 
line 24154=>     'The horn of  Boromir!' he cried. 'He is  in need!' He  sprang down the 
line 24155=>steps and away, leaping down the path. 'Alas! An ill fate is on me this day, 
line 24156=>and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?' 
line 24157=>     As he ran the cries  came louder, but fainter  now and  desperately the 
line 24158=>horn was blowing. Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Orcs, and suddenly 
line 24159=>the horn-calls  ceased.  Aragorn  raced  down the last slope,  but before he 
line 24160=>could reach  the hill's foot, the sounds died away;  and as he turned to the 
line 24161=>left and ran towards them  they  retreated, until at last he could hear them 
line 24162=>no more. Drawing  his bright sword and crying Elendil!  Elendil!  he crashed 
line 24163=>through the trees.  
line 24164=>
line 24165=>####-     A mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake 
line 24166=>he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was 
line 24167=>resting.  But  Aragorn saw  that he was pierced  with  many  black -feathered 
line 24168=>arrows; his sword  was still in his hand, but it  was  broken near the hilt; 
line 24169=>his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Orcs lay slain, piled all about 
line 24170=>him and at his feet. 
line 24171=>     Aragorn knelt beside him.  Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. 
line 24172=>At last slow  words came. 'I tried to take the Ring from Frodo ' he said. 'I  
line 24173=>am sorry. I have paid.' His glance strayed to his fallen enemies;  twenty at 
line 24174=>least lay there. 'They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken them. I 
line 24175=>think they  are  not  dead. Orcs bound them.' He paused and  his eyes closed 
line 24176=>wearily. After a moment he spoke again. 
line 24177=>     'Farewell, Aragorn!  Go to  M inas Tirith  and  save my  people!  I have 
line 24178=>failed.' 
line 24179=>     'No!'  said  Aragorn,  taking his hand and kissing  his brow. 'You have 
line 24180=>conquered. Few  have gained such a  victory. Be at peace! Minas Tirith shall  
line 24181=>not fall!' 
line 24182=>     Boromir smiled. 
line 24183=>     'Which way did they go? Was Frodo there?' said Aragorn. 
line 24184=>     But Boromir did not speak again. 
line 24185=>     'Alas!' said  Aragorn. 'Thus  passes the  heir of Denethor, Lord of the 
line 24186=>Tower of Guard! This is a bitter end. Now the Company is all  in ruin. It is 
line 24187=>I that  have failed. Vain was Gandalf's  trust in me.  What  shall I do now?  
line 24188=>Boromir has laid it on  me  to go  to Minas Tirith, and my heart desires it; 
line 24189=>but where are the  Ring and the Bearer? How shall I  find them  and save the  
line 24190=>Quest from disaster?' 
line 24191=>     He knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir's hand. 
line 24192=>So it  was  that Legolas  and  Gimli  found him.  They came from the western 
line 24193=>slopes of the hill, silently, creeping  through  the  trees as if  they were 
line 24194=>hunting. Gimli had  his axe in hand,  and  Legola s  his long knife:  all his 
line 24195=>arrows were spent. When  they came into the  glade they halted in amazement; 
line 24196=>and  then they stood a moment with heads bowed  in  grief,  for it seemed to 
line 24197=>them plain what had happened. 
line 24198=>     'Alas!'  said Legolas, coming to  Aragorn's  side. 'We have  hunted and 
line 24199=>slain many  Orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more use  here. We 
line 24200=>came when we heard the horn-but too late, it  seems. I  fear  you have taken 
line 24201=>deadly hurt.' 
line 24202=>
line 24203=>####-     'Boromir  is dead,' said Aragorn. 'I am unscathed,  for  I was not here 
line 24204=>with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill.' 
line 24205=>     'The hobbits!' cried Gimli 'Where are they then? Where is Frodo?' 
line 24206=>     'I do not know,' answered Aragorn wearily. 'Before he died Boromir told 
line 24207=>me that the Orcs had  bound them;  he  did not think that they were  dead. I 
line 24208=>sent him  to follow  Merry and Pippin; but I did not ask him if Frodo or Sam 
line 24209=>were with him: not until it was too  late.  All  that I have done  today has 
line 24210=>gone amiss. What is to be done now?' 
line 24211=>     'First  we must tend the fallen,'  said Legolas. 'We  cannot  leave him 
line 24212=>lying like carrion among these foul Orcs.' 
line 24213=>     'But we must be swift,' said Gimli. 'He would not wish us to linger. We 
line 24214=>must follow the Orcs, if there is hope  that  any of our Company are  living 
line 24215=>prisoners.' 
line 24216=>     'But we do not know whether the Ring-bearer is with them  or not ' said 
line 24217=>Aragorn.  'Are we to abandon him? Must we not seek him first? An evil choice 
line 24218=>is now before us!' 
line 24219=>     'Then let us do first what we must do,' said  Legolas. 'We have not the 
line 24220=>time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A 
line 24221=>cairn we might build.' 
line 24222=>     'The labour would be hard and long:  there are no stones that we  could 
line 24223=>use nearer than the water -side,' said Gimli. 
line 24224=>     'Then  let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his 
line 24225=>vanquished foes,' said Aragorn. 'We will send him to the Falls of Rauros and  
line 24226=>give him to Anduin. The River of Gondor will take care at least that no evil 
line 24227=>creature dishonours his bones.' 
line 24228=>     Quickly  they searched the bodies of  the Orcs, gathering  their swords 
line 24229=>and cloven helms and shields into  a  heap. 'See!' cried  Aragorn. 'Here  we 
line 24230=>find  tokens!' He picked  out  from the  pile  of grim weapons  two  knives,  
line 24231=>leaf-bladed, damasked  in go ld and red;  and searching further he found also 
line 24232=>the sheaths,  black, set with small red gems. 'No orc-tools these!' he said. 
line 24233=>'They were  borne by  the hobbits.  Doubtless the  Orcs despoiled them,  but 
line 24234=>feared  to keep  the knives,  knowing  them  for  wha t  they  are:  work  of 
line 24235=>Westernesse, wound about with spells  for the  bane of Mordor. Well, now, if 
line 24236=>they still  live,  our  friends are  weaponless. I will  take these  things,  
line 24237=>hoping against hope, to give them back.' 
line 24238=>     'And  I,' said Legolas,  'will take all the arrows that I can find, for  
line 24239=>my quiver is empty.' He  searched  in the  pile  and on the ground about and 
line 24240=>
line 24241=>####-found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows 
line 24242=>as the Orcs were accustomed to use. He looked at them closely. 
line 24243=>     And  Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'Here  lie many that are 
line 24244=>not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty  Mountains, if I 
line 24245=>know  anything of Orcs and their kinds.  And here are others  strange to me.  
line 24246=>Their gear is not after the manner of Orcs at all!' 
line 24247=>     There were four goblin-soldiers of greater  stature, swart, slant-eyed, 
line 24248=>with thick  legs and  large hands. They  were armed with short  broad-bladed 
line 24249=>swords, not with  the curved scimitars usual with Orcs: and they had bows  of 
line 24250=>yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men.  Upon their shields they bore 
line 24251=>a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on  the 
line 24252=>front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal. 
line 24253=>     'I have not seen  these tokens  before,'  said Aragorn.  'What  do they 
line 24254=>mean?' 
line 24255=>     'S is for Sauron,' said Gimli. 'That is easy to read.' 
line 24256=>     'Nay!' said Legolas. 'Sauron does not use the Elf-runes.' 
line 24257=>     'Neither  does he  use  his right name,  nor permit it  to be  spelt or 
line 24258=>spoken,' said Aragorn. 'And he does  not use white. The  Orcs in the service 
line 24259=>of Barad-dyr use the sign of the Red Eye.' He stood for a moment in thought. 
line 24260=>'S is for Saruman, I  guess,'  he  said at length. 'There  is evil afoot  in 
line 24261=>Isengard,  and the West is no longer safe. It is  as Gandalf feared: by some 
line 24262=>means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. It is likely too that 
line 24263=>he  knows  of  Gandalf's  fall.  Pursuers  from Moria may  have escaped  the 
line 24264=>vigilance of Lurien, or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard 
line 24265=>by other  paths. Orcs travel  fast.  But  Saruman has many  ways of learning 
line 24266=>news. Do you remember the birds?' 
line 24267=>     'Well,  we  have no time to ponder riddles,' said  Gimli. 'Let us  bear 
line 24268=>Boromir away!' 
line 24269=>     'But  after that  we  must guess  the riddles, if we  are to choose our 
line 24270=>course rightly,' answered Aragorn. 
line 24271=>     'Maybe there is no right choice,' said Gimli. 
line 24272=>     Taking his axe the  Dwarf now  cut  several branches. These they lashed 
line 24273=>together with bowstrings, and spread their  cloaks upon the frame. Upon this 
line 24274=>rough bier they carried the  body of  their companion to the shore, together  
line 24275=>with such trophies of  his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. 
line 24276=>It was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for  Boromir was  a  
line 24277=>man both tall and strong. 
line 24278=>
line 24279=>####-     At the water -side Aragorn  remained, watching the  bier. while  Legolas 
line 24280=>and Gimli hastened back on foot to Parth  Galen. It was  a mile or more, and 
line 24281=>it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the 
line 24282=>shore. 
line 24283=>     'There is a strange tale  to tell!'  said Legolas. 'There are  only two 
line 24284=>boats upon the bank. We could find no trace of the other.' 
line 24285=>     'Have Orcs been there?' asked Aragorn. 
line 24286=>     'We saw no signs of  them,' answered Gimli. 'And Orcs  would have taken 
line 24287=>or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.' 
line 24288=>     'I will look at the ground when we come there,' said Aragorn. 
line 24289=>     Now they laid  Boromir  in the middle of the boat that  was to bear him 
line 24290=>away. The grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. 
line 24291=>They combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. The golden 
line 24292=>belt of Lurien gleamed  about  his waist. His helm they set beside  him, and 
line 24293=>across  his lap  they laid the  cloven horn and  the hilts and shards of his 
line 24294=>sword; beneath his  feet  they put the swords of his enemies. Then fastening  
line 24295=>the  prow to the stern of the other boat,  they drew him out into the water. 
line 24296=>They rowed sadly along the shore, and turning into the swift -running channel 
line 24297=>they passed the green sward of Parth Galen. The steep  sides of  Tol Brandir  
line 24298=>were  glowing:  it  was now  mid-afternoon.  As they  went south the fume of 
line 24299=>Rauros rose and  shimmered before them, a haze of gold. The rush and thunder 
line 24300=>of the falls shook the windless air . 
line 24301=>     Sorrowfully  they  cast loose  the funeral  boat:  there  Boromir  lay, 
line 24302=>restful, peaceful, gliding upon  the bosom of the  flowing water. The stream 
line 24303=>took him while they  held their own boat back with their paddles. He floated 
line 24304=>by  them, and slowly  his  boat departed, waning to  a dark spot against the 
line 24305=>golden  light;  and then suddenly it vanished. Rauros  roared on unchanging. 
line 24306=>The River  had taken Boromir  son of Denethor,  and he was not seen again in 
line 24307=>Minas  Tirith,  standing as he used to  stand  upon  the  White Tower in the 
line 24308=>morning. But  in Gondor in after -days it long  was said that  the elven-boat 
line 24309=>rode  the falls  and the foaming pool, and bore him down  through Osgiliath, 
line 24310=>and  past the many mouths of Anduin, out  into the Great Sea at night  under  
line 24311=>the stars. 
line 24312=>     For a  while  the three companions remained  silent,  gazing after him. 
line 24313=>Then  Aragorn spoke. 'They will look for him from the White Tower,' he said, 
line 24314=>'but he will not return from mountain or from  sea.' Then slowly he began to 
line 24315=>sing: 
line 24316=>
line 24317=>####-     Through Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows 
line 24318=>     The West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes. 
line 24319=>     'What news from the West, O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight?  
line 24320=>     Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight?' 
line 24321=>     'I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey; 
line 24322=>     I saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away 
line 24323=>     Into the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more. 
line 24324=>     The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor.'  
line 24325=>     'O Boromir! From the high walls westward I looked afar, 
line 24326=>     But you came not from the empty lands where no men are.'  
line 24327=>      
line 24328=>Then Legolas sang: 
line 24329=> 
line 24330=>     From the mouths of the Sea the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones; 
line 24331=>     The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans. 
line 24332=>     'What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve? 
line 24333=>     Where now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve.'  
line 24334=>     'Ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie 
line 24335=>     On the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky; 
line 24336=>     So many have passed down Anduin to find the flowing Sea. 
line 24337=>     Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!'  
line 24338=>     'O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south, 
line 24339=>     But you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea's mouth.'  
line 24340=>     Then Aragorn sang again: 
line 24341=>     From the  Gate  of Kings  the  North Wind rides,  and past the  roaring falls;  
line 24342=>     And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls. 
line 24343=>     'What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me today? 
line 24344=>     What news of Boromir the Bold? For he is long away.'  
line 24345=>     'Beneath Amon Hen I heard his cry. There many foes he fought. 
line 24346=>     His cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought. 
line 24347=>     His head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest; 
line 24348=>     And Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast.'  
line 24349=>     'O Boromir! The Tower of Guard shall ever northward gaze 
line 24350=>     To Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end o f days.'  
line 24351=> 
line 24352=>     So they ended. Then they  turned  their boat and drove it with all  the 
line 24353=>speed they could against the stream back to Parth Galen. 
line 24354=>     'You left the  East Wind to  me,' said Gimli, 'but I will say naught of 
line 24355=>it.' 
line 24356=>     'That is as it should be,' said Aragorn. 'In  Minas Tirith  they endure 
line 24357=>the East Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. But now Boromir has taken 
line 24358=>
line 24359=>####-his road. and we must make haste to choose our own.' 
line 24360=>     He surveyed the green  lawn, quickly but  thoroughly, stooping often to 
line 24361=>the earth. 'The Orcs have been on this ground,' he  said. 'Otherwise nothing 
line 24362=>can be made  out for certain. All  our  footprints  are  here, crossing  and 
line 24363=>re-crossing. I cannot  tell  whether any of the hobbits have come back since 
line 24364=>the search for  Frodo  began.'  He returned  to the bank, close to where the 
line 24365=>rill  from the  spring  trickled  out into  the River. 'There are some clear 
line 24366=>prints here,' he  said. 'A hobbit waded out into the water and  back; but  I 
line 24367=>cannot say how long ago.' 
line 24368=>     'How then do you read this riddle?' asked Gimli. 
line 24369=>     Aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the  camping-place and 
line 24370=>looked  at  the baggage. 'Two  packs  are  missing.' he  said, 'and  one  is 
line 24371=>certainly Sam's:  it was rather large and heavy.  This  then  is the answe r: 
line 24372=>Frodo  has gone by boat, and his servant has  gone with him. Frodo must have 
line 24373=>returned while we were all away. I met Sam going up the hill and told him to 
line 24374=>follow me;  but plainly he  did  not do so. He guessed his master s mind and  
line 24375=>came  back here before Frodo had gone. He did  not find it easy to leave Sam 
line 24376=>behind!' 
line 24377=>     'But why should  he leave  us behind, and without  a word?' said Gimli. 
line 24378=>'That was a strange deed!' 
line 24379=>     'And a  brave deed,' said Aragorn. 'Sam was right,  I think.  Frodo did 
line 24380=>not wish to  lead any friend to death with him in Mordor. But he knew that he 
line 24381=>must go himself. Something happened after he left us that  overcame his fear 
line 24382=>and doubt.' 
line 24383=>     'Maybe hunting Orcs came on him and he fled,' said Legolas.  
line 24384=>     'He fled, certainly,' said Aragorn, 'but not, I think, from Orcs.' What 
line 24385=>he  thought was  the cause of Frodo's  sudden resolve and flight Aragorn did  
line 24386=>not say. The last words of Boromir he long kept secret. 
line 24387=>     'Well,  so much  at  least  is now clear,'  said Legolas:  'Frodo is no 
line 24388=>longer on this side of the  River:  only he can have taken the boat. And Sam 
line 24389=>is with him; only he would have taken his pack.' 
line 24390=>     'Our  choice then,' said Gimli, 'is either to take the  remaining  boat 
line 24391=>and follow Frodo, or else to follow  the Orcs on foot. There is little  hope 
line 24392=>either way. We have already lost precious hours.' 
line 24393=>     'Let me  think!' said Aragorn. 'And now  may I make a  right choice and 
line 24394=>change the  evil fate of this unhappy day!' He stood silent for a moment. 'I  
line 24395=>will follow the Orcs,' he said at last. 'I would have guided Frodo to Mordor  
line 24396=>
line 24397=>####-and  gone with  him to the end; but if I  seek him now  in the wilderness, I 
line 24398=>must abandon the captives to torment  and death.  My heart speaks clearly at 
line 24399=>last: the fate  of the Bearer  is in  my  hands no  longer .  The Company has 
line 24400=>played  its part. Yet we that  remain cannot forsake our companions while we 
line 24401=>have strength left.  Come!  We  will go  now. Leave  all  that can be spared 
line 24402=>behind! We will press on by day and dark!' 
line 24403=>     They drew up the  last  boat  and carried  it to  the trees.  They laid 
line 24404=>beneath  it such of their goods  as  they did not  need  and could not carry 
line 24405=>away. Then they left Parth Galen. The afternoon was fading as they came back  
line 24406=>to the glade where Boromir had fallen. There they picked up the trail of the 
line 24407=>Orcs. It needed little skill to find. 
line 24408=>     'No other folk  make such  a trampling,' said Legolas. 'It seems  their 
line 24409=>delight to slash and beat down  growing  things that are not even  in  their 
line 24410=>way.' 
line 24411=>     'But they go with a great  speed for all that,' said Aragorn, 'and they 
line 24412=>do not  tire. And later we  may have  to  search for our  path  in hard bare 
line 24413=>lands.' 
line 24414=>     'Well, after  them!' said Gimli. 'Dwarves too can  go swiftly, and they 
line 24415=>do not tire sooner  than Orcs. But it will be a long chase: they have a long 
line 24416=>start.' 
line 24417=>     'Yes,' said Aragorn, 'we  shall all need the endurance of  Dwarves. But 
line 24418=>come! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. And 
line 24419=>woe to them, if we prove the swifter! We  will make such a chase as shall be  
line 24420=>accounted a marvel among the Three Kindreds µ Elves. Dwarves, and Men. 
line 24421=>Forth 
line 24422=>the Three Hunters!' 
line 24423=>     Like a deer he sprang away. Through the trees he sped. On and on he led 
line 24424=>them,  tireless and swift, now that his mind  was at last made up. The woods 
line 24425=>about the lake they left behind. Long slopes  they climbed, dark, hard-edged 
line 24426=>against the  sky already red with sunset. Dusk came. They passed away,  grey 
line 24427=>shadows in a stony land. 
line 24428=> 
line 24429=>
line 24430=>####- 
line 24431=>
line 24432=>Chapter 2. The Riders of Rohan 
line 24433=>
line 24434=> 
line 24435=> 
line 24436=>     Dusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and  brooded 
line 24437=>on  the pale margins of the Anduin, but the  sky was clear. Stars  came out. 
line 24438=>The waxing  moon  was riding in the West, and the shadows of the rocks  were 
line 24439=>black. They had come to  the feet of stony hills, and their pace was slower, 
line 24440=>for the trail was no longer easy to  follow. Here the highlands of the  Emyn 
line 24441=>Muil ran from North to South in two long tumbled ridges. The western side of 
line 24442=>each ridge was steep  and difficult, but  the  eastward slopes were gentler, 
line 24443=>furrowed  with  many  gullies  and  narrow  ravines.  All  night  the  three 
line 24444=>companions scrambled in  this bony land, climbing to the  crest of the first  
line 24445=>and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley 
line 24446=>on the other side. 
line 24447=>     There in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. 
line 24448=>The moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the 
line 24449=>first light  of day had not  yet come over the dark  hills behind.  For  the 
line 24450=>moment Aragorn was at a loss:  the  orc-trail had descended into the valley, 
line 24451=>but there it had vanished. 
line 24452=>     'Which way would they turn, do you  think?' said Legolas. 'Northward to 
line 24453=>take a straighter road to Isengard,  or Fangorn, if that is their aim as you  
line 24454=>guess? Or southward to strike the Entwash?' 
line 24455=>     'They will not make  for  the  river,  whatever mark they aim at'' said 
line 24456=>Aragorn. 'And unless there is much amiss  in Rohan and  the power of Saruman 
line 24457=>is greatly increased;  they will take  the  shortest way that they  can find 
line 24458=>over the fields of the Rohirrim. Let us search northwards!' 
line 24459=>     The  dale  ran like  a stony  trough between  the  ridged  hills, and a  
line 24460=>trickling stream flowed among the boulders  at the  bottom. A cliff  frowned 
line 24461=>upon their right; to their left rose  grey  slopes, dim  and shadowy in  the 
line 24462=>late night.  They  went  on  for  a  mile  or  more northwards. Aragorn  was 
line 24463=>searching. bent towards  the ground,  among the folds and gullies leading up 
line 24464=>into  the western ridge. Legolas was some way ahead. Suddenly the Elf gave a  
line 24465=>cry and the others came running towards him. 
line 24466=>     'We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' he said. 
line 24467=>'Look!' He pointed, and they saw that  what they had  at  first  taken to be 
line 24468=>boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled  bodies. Five dead Orcs 
line 24469=>
line 24470=>####-lay there. They had  been hewn  with many  cruel strokes, and  two had  been 
line 24471=>beheaded. The ground was wet with their dark blood. 
line 24472=>     'Here is another riddle!' said Gimli.  'But it needs the light  of  day 
line 24473=>and for that we cannot wait.' 
line 24474=>     'Yet however you  read it,  it  seems  not  unhopeful,'  said  Legolas.  
line 24475=>'Enemies  of the  Orcs  are  likely to  be our friends. Do any folk dwell in 
line 24476=>these hills?' 
line 24477=>     'No,' said Aragorn. 'The Rohirrim seldom come  here, and it is far from 
line 24478=>Minas Tirith. It might be that some  company of  Men  were  hunting here for 
line 24479=>reasons that we do not know. Yet I think not.' 
line 24480=>     'What do you think?' said Gimli. 
line 24481=>     'I think that  the  enemy  brought his  own enemy  with  him,' answered 
line 24482=>Aragorn. 'These are Northern Orcs from far away. Among the slain are none of 
line 24483=>the great  Orcs with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is 
line 24484=>no uncommon thing with these foul  folk. Maybe there was some  dispute about 
line 24485=>the road.' 
line 24486=>     'Or about the  captives,' said  Gimli. 'Let us hope that they, too, did 
line 24487=>not meet their end here.' 
line 24488=>     Aragorn  searched the ground in a wide  circle,  but no other traces of 
line 24489=>the fight could be found. They went on. Already the eastward sky was turning 
line 24490=>pale; the  stars were fading, and a grey light was  slowly growing. A little 
line 24491=>further  north they  came  to  a fold  in which a tiny stream,  falling  and 
line 24492=>winding, had cut a stony path down into  the valley. In it some bushes grew,  
line 24493=>and there were patches of grass upon its sides. 
line 24494=>     'At last!'  said Aragorn.  'Here are  the tracks that  we seek! Up this 
line 24495=>water -channel: this is the way that the Orcs went after their debate.' 
line 24496=>     Swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path.  As if fresh 
line 24497=>from a  night's rest they sprang  from stone to stone. At last  they reached 
line 24498=>the  crest of  the  grey hill,  and a  sudden breeze blew in  their hair and 
line 24499=>stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn. 
line 24500=>     Turning  back they saw across  the  River  the  far hills kindled.  Day 
line 24501=>leaped into the sky. The red rim of the  sun rose over  the shoulders of the 
line 24502=>dark  land. Before them in the West the world lay still, formless  and grey; 
line 24503=>but even  as they looked,  the shadows of night melted, the  colours  of the 
line 24504=>waking earth returned: green flowed over the wide meads  of Rohan; the white 
line 24505=>mists shimmered in  the watervales;  and far off to the left, thirty leagues 
line 24506=>or more, blue  and purple stood the  White Mountains,  rising  into peaks of 
line 24507=>
line 24508=>####-jet, tipped with glimmering snows, flushed with the rose of morning. 
line 24509=>     'Gondor! Gondor!' cried  Aragorn. 'Would that I looked on  you again in 
line 24510=>happier hour! Not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams.  
line 24511=>     Gondor! Gondor, between the Mountains and the Sea! 
line 24512=>     West Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver Tree 
line 24513=>     Fell like bright rain in gardens of the Kings of old. 
line 24514=>     O proud walls! White towers! O winged crown and throne of gold! 
line 24515=>     O Gondor, Gondor! Shall Men behold the Silver Tree, 
line 24516=>     Or West Wind blow again between the Mountains and the Sea?  
line 24517=>     Now  let  us go!' he said , drawing his  eyes away from  the South,  and 
line 24518=>looking out west and north to the way that he must tread. 
line 24519=>     The ridge upon  which the companions  stood  went down  steeply  before 
line 24520=>their feet. Below it twenty  fathoms or  more, there was  a wide and  rugged 
line 24521=>shelf which ended suddenly in the brink  of a sheer  cliff: the East Wall of 
line 24522=>Rohan.  So  ended  the  Emyn Muil, and  the  green plains  of  the  Rohirrim 
line 24523=>stretched away before them to the edge of sight. 
line 24524=>     'Look!' cried Legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. 'There 
line 24525=>is the eagle  again! He is very high. He seems  to be flying now away,  from 
line 24526=>this land back to the North. He is going with great speed. Look!' 
line 24527=>     'No, not even my eyes can  see him, my good Legolas,' said Aragorn. 'He 
line 24528=>must  be far aloft indeed. I wonder  what  is his errand, if he is the  same 
line 24529=>bird that I have seen before. But look! I  can  see something nearer at hand 
line 24530=>and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!' 
line 24531=>     'Many  things,'  said  Legolas. 'It is a great company on foot;  but  I 
line 24532=>cannot  say  more,  nor see what kind of folk they  may  be. They  are  many 
line 24533=>leagues  away: twelve,  I  guess; but  the flatness of the plain is hard  to 
line 24534=>measure.' 
line 24535=>     'I think,  nonetheless, that we no longer  need any  trail  to  tell us 
line 24536=>which  way  to go,' said Gimli. 'Let  us find a path down to  the  fields as 
line 24537=>quick as may be.' 
line 24538=>     'I  doubt  if you will  find a path quicker  than the one that the Orcs 
line 24539=>chose,' said Aragorn. 
line 24540=>     They  followed their enemies now  by the clear light  of day. It seemed 
line 24541=>that the Orcs had  pressed on with all possible speed. Every  now  and again 
line 24542=>the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the 
line 24543=>rinds and crusts of hard grey bread. a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed 
line 24544=>shoe  broken on the stones. The trail  led them  north along the top  of the 
line 24545=>
line 24546=>####-escarpment, and at length they  came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a  
line 24547=>stream  that  splashed  noisily down.  In the  narrow  ravine  a rough  path 
line 24548=>descended like a steep stair into the plain. 
line 24549=>     At  the bottom  they came with  a strange  suddenness  on the grass  of 
line 24550=>Rohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the Emyn Muil. The 
line 24551=>falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water -plants,  and  
line 24552=>they could  hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle  slopes 
line 24553=>towards the fens of Entwash Vale far  away.  They seemed to have left winter  
line 24554=>clinging  to  the  hills  behind. Here  the air was softer  and warmer,  and 
line 24555=>faintly  scented,  as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing 
line 24556=>again in  herb and leaf. Legolas took a deep breath,  like one that drinks a  
line 24557=>great draught after long thirst in barren places. 
line 24558=>     'Ah!  the green smell!'  he said. 'It is better than much sleep. Let us 
line 24559=>run! ' 
line 24560=>     'Light feet may run swiftly here,' said Aragorn.  'More swiftly, maybe, 
line 24561=>than iron-shod Orcs. Now we have a chance to lessen their lead!' 
line 24562=>     They went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an 
line 24563=>eager  light was  in their eyes.  Nearly due  west the  broad  swath  of the 
line 24564=>marching Orcs  tramped  its  ugly slot;  the sweet  grass of  Rohan had been 
line 24565=>bruised and  blackened as  they  passed. Presently  Aragorn  gave a cry  and  
line 24566=>turned aside. 'Stay!' he shouted. 'Do not follow me yet!'  He ran quickly to 
line 24567=>the right, away  from the  main trail; for he had seen  footprints that went 
line 24568=>that way, branching off  from the  others,  the  marks of small unshod feet. 
line 24569=>These, however, did  not go far before they were crossed by orc-prints, also 
line 24570=>coming out  from the main  trail behind and in  front, and then  they curved 
line 24571=>sharply back  again  and were lost  in the  trampling. At the furthest point 
line 24572=>Aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back. 
line 24573=>     'Yes,' he said, 'they are quite plain:  a hobbit's footprints. Pippin's 
line 24574=>I think. He is smaller than the other. And look at this! He held up a  thing 
line 24575=>that glittered in  the sunlight. It  looked  like  the new-opened leaf of  a  
line 24576=>beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain. 
line 24577=>     'The brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried Legolas and Gimli together. 
line 24578=>     'Not idly do the leaves of Lurien  fall,' said  Aragorn.  'This did not 
line 24579=>drop by chance: it  was  cast away as  a token to  any that  might follow. I 
line 24580=>think Pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose.' 
line 24581=>     'Then he at least was alive,'  said  Gimli. 'And he  had the use of his 
line 24582=>wits, and of his legs too. That is heartening. We do not pursue in vain.' 
line 24583=>
line 24584=>####-     'Let us hope that  he  did not pay  too dearly for his  boldness,' said 
line 24585=>Legolas.  'C ome! Let us  go on! The thought of those merry young folk  driven 
line 24586=>like cattle burns my heart.' 
line 24587=>     The  sun climbed to  the noon and then rode slowly  down the sky. Light 
line 24588=>clouds  came up out of the sea in the distant South and were blown away upon 
line 24589=>the breeze. The sun sank. Shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from 
line 24590=>the East. Still the hunters held on.  One day  now had  passed since Boromir  
line 24591=>fell, and  the Orcs were yet far ahead. No longer could any sight of them be 
line 24592=>seen in the level plains.  
line 24593=>     As nightshade was closing about  them Aragorn halted. Only twice in the 
line 24594=>day's  march had they rested for a brief  while, and twelve leagues  now lay 
line 24595=>between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn. 
line 24596=>     'We have  come at last  to  a hard choice,' he said.  'Shall we  rest by 
line 24597=>night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?' 
line 24598=>     'Unless  our enemies rest also, they  will  leave us far  behind, if we 
line 24599=>stay to  sleep.' said Legolas. 'Surely even Orcs must pause on  the  march?' 
line 24600=>said Gimli. 'Seldom will  Orcs journey in the open under the sun.  yet these 
line 24601=>have done so,' said Legolas. 'Certainly they will not rest by night.' 
line 24602=>     'But if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' said Gimli. 
line 24603=>     'The trail is straight, and turns  neither right nor left, as far as my 
line 24604=>eyes can see,' said Legolas.  
line 24605=>     'Maybe,  I could  lead you  at guess in the darkness  and  hold  to the 
line 24606=>line,'  said  Aragorn;  'but  if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when 
line 24607=>light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.' 
line 24608=>     'And  there  is  this also,' said Gimli: 'only by day can we see if any 
line 24609=>tracks lead away.  If a prisoner should escape, or if one should be  carried 
line 24610=>off, eastward,  say, to the Great River,  towards Mordor, we might pass  the 
line 24611=>signs and never know it.' 
line 24612=>     'That  is true,'  said Aragorn. 'But if I  read  the signs back  yonder  
line 24613=>rightly, the Orcs of the White Hand prevailed, and the whole company  is now 
line 24614=>bound for Isengard. Their present course bears me out.' 
line 24615=>     'Yet it would  be rash to be sure of  their counsels,' said Gimli. 'And 
line 24616=>what of escape? In the dark we  should have passed the signs that led you to 
line 24617=>the brooch.' 
line 24618=>     'The Orcs will  be doubly on their  guard since then, and the prisoners 
line 24619=>even wearier,' said Legolas. 'There will  be no  escape again, if we  do not 
line 24620=>contrive  it. How  that is to be done cannot  be guessed, but first we  must  
line 24621=>
line 24622=>####-overtake them.' 
line 24623=>     'And yet even I,  Dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my 
line 24624=>folk, cannot run all the way to Isengard without any pause ' said Gimli. 'My 
line 24625=>heart burns me too, and I would  have  started sooner but now I must  rest a  
line 24626=>little to run the  better. And if we  rest, then the blind night is the time 
line 24627=>to do so.' 
line 24628=>     'I said that  it  was a  hard  choice,' said Aragorn.  'How shall we end 
line 24629=>this debate?' 
line 24630=>     'You are our guide,' said Gimli, 'and you are skilled in the chase. You  
line 24631=>shall choose.' 
line 24632=>     'My heart  bids me go on,'  said Legolas. 'But we must hold together. I 
line 24633=>will follow your counsel.' 
line 24634=>     'You give the choice to an ill chooser,' said Aragorn. 'Since we passed 
line 24635=>through the Argonath  my  choices have  gone amiss.' He  fell  silent gazing 
line 24636=>north and west into the gathering night for a long while. 
line 24637=>     'We will  not walk in  the dark,'  he  said at length.   'The  peril  of 
line 24638=>missing the trail  or  signs  of  other  coming and  going seems to  me  the 
line 24639=>greater. If the  Moon gave enough  light, we would use it, but alas! he sets 
line 24640=>early and is yet young and pale.' 
line 24641=>     'And  tonight he is shrouded anyway,' Gimli murmured.  'Would  that the 
line 24642=>Lady had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to Frodo!' 
line 24643=>     'It will be more needed  where it is bestowed,' said Aragorn. 'With him 
line 24644=>lies  the true Quest.  Ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this 
line 24645=>time. A vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no  choice of mine can 
line 24646=>mar or mend. Well, I have chosen. So let us use the time as best we may!' 
line 24647=>     He  cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he  had 
line 24648=>not slept since their night under the shadow of Tol Brandir. Before dawn was 
line 24649=>in the sky he woke and rose.  Gimli  was still deep in slumber,  but Legolas 
line 24650=>was standing,  gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as 
line 24651=>a young tree in a windless night.  
line 24652=>     'They are  far far away,' he said sadly, turning to Aragorn. 'I know in 
line 24653=>my heart that they have not rested this night.  Only an eagle could overtake 
line 24654=>them now.' 
line 24655=>     'Nonetheless we will still follow as we may,' said Aragorn. Stooping he 
line 24656=>roused the Dwarf. 'Come! We must go,' he said. 'The scent is growing cold.' 
line 24657=>     'But it is still dark,' said Gimli. 'Even Legolas on a  hill-top  could 
line 24658=>not see them till the Sun is up.' 
line 24659=>
line 24660=>####-     'I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon 
line 24661=>or sun,' said Legolas.  
line 24662=>     'Where sight fails the earth may  bring us rumour,' said  Aragorn. 'The 
line 24663=>land  must  groan under  their hated  feet.' He stretched  himself  upon the 
line 24664=>ground with his ear pressed against the turf. He lay  there  motionless, for  
line 24665=>so long a time that Gimli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again. 
line 24666=>Dawn came glimmering, and  slowly a grey  light grew about them.  At last he 
line 24667=>rose, and now his friends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his 
line 24668=>look was troubled. 
line 24669=>     'The rumour of the earth is dim and confused,' he said. 'Nothing  walks 
line 24670=>upon it for many miles about  us. Faint and far are the feet of our enemies.  
line 24671=>But loud are the hoofs of the horses. It comes to my mind that I heard them,  
line 24672=>even  as  I lay on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams:  hor ses 
line 24673=>galloping, passing  in the West. But now they are  drawing ever further from 
line 24674=>us, riding northward. I wonder what is happening in this land!' 
line 24675=>     'Let us go!' said Legolas.  
line 24676=>     So the third day of their pursuit began. During  all its long  hours of 
line 24677=>cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now striding, now running, as if no 
line 24678=>weariness could quench the  fire that burned them.  They seldom spoke.  Over  
line 24679=>the  wide solitude they  passed  and their elven-cloaks  faded  against  the 
line 24680=>background of the grey-green fields; even  in the cool  sunlight  of mid-day 
line 24681=>few but elvish eyes would have marked them, until they  were close  at hand. 
line 24682=>Often  in their  hearts  they thanked the Lady  of  Lurien for  the gift  of 
line 24683=>lembas, for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran. 
line 24684=>     All day the track of  their enemies led  straight  on, going north-west 
line 24685=>without a break or turn. As once again the  day wore to its end they came to  
line 24686=>long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low 
line 24687=>humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter  as it bent north towards 
line 24688=>them, for  the ground became harder  and the grass  shorter. Far away to the 
line 24689=>left  the river Entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor.  No  moving 
line 24690=>thing could be seen. Often Aragorn wondered  that they saw no sign  of beast 
line 24691=>or  man. The dwellings of the  Rohirrim were for the most  part many leagues 
line 24692=>away to the South, under the wooded eaves of the White Mountains, now 
line 24693=>hidden 
line 24694=>in mist and cloud;  yet  the Horse-lords  had formerly  kept  many  herds and  
line 24695=>studs  in  the Eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the 
line 24696=>herdsmen had wandered much, living  in  camp  and tent, even in winter -time. 
line 24697=>
line 24698=>####-But now  all the land was empty, and there was silence  that did not seem to  
line 24699=>be the quiet of peace. 
line 24700=>     At  dusk they halted  again. Now twice twelve  leagues  they had passed 
line 24701=>over  the plains of Rohan  and  the wall of  the Emyn Muil was  lost in  the 
line 24702=>shadows  of the East. The  young moon  was glimmering in a misty sky, but it 
line 24703=>gave small light, and the stars were veiled. 
line 24704=>     'Now  do I most  grudge  a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said 
line 24705=>Legolas. 'The Orcs have run before us, as if  the very whips  of Sauron were 
line 24706=>behind them. I fear they have already reached the forest and  the dark hills, 
line 24707=>and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.' 
line 24708=>     Gimli ground his  teeth. 'This  is a bitter end to our  hope and to all 
line 24709=>our toil!' he said. 
line 24710=>     'To  hope, maybe, but  not to  toil,'  said Aragorn. 'We shall not turn 
line 24711=>back here. Yet I am weary.' He gazed  back along the  way that they had come 
line 24712=>towards the night gathering in the East. 'There is something strange at work 
line 24713=>in this land.  I distrust the  silence. I  distrust even  the pale Moon. The 
line 24714=>stars are  faint; and I am weary a s I have  seldom been before,  weary as no 
line 24715=>Ranger should be with a clear trail to follow. There is some will that lends 
line 24716=>speed  to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is 
line 24717=>in the heart more than in the limb.' 
line 24718=>     'Truly!' said Legolas. 'That I have known since first we came down from 
line 24719=>the Emyn Muil. For the will is not behind us but before us.' He pointed away 
line 24720=>over the  land  of  Rohan  into  the darkling West  under  the sickle  moon. 
line 24721=>'Saruman!'  muttered Aragorn. 'But he shall not  turn  us back!  Halt we must  
line 24722=>once more; for,  see! even the  Moon  is falling  into gathering  cloud. But 
line 24723=>north lies our road between down and fen when day returns.' 
line 24724=>     As before Legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. 'Awake!  
line 24725=>Awake!' he cried. 'It is a red dawn. Strange things await us by the eaves of 
line 24726=>the forest. Good or evil, I do not know; but we are called. Awake!' 
line 24727=>     The others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the 
line 24728=>downs  drew near. It was still an hour before  noon when they  reached them: 
line 24729=>green slopes rising to bare ridges  that ran in a line straight  towards the 
line 24730=>North. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long strip 
line 24731=>of  sunken  land,  some  ten  miles  wide, lay  between them  and the  river  
line 24732=>wandering deep in  dim  thickets of reed  and rush. Just to  the West of the 
line 24733=>southernmost slope there was a great ring, where  the turf had been torn and 
line 24734=>beaten by many trampling feet. From it  the orc-trail ran out again, turning 
line 24735=>
line 24736=>####-north along the  dr y  skirts  of the hills. Aragorn halted and examined  the 
line 24737=>tracks closely. 
line 24738=>     'They rested here a  while,' he said,  'but even the outward  trail  is 
line 24739=>already  old. I  fear  that your  heart  spoke truly,  Legolas: it is thrice 
line 24740=>twelve hours, I guess, since the Orcs stood where we now stand. If they held 
line 24741=>to their pace,  then  at sundown  yesterday they would reach  the borders of 
line 24742=>Fangorn.' 
line 24743=>     'I can see nothing  away north or west but  grass dwindling into mist,' 
line 24744=>said Gimli. 'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?' 
line 24745=>     'It is  still  far  away,'  said Aragorn. 'If I remember rightly, these 
line 24746=>downs run  eight leagues  or  more to the north, and then north-west to  the 
line 24747=>issuing of the Entwash there lies still a wide land. another fifteen leagues 
line 24748=>it may be.' 
line 24749=>     'Well, let  us go on,' said Gimli. 'My legs must forget the miles. They 
line 24750=>would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.' 
line 24751=>     The sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the  end of the line 
line 24752=>of  downs.  For many  hours they had  marched without rest. They  were going 
line 24753=>slowly now, and Gimli's back was bent.  Stone-hard are the Dwarves in labour 
line 24754=>or journey, but this endless  chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed 
line 24755=>in his heart. Aragorn walked behind  him, grim and silent,  stooping now and 
line 24756=>again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. Only Legolas still stepped 
line 24757=>as  lightly as ever,  his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no 
line 24758=>footprints  as he passed; but in  the waybread of the Elves he found all the 
line 24759=>sustenance tha t he needed, and  he could sleep, if sleep it  could be called 
line 24760=>by Men, resting his mind in the strange  paths of elvish dreams,  even as he 
line 24761=>walked open-eyed in the light of this world. 
line 24762=>     'Let us go  up on to this green hill!' he said.  Wearily they  fol lowed 
line 24763=>him, climbing the long slope, until  they  came out upon the  top. It  was a  
line 24764=>round hill smooth and  bare, standing by itself,  the  most northerly of the 
line 24765=>downs. The sun sank  and  the  shadows of evening fell  like a curtain. They  
line 24766=>were alone  in a gr ey formless world without mark or measure. Only  far away 
line 24767=>north-west  there  was  a  deeper darkness  against  the  dying  light:  the 
line 24768=>Mountains of Mist and the forest at their feet. 
line 24769=>     'Nothing can  we see to guide us here,' said Gimli. 'Well, now we  must  
line 24770=>halt again and wear the night away. It is growing cold!' 
line 24771=>     'The wind is north from the snows,' said Aragorn. 
line 24772=>     'And ere morning  it will be in  the East,' said Legolas.  'But rest if 
line 24773=>
line 24774=>####-you must. Yet  do  not cast all hope away. Tomorrow is unknown.  Rede oft is 
line 24775=>found at the rising of the Sun.' 
line 24776=>     'Three  suns already have risen on  our  chase and brought no counsel ' 
line 24777=>said Gimli. 
line 24778=>     The  night  grew  ever  colder.  Aragorn  and Gimli slept fitfully, and 
line 24779=>whenever they awoke they saw Legolas standing beside them, or walking to 
line 24780=>and 
line 24781=>fro, singing softly to  himself in his own tongue, and as  he sang the white 
line 24782=>stars  opened in  the hard black vault above. So the  night passed. Together  
line 24783=>they watched the dawn grow slowly in the  sky, now bare and cloudless, until 
line 24784=>at  last the sunrise came. It was pale and clear. The  wind was  in the East  
line 24785=>and  all the mists had rolled away;  wide lands lay bleak about them in  the 
line 24786=>bitter light. 
line 24787=>     Ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan that 
line 24788=>they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North-
line 24789=>westward 
line 24790=>stalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy 
line 24791=>eaves, and its  further  slopes  faded into  the distant blue. Beyond  there 
line 24792=>glimmered far away, as if floating  on a  grey cloud, the white head of tall 
line 24793=>Methedras, the  last  peak  of  the  Misty Mountains. Out of  the forest the 
line 24794=>Entwash flowed to meet them, its  stream now swift and narrow, and its banks 
line 24795=>deep-cloven. The orc-trail turned from the downs towards it. 
line 24796=>     Following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river  
line 24797=>back towards the forest,  Aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green,  a dark  
line 24798=>swift-moving  blur.  He cast  himself upon  the  ground  and  listened again 
line 24799=>intently.  But Legolas stood beside him, shading  his bright elven-eyes with 
line 24800=>his long slender hand, and he saw not a  shadow, nor  a blur, but the  small 
line 24801=>figures  of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of 
line 24802=>their spears was  like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal 
line 24803=>sight. Far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.  
line 24804=>     There was a silence  in the empty fields, arid Gimli could hear the air 
line 24805=>moving in the grass.  
line 24806=>     'Riders!' cried Aragorn, springing to  his feet.  'Many riders on swift 
line 24807=>steeds are coming towards us!' 
line 24808=>     'Yes,' said Legolas, 'there are one hundred  and five. Yellow is  their 
line 24809=>hair, and bright are their spears. Their leader is very tall.' 
line 24810=>     Aragorn smiled. 'Keen are the eyes of the Elves,' he said. 
line 24811=>
line 24812=>####-     'Nay!  The  riders are little  more  than  five leagues distant,'  said 
line 24813=>Legolas.  
line 24814=>     'Five leagues or  one,' said Gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare 
line 24815=>land. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?' 
line 24816=>     'We will wait,' said Aragorn. 'I  am weary, and our hunt has failed. Or 
line 24817=>at least  others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the 
line 24818=>orc-trail. We may get new s from them.' 
line 24819=>     'Or spears,' said Gimli. 
line 24820=>     'There are three empty saddles, but I see no hobbits,' said Legolas. 
line 24821=>     'I did not say that we should hear good news,' said  Aragorn. 'But evil 
line 24822=>or good we will await it here.' 
line 24823=>     The three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy  
line 24824=>mark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward  slope. 
line 24825=>A little  above the hill's foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about 
line 24826=>them, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass. The time passed slowly 
line 24827=>and heavily. The wind was thin and searching. Gimli was uneasy. 
line 24828=>     'What do you know of these horsemen, Aragorn?' he said. 'Do we sit here 
line 24829=>waiting for sudden death?' 
line 24830=>     'I have been among them,' answered Aragorn. 'They are proud and wilful, 
line 24831=>but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; 
line 24832=>wise but unlearned,  writing no books  but  singing many  songs,  after  the 
line 24833=>manner of the children of Men before the Dark Years. But I do not know  what 
line 24834=>has happened here of late, nor in what mind the Rohirrim may now  be between 
line 24835=>the traitor  Saruman and the threat of  Sauron.  They  have  long  been  the 
line 24836=>friends of the people of Gondor, though they are not akin to them. It was in 
line 24837=>forgotten years long ago that Eorl the Young brought them out of  the North,  
line 24838=>and  their  kinship  is rather  with  the  Bardings  of  Dale, and with  the 
line 24839=>Beornings of the Wood,  among whom may still be seen many men tall and 
line 24840=>fair, 
line 24841=>as are the Riders of Rohan. At least they will not love the Orcs.' 
line 24842=>     'But Gandalf spoke of a  rumour that they pay tribute to Mordor '  said 
line 24843=>Gimli. 
line 24844=>     'I believe it no more than did Boromir,' answered Aragorn. 
line 24845=>     'You will soon learn the truth,' said Legolas. 'Already they approach.' 
line 24846=>     At length even Gimli could  hear the distant  beat of  galloping hoofs. 
line 24847=>The horsemen,  following  the trail, had  turned  from the  river,   and were 
line 24848=>drawing near the downs. They were riding like the wind. 
line 24849=>
line 24850=>####-     Now the  cries  of clear strong voices  came ringing over  the  fields. 
line 24851=>Suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and  the foremost horseman 
line 24852=>swerved, passing by  the  foot  of  the  hill,  and  leading  the  host  back  
line 24853=>southward along the western skirts of the downs. After him they rode: a long 
line 24854=>line of mail-clad men. swift, shining, fell and fair to look upon. 
line 24855=>     Their horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed; their grey 
line 24856=>coats  glistened, their  long tails flowed  in the  wind, their  manes  were 
line 24857=>braided on their proud necks. The Men that rode them matched them well: tall 
line 24858=>and long-limbed; their hair, flaxen -pale,  flowed under  their  light helms,  
line 24859=>and streamed in long braids behind them; their faces were stern and keen. In 
line 24860=>their  hands were tall  spears of ash,  painted  shields were slung at their 
line 24861=>backs, long swords were at their belts, their burnished skirts of  mail hung 
line 24862=>down upon their knees.  
line 24863=>     In pairs  they galloped  by, and though every now  and then one rose in 
line 24864=>his  stirrups  and  gazed ahead  and to  either side, they appeared  not  to 
line 24865=>perceive  the three strangers sitting silently and  watching them. The  host  
line 24866=>had almost passed  when  suddenly Aragorn  st ood  up, and  called in a  loud 
line 24867=>voice: 
line 24868=>     'What news from the North, Riders of Rohan?' 
line 24869=>     With astonishing speed and  skill they  checked  their steeds, wheeled, 
line 24870=>and came charging round.  Soon the three companions  found  themselves  in a  
line 24871=>ring of horsemen  moving in a running circle, up the hill -slope  behind them 
line 24872=>and down,  round and round  them, and  drawing  ever inwards. Aragorn  stood 
line 24873=>silent, and  the other two  sat  without  moving, wondering what  way things 
line 24874=>would turn. 
line 24875=>     Without a word or cry, suddenly, the Riders halted. A thicket of spears 
line 24876=>were  pointed towards the strangers; and some  of the  horsemen had bows  in 
line 24877=>hand, and their  arrows were  already fitted  to the  string. Then one  rode 
line 24878=>forward, a tall man, taller than  all the rest; from  his helm as a crest  a  
line 24879=>white horsetail flowed. He advanced  until the point of his spear was within 
line 24880=>a foot of Aragorn's breast. Aragorn did not stir. 
line 24881=>     'Who are  you,  and what are you doing  in this  land?' said the Rider, 
line 24882=>using the  Common Speech of the West, in manner and tone like  to the speech 
line 24883=>of Boromir, Man of Gondor. 
line 24884=>     'I am called Strider,' answered Aragorn. 'I came out of the North. I am 
line 24885=>hunting Orcs.' 
line 24886=>     The Rider leaped from  his horse. Giving his spear to another  who rode 
line 24887=>
line 24888=>####-up and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with  
line 24889=>Aragorn, surveying him keenly, and not  without wonder. At  length  he spoke 
line 24890=>again. 
line 24891=>     'At first I thought that you yourselves were Orcs,' he said; 'but now I 
line 24892=>see that it is  not so. Indeed  you know  little of Orcs, if  you go hunting 
line 24893=>them  in this  fashion.  They were swift and well-armed, and they were many. 
line 24894=>You would have changed from hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them. 
line 24895=>But there is something strange about you, Strider.' He bent his clear bright 
line 24896=>eyes again upon the Ranger. 'That  is  no name for a Man that  you give. And 
line 24897=>strange too is your raiment.  Have you sprung out of the  grass? How did you 
line 24898=>escape our sight? Are you elvish folk?' 
line 24899=>     'No,'  said  Aragorn.  'One  only of us  is an  Elf, Legolas  from  the 
line 24900=>Woodland Realm in  distant Mirkwood. But we have  passed through 
line 24901=>Lothlurien, 
line 24902=>and the gifts and favour of the Lady go with us.' 
line 24903=>     The Rider looked at them  with  renewed wonder, but  his eyes hardened. 
line 24904=>'Then there  is a Lady in the Golden Wood, as old tales tell!' he said. 'Few 
line 24905=>escape  her  nets, they  say. These are  strange days! But if  you  have her  
line 24906=>favour, then you  also are  net -weavers and  sorcerers,  maybe.' He turned a  
line 24907=>cold glance suddenly upon Legolas and Gimli.  'Why do you  not speak, silent 
line 24908=>ones?' he demanded. 
line 24909=>     Gimli  rose and  planted  his feet  firmly apart: his hand gripped  the 
line 24910=>handle  of  his  axe,  and  his  dark  eyes flashed.  'Give  me  your  name, 
line 24911=>horse-master, and I will give you mine, and more besides,' he said. 
line 24912=>     'As for that,' said the Rider, staring down at the Dwarf, 'the stranger  
line 24913=>should declare  himself first. Yet I am named  Jomer  son of Jomund,  and am 
line 24914=>called the Third Marshal of Riddermark.' 
line 24915=>     'Then Jomer son  of Jomund,  Third Marshal of Riddermark, let Gimli the 
line 24916=>Dwarf  Gluin's son warn you against foolish  words.  You speak evil of  that 
line 24917=>which is fair  beyond the  reach  of your  thought, and only little  wit can 
line 24918=>excuse you.' 
line 24919=>     Jomer's eyes  blazed, and the Men of Rohan murmured angrily, and closed 
line 24920=>in, advancing  their  spears. 'I  would cut  off your  head, beard and  all, 
line 24921=>Master Dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground ' said Jomer. 
line 24922=>     'He stands not  alone,'  said Legolas,  bending his bow and fitting  an 
line 24923=>arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight. 'You would  die before  your 
line 24924=>stroke fell.' 
line 24925=>
line 24926=>####-     Jomer  raised  his sword, and things might  have  gone ill, but Aragorn 
line 24927=>sprang  between them, and raised his hand. 'Your pardon,  Jomer!' he  cried.  
line 24928=>'When you know more you will understand why  you have angered my 
line 24929=>companions.  
line 24930=>We intend no  evil to Rohan,  nor to any of its folk, neither to man  nor to 
line 24931=>horse. Will you not hear our tale before you strike?' 
line 24932=>     'I  will,'  said  Jomer  lowering  his  blade. 'Bu t  wanderers  in  the 
line 24933=>Riddermark  would be  wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt.  First  
line 24934=>tell me your right name.' 
line 24935=>     'First tell me whom you serve,' said Aragorn. 'Are you friend or foe of 
line 24936=>Sauron, the Dark Lord of Mordor?' 
line 24937=>     'I serve only the Lord  of the  Mark, Thjoden  King  son  of  Thengel,' 
line 24938=>answered Jomer. 'We do  not serve the Power of the Black Land far away,  but 
line 24939=>neither are we yet at open war with him; and  if you  are fleeing  from him, 
line 24940=>then you had best leave this  land. There is  trouble now on all our borders,  
line 24941=>and we are threatened; but we desire only to be free, and to live as we have 
line 24942=>lived, keeping  our  own, and  serving  no  foreign  lord,  good or evil. We 
line 24943=>welcomed guests kindly in the better days, but in  these  times the unbidden 
line 24944=>stranger finds us swift and hard. Come! Who are you?  Whom do you serve?  
line 24945=>At 
line 24946=>whose command do you hunt Orcs in our land?' 
line 24947=>     'I serve no man,' said  Aragorn;  'but the servants of  Sauron I pursue 
line 24948=>into whatever land they may go. There are few among mortal Men who know 
line 24949=>more 
line 24950=>of Orcs; and I do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. The Orcs whom 
line 24951=>we pursued  took captive two of my friends. In such need a man  that  has no  
line 24952=>horse  will go on foot, and he will  not ask for leave to  follow the trail. 
line 24953=>Nor will  he  count  the heads  of  the enemy save  with a  sword.  I am not 
line 24954=>weaponless.' 
line 24955=>     Aragorn  threw back his cloak. The elven-sheath glittered as he grasped 
line 24956=>it, and the bright blade of And®ril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it 
line 24957=>out.   'Elendil!'  he cried. 'I  am  Aragorn son  of Arathorn and  am  called 
line 24958=>Elessar, the Elfstone, D®nadan, the heir of Isildur Elendil's son of Gondor. 
line 24959=>Here is the Sword  that was  Broken and is forged again! Will you aid  me or 
line 24960=>thwart me? Choose swiftly!' 
line 24961=>     Gimli  and Legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had 
line 24962=>not seen him  in this  mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while 
line 24963=>
line 24964=>####-Jomer had shrunk; and in his  living face they caught a brief vision of  the  
line 24965=>power and majesty of the  kings  of stone. For a moment it seemed to the eyes 
line 24966=>of Legolas  that a white flame  flickered  on the  brows  of Aragorn  like a  
line 24967=>shining crown. 
line 24968=>     Jomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down  his 
line 24969=>proud  eyes.  'These  are  indeed  strange days,'  he  muttered. 'Dreams and 
line 24970=>legends spring to life out of the grass.  
line 24971=>     'Tell  me,  lord,' he said,  'what  brings you  here?  And what was the 
line 24972=>meaning  of the dark  words?  Long  has  Boromir  son of Denethor  been gone 
line 24973=>seeking an answer, and the  horse that we lent him  came back riderless. What 
line 24974=>doom do you bring out of the North?' 
line 24975=>     'The doom of choice,' said Aragorn. 'You may say this to Thjoden son of 
line 24976=>Thengel: open war lies before him, with Sauron or against him. None may live 
line 24977=>now as they ha ve lived, and few  shall keep what they call their own. But of 
line 24978=>these  great  matters we  will speak  later. If  chance allows, I will  come 
line 24979=>myself to the king. Now I am in great need, and I ask for help,  or at least  
line 24980=>for tidings. You heard that we are pursuing an orc-host that carried off our 
line 24981=>friends. What can you tell us?' 
line 24982=>     'That  you  need not  pursue  them further,' said Jomer. 'The  Orcs are 
line 24983=>destroyed.' 
line 24984=>     'And our friends?' 
line 24985=>     'We found none but Orcs.' 
line 24986=>     'But that is strange indeed,' said Aragorn. 'Did you search the  slain?  
line 24987=>Were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? They would be small. Only 
line 24988=>children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.' 
line 24989=>     'There  were no dwarves  nor children,' said Jomer. 'We counted all the 
line 24990=>slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as 
line 24991=>is our custom. The ashes are smoking still.' 
line 24992=>     'We do not speak of dwarves or children,' said Gimli. 'Our friends were 
line 24993=>hobbits.' 
line 24994=>     'Hobbits?' said Jomer. 'And what may they be? It is a strange name.' 
line 24995=>     'A strange name  for a strange folk,' said Gimli. 'But these were  very 
line 24996=>dear to us. It seems that you have heard in Rohan of the words that troubled  
line 24997=>Minas Tirith. They spoke of the Halfling. These hobbits are Halflings.' 
line 24998=>     'Halflings!' laughed the Rider that stood beside Jomer. 'Halflings! But 
line 24999=>they are  only  a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the 
line 25000=>North. Do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?' 
line 25001=>
line 25002=>####-     'A man may do both,' said Aragorn. 'For not we bu t those who come after  
line 25003=>will make the  legends  of  our time. The green earth, say you?  That  is  a  
line 25004=>mighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!' 
line 25005=>     'Time is  pressing,'  said the  Rider, not  heeding  Aragorn. 'We  must  
line 25006=>hasten south, lord. Let us leave these wild folk to their fancies. Or let us 
line 25007=>bind them and take them to the king.' 
line 25008=>     'Peace, Jothain!' said Jomer in his own tongue. 'Leave me a while. Tell 
line 25009=>the jored to assemble on the path' and make ready to ride to the Entwade. ' 
line 25010=>     Muttering Jothain retired, and spoke to  the others. Soon they drew off 
line 25011=>and left Jomer alone with the three companions. 
line 25012=>     'All  that you say  is strange,  Aragorn.' he said. 'Yet you speak  the 
line 25013=>truth, that is plain: the Men of the Mark do not lie, and therefore they are 
line 25014=>not easily deceived. But you have not told  all. Will you not now speak more 
line 25015=>fully of your errand, so that I may judge what to do?' 
line 25016=>     'I set out from Imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,' 
line 25017=>answered Aragorn.  'With me went Boromir of Minas Tirith. My errand was to 
line 25018=>go 
line 25019=>to that city with the son of Denethor,  to aid his folk in their war against 
line 25020=>Sauron. But the Company that I journeyed with had other  business. Of that I 
line 25021=>cannot speak now. Gandalf the Grey was our leader.' 
line 25022=>     'Gandalf!' Jomer exclaimed. 'Gandalf Greyhame is known in the Mark: but 
line 25023=>his name, I warn  you, is no longer a password to the king's favour.  He has 
line 25024=>been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, 
line 25025=>after  a season,  or  after  many  years. He is  ever the  herald of strange 
line 25026=>events: a bringer of evil, some now say. 
line 25027=>     'Indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss.  
line 25028=>At that  time our trouble with Saruman began. Until then we counted  Saruman 
line 25029=>our  friend,  hut Gandalf  came  then  and  warned us that  sudden  war  was 
line 25030=>preparing  in  Isengard.  He  said that  he himself had  been  a prisoner in 
line 25031=>Orthanc and had hardly escaped, and  he  begged  for help. But Thjoden would 
line 25032=>not listen to him, and he went away. Speak not the name of Gandalf loudly in 
line 25033=>Thjoden's ears! He is  wroth.  For  Gandalf took  the  horse  that is called 
line 25034=>Shadowfax, the most precious of all the king's steeds, chief  of the Mearas, 
line 25035=>which only the Lord of the Mark may ride. For the sire of their race was the 
line 25036=>great horse of Eorl that knew the speech of Men. Seven  nights ago Shadowfax 
line 25037=>returned; but  the king's  anger is not less, for  now the horse is wild and 
line 25038=>will let no man handle him.' 
line 25039=>
line 25040=>####-     'Then  Shadowfax  has found  his  way alone from  the far North,'  said 
line 25041=>Aragorn; 'for  it  was there that he and Gandalf  parted. But  alas! Gandalf 
line 25042=>will  ride no longer. He fell into darkness in the Mines  of Moria and comes 
line 25043=>not again.' 
line 25044=>     'That  is heavy  tidings,'  said Jomer.  'At least to  me, and to many; 
line 25045=>though not to all, as you may find, if you come to the king.' 
line 25046=>     'It  is  tidings more grievous than any in  this  land can  understand, 
line 25047=>though it may touch them  sorely  ere the year is much older,' said Aragorn. 
line 25048=>'But when  the great fall,  the less must lead. My  part it has been to guide 
line 25049=>our Company on the long  road from Moria. Through Lurien we came -- of 
line 25050=>which 
line 25051=>it were well that you should learn  the truth  ere you speak of it  again  -- 
line 25052=>and thence down the leagues of the Great River to the falls of Rauros. There 
line 25053=>Boromir was slain by the same Orcs whom you destroyed.' 
line 25054=>     'Your  news is all of woe!' cried Jomer in dismay. 'Great harm is  this 
line 25055=>death to  Minas  Tirith, and to us all. That was a worthy man! All spoke his 
line 25056=>praise.  He  came  seldom to the Mark, for he  was ever  in the wars on  the 
line 25057=>East -borders; but I have seen him. More like to the swift sons of Eorl  than 
line 25058=>to the  grave Men  of Gondor  he seemed  to me, and likely to  prove a great 
line 25059=>captain of  his  people when  his time came. But we have had no word of this 
line 25060=>grief out of Gondor. When did he fall?' 
line 25061=>     'It is now the fourth day since he was slain,' answered  Aragorn,  'and 
line 25062=>since the evening of  that day  we  have  journeyed from the shadow  of  Tol  
line 25063=>Brandir.' 
line 25064=>     'On foot?' cried Jomer. 
line 25065=>     'Yes, even as you see us.' 
line 25066=>     Wide wonder came into Jomer's eyes. 'Strider is too poor a name, son of 
line 25067=>Arathorn,' he  said. 'Wingfoot I name  you.  This deed of the  three friends 
line 25068=>should be sung in many a hall. Forty leagues and five  you have measured ere 
line 25069=>the fourth day is ended! Hardy is the race of Elendil! 
line 25070=>     'But  now, lord, what would you  have me do! I must return in  haste to 
line 25071=>Thjoden. I spoke warily  before  my  men. It is true that  we are not yet at 
line 25072=>open  war with the Black Land, and there are some, close to the  king's ear, 
line 25073=>that speak craven counsels; but war is coming. We shall  not forsake our old 
line 25074=>alliance  with Gondor, and while they fight we shall aid them: so say  I and 
line 25075=>all  who  hold  with me. The East-mark is my charge. the  ward  of  the Third 
line 25076=>Marshal, and I have  removed  all our  herds  and herdfolk, withdrawing them 
line 25077=>
line 25078=>####-beyond Entwash, and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts.' 
line 25079=>     'Then you do not pay tribute to Sauron?' said Gimli. 
line 25080=>     'We do not and we never have.'  said Jomer  with  a flash  of his eyes; 
line 25081=>'though it comes to my  ears that that lie has been told. Some years ago the 
line 25082=>Lord of the Black Land wished to  purchase horses of us at  great price, but 
line 25083=>we  refused him.  for he puts  beasts  to evil use. Then he sent  plundering 
line 25084=>Orcs, and  they carry  off what they can, choosing always the  black horses: 
line 25085=>few of these are now left. For that reason our feud with the Orcs is bitter. 
line 25086=>     'But at this  time our chief concern  is  with Saruman. He has  claimed 
line 25087=>lordship over  all this  land,  and there  has been war  between us for many 
line 25088=>months.  He has taken Orcs into his service,  and Wolf-riders, and evil Men,  
line 25089=>and he has closed the Gap against us, so that we are likely to be beset both 
line 25090=>east and west. 
line 25091=>     'It is ill dealing with such a  foe:  he  is a wizard both cunning  and 
line 25092=>dwimmer -crafty, having many guises. He walks here and there, they say, as an 
line 25093=>old  man hooded and cloaked, very like  to Gandalf, as many now recall.  His 
line 25094=>spies  slip  through every net, and his birds  of ill omen are abroad in the 
line 25095=>sky. I do not  know how it will all end, and  my heart  misgives me;  for it 
line 25096=>seems to  me that his friends do not all dwell in Isengard. But  if you come 
line 25097=>to the king's  house, you shall see for  yourself. Will  you not come? Do  I 
line 25098=>hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need?' 
line 25099=>     'I will come when I may,' said Aragorn. 
line 25100=>     'Come now!' said Jomer. 'The Heir of Elendil would be a strength indeed 
line 25101=>to the  Sons of Eorl  in this evil tide.  There  is battle even  now upon the 
line 25102=>Westemnet, and I fear that it may go ill for us. 
line 25103=>     'Indeed in this riding north I went without the king's leave, for in my 
line 25104=>absence his  house  is left with little guard. But scouts warned me  of  the 
line 25105=>orc-host coming down out of the East  Wall  three nights ago, and among them 
line 25106=>they reported that some bore the white badges of Saruman. So suspecting what 
line 25107=>I  most fear, a league between  Orthanc  and  the Dark Tower, I led forth my 
line 25108=>jored,  men of  my own household; and  we overtook the Orcs at nightfall two 
line 25109=>days  ago, near to the borders of the Entwood. There we surrounded them, and 
line 25110=>gave battle yesterday at dawn. Fifteen of my men  I lost, and  twelve horses 
line 25111=>alas! For the  Orcs were greater in number than we counted on. Others joined 
line 25112=>them. coming out of the East across the Great River: their trail is plain to 
line 25113=>see a little north of this spot.  And  others, too, came out  of the forest. 
line 25114=>Great Orcs, who  also bore the White Hand of Isengard: that kind is stronger  
line 25115=>
line 25116=>####-and more fell than all  others.  
line 25117=>     'Nonetheless we put an end to them.  But we have been too long away. We 
line 25118=>are needed south and west. Will you not come? There are  spare horses as you  
line 25119=>see. There is work for  the  Sword to do.  Yes, and we could find a  use for 
line 25120=>Gimli's axe  and  the bow of Legolas, if  they  will  pardon  my  rash  words 
line 25121=>concerning  the Lady of the Wood. I spoke only as do all men in my land, and 
line 25122=>I would gladly learn better.' 
line 25123=>     'I thank you for your fair words,' said Aragorn, 'and  my heart desires 
line 25124=>to come with you; but I cannot desert my friends while hope remains.' 
line 25125=>     'Hope does not remain,'  said Jomer. 'You will not find your friends on 
line 25126=>the North-borders.' 
line 25127=>     'Yet my friends are not behind. We found a clear token not far from the 
line 25128=>East Wall that one  at least of  them was still alive there. But between the 
line 25129=>wall and the downs  we  have found no  other trace of them, and no trail has 
line 25130=>turned aside, this way or that, unless my skill has wholly left me.' 
line 25131=>     'Then what do you think has become of them?' 
line 25132=>     'I do not know. They may have been slain and burned among the Orcs; but 
line 25133=>that you  will say  cannot be, and I do not fear it. I  can only think  that 
line 25134=>they were  carried off into the forest before the  battle,  even  before you  
line 25135=>encircled your foes, maybe. Can you swear that none escaped your net in such 
line 25136=>a way?' 
line 25137=>     'I would swear that no Orc  escaped after we sighted them,' said Jomer. 
line 25138=>'We reached the forest -eaves before them, and if after that any living thing 
line 25139=>broke through our ring, then it was no Orc and had some elvish power.' 
line 25140=>     'Our  friends  were  attired  even as we  are,' said Aragorn; 'and  you  
line 25141=>passed us by under the full light of day.' 
line 25142=>     'I had forgotten that,' said Jomer. 'It is  hard to be sure of anything 
line 25143=>among  so many  marvels. The  world is  all grown strange. Elf and Dwarf  in 
line 25144=>company walk in our daily  fields; and folk speak with the  Lady of the Wood 
line 25145=>and yet live; and the Sword comes  back to war  that was broken in  the long 
line 25146=>ages  ere  the  fathers of our fathers rode into the Mark!  How  shall a man 
line 25147=>judge what to do in such times?' 
line 25148=>     'As he ever has judged,' said Aragorn.  'Good and  ill have not changed 
line 25149=>since  yesteryear;  nor  are  they one thing among  Elves and  Dwarves µ and 
line 25150=>another among Men. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden 
line 25151=>Wood as in his own house.' 
line 25152=>     'True indeed,' said Jomer. 'But I do not doubt you, nor the  deed which 
line 25153=>
line 25154=>####-my heart would do. Yet I am not free to do all as I would. It is against our 
line 25155=>law to let strangers wander  at  will  in our land, until the  king  himself 
line 25156=>shall  give them leave,  and  more strict is  the command in  these days  of 
line 25157=>peril. I have begged you to come back willingly with  me, and you will  not.  
line 25158=>Loth am I to begin a battle of one hundred against three.' 
line 25159=>     'I do not  think your law was  made  for such a chance,' said  Aragorn. 
line 25160=>'Nor  indeed am I a stranger; for I have been in this land before, more than 
line 25161=>once,  and ridden with the host of the Rohirrim, though under other name and 
line 25162=>in other guise. You  I have  not seen before,  for you are young, but I have 
line 25163=>spoken with Jomund your father, and with Thjoden  son  of Thengel.  Never in 
line 25164=>former days  would  any high lord of  this land  have  constrained a man  to 
line 25165=>abandon such a quest as mine. My duty at least is clear, to go on. Come now, 
line 25166=>son of Jomund, the choice must be made at last. Aid us,  or at the worst let 
line 25167=>us go free. Or seek to carry  out your law. If you do so there will be fewer  
line 25168=>to return to your war or to your king.' 
line 25169=>     Jomer was silent for a  moment,  then he  spoke. 'We both have need  of 
line 25170=>haste,' he said. 'My  company chafes to be away, and every hour lessens your 
line 25171=>hope. This  is my choice.  You  may go;  and  what  is more, I will lend you  
line 25172=>horses. This  only I ask: when  your quest is achieved, or  is  proved vain, 
line 25173=>return  with  the horses over the  Entwade  to Meduseld,  the high house  in 
line 25174=>Edoras  where Thjoden now sits. Thus you shall prove to him that I  have not 
line 25175=>misjudged. In this I place myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of 
line 25176=>your good faith. Do not fail.' 
line 25177=>     'I will not,' said Aragorn. 
line 25178=>     There  was great wonder, and many dark  and doubtful glances, among his 
line 25179=>men, when Jomer gave orders that  the  spare horses were to be  lent to  the 
line 25180=>strangers; but only Jothain dared to speak openly. 
line 25181=>     'It  may be  well enough  for this lord  of the race of Gondor,  as  he 
line 25182=>claims,' he said, 'but who has heard of a horse of the Mark being given to a  
line 25183=>Dwarf?' 
line 25184=>     'No one,' said Gimli. 'And do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it. 
line 25185=>I would sooner  walk  than si t  on the back  of any beast so great,  free or 
line 25186=>begrudged.' 
line 25187=>     'But you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said Aragorn. 
line 25188=>     'Come, you shall sit  behind me, friend  Gimli, said Legolas.  Then all 
line 25189=>will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.' 
line 25190=>     A great dark-grey horse  was  brought to  Aragorn, and  he  mounted it. 
line 25191=>
line 25192=>####-'Hasufel is  his name,'  said  Jomer.  'May he bear  you well and to  better  
line 25193=>fortune than Gbrulf, his late master!' 
line 25194=>     A  smaller and lighter  horse, but  restive and fiery,  was brought  to 
line 25195=>Legolas. Arod was his  name.  But Legolas asked them to take  off saddle and 
line 25196=>rein. 'I need them not,' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder  
line 25197=>Arod was  tame and willing  beneath  him, moving  here and there  with but a 
line 25198=>spoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts.  Gimli was lifted 
line 25199=>up behind  his friend. and  he clung to him, not much more at ease than  Sam 
line 25200=>Gamgee in a boat. 
line 25201=>     'Farewell, and may you find what  you  seek!' cried Jomer. 'Return with 
line 25202=>what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!' 
line 25203=>     'I will come,' said Aragorn. 
line 25204=>     'And I will come, too,' said Gimli. 'The matter  of the  Lady Galadriel 
line 25205=>lies still between us. I have yet to teach you gentle speech. ' 
line 25206=>     'We  shall see,' said Jomer. 'So many strange things  have chanced that 
line 25207=>to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a Dwarf's axe 
line 25208=>will seem no great wonder. Farewell!' 
line 25209=>     With that they parted.  Very swift were the horses of Rohan. When aft er 
line 25210=>a little Gimli looked back, the company of Jomer were  already small and far 
line 25211=>away. Aragorn did not look  back: he was watching the  trail as they sped on 
line 25212=>their way, bending low with his head beside the neck of Hasufel. Before long 
line 25213=>they came to the  borders of the Entwash, and there they met the other trail 
line 25214=>of which Jomer had spoken, coming down from the East out of the Wold. 
line 25215=>     Aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then  leaping back into the  
line 25216=>saddle, he rode  away for  some distance  eastward, keeping to one side  and 
line 25217=>taking care not  to override  the footprints. Then he again  dismounted  and 
line 25218=>examined the ground, going backwards and forwards on foot. 
line 25219=>     'There  is  little  to  discover,'  he said when he returned. 'The main 
line 25220=>trail is all confused with the passage of  the  horsemen  as they came back; 
line 25221=>their outward  course  must have lain nearer  the river. But  this  eastward 
line 25222=>trail is fresh and clear. There is no sign there of any feet going the other  
line 25223=>way, back towards  Anduin. Now  we  must ride slower, and make sure  that no 
line 25224=>trace or footstep branches off on either side. The Orcs must have been aware 
line 25225=>from this point that they were  pursued; they may have made some  attempt to 
line 25226=>get their captives away before they were overtaken.' 
line 25227=>     As they rode forward the  day  was overcast.  Low grey clouds came over  
line 25228=>the  Wold.  A  mist  shrouded the sun. Ever nearer  the  tree-clad slopes of 
line 25229=>
line 25230=>####-Fangorn loomed, slowly darkling as the sun  went west. They  saw no  sign of 
line 25231=>any  trail to  right or  left, but here  a nd  there they passed single Orcs,  
line 25232=>fallen in  their tracks as they  ran, with grey-feathered arrows sticking in 
line 25233=>back or throat. 
line 25234=>     At  last  as the  afternoon was  waning they came  to  the eaves of the 
line 25235=>forest, and in  an open  glade among the first trees they found the place of 
line 25236=>the great burning:  the ashes were  still hot  and smoking. Beside it was  a  
line 25237=>great pile of  helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords,  bows  and 
line 25238=>darts  and other gear of war. Upon  a stake in  the  middle was set a  great 
line 25239=>goblin head;  upon its shattered helm the  white badge could  still be seen. 
line 25240=>Further away, not far from the river, where  it  came streaming out from the 
line 25241=>edge of  the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw earth was 
line 25242=>covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted fifteen spears.  
line 25243=>     Aragorn and  his  companions  searched far and wide about  the field of 
line 25244=>battle,  but  the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. By 
line 25245=>nightfall they had discovered no trace of Merry and Pippin. 
line 25246=>     'We can  do no more,' said Gimli sadly. 'We have been set  many riddles 
line 25247=>since we  came to Tol Brandir, but this  is the hardest to  unravel. I would 
line 25248=>guess  that the burned bones of  the hobbits are now mingled with the Orcs'.  
line 25249=>It will be hard news for Frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the 
line 25250=>old hobbit who waits in Rivendell. Elrond was against their coming.' 
line 25251=>     'But Gandalf was not,' said Legolas.  
line 25252=>     'But Gandalf chose  to come himself, and he was the first to be  lost ' 
line 25253=>answered Gimli. 'His foresight failed him.' 
line 25254=>     'The counsel of Gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for  
line 25255=>himself  or for  others,' said Aragorn. 'There are some  things that  it  is 
line 25256=>better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark. But I shall 
line 25257=>not  depart  from  this  place yet.  In  any  case  we  must  here await the 
line 25258=>morning-light.' 
line 25259=>     A little way  beyond  the battle-field they  made  their  camp under  a  
line 25260=>spreading tree: it looked  like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad 
line 25261=>brown leaves  of a former year,  like dry  hands with long splayed  fingers;  
line 25262=>they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze. 
line 25263=>     Gimli shivered. They had brought only one blanket apiece. 'Let us light 
line 25264=>a fire,'  he said. 'I  care  no longer for the  danger. Let the Orcs come as 
line 25265=>thick as summer-moths round a candle!' 
line 25266=>     'If those  unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it  might draw them 
line 25267=>
line 25268=>####-hither,' said Legolas.  
line 25269=>     'And it might draw other things, neither Orc nor Hobbit,' said Aragorn. 
line 25270=>'We are  near to the mountain-marches of the traitor Saruman. Also we are on 
line 25271=>the  very edge of Fangorn,  and  it is  perilous to touch  the trees of that 
line 25272=>wood, it is said.' 
line 25273=>     'But  the Rohirrim  made a  great burning here yesterday,'  said Gimli, 
line 25274=>'and  they felled  trees for the fire, as can be seen.  Yet they passed  the 
line 25275=>night after safely here, when their labour was ended.' 
line 25276=>     'They were  many,' said  Aragorn,  'and they  do not heed the wrath  of 
line 25277=>Fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under  the trees. But 
line 25278=>our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. So have a care!  
line 25279=>Cut no living wood!' 
line 25280=>     'There  is no need,' said  Gimli. 'The Riders have  left chip and bough 
line 25281=>enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.' He went off to gather fuel, 
line 25282=>and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but Aragorn sat silent 
line 25283=>with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and Legolas stood alone in 
line 25284=>the open, looking towards the profound  shadow of the wood, leaning forward, 
line 25285=>as one who listens to voices calling from a distance. 
line 25286=>     When the  Dwarf had  a  small bright blaze going, the three  companions 
line 25287=>drew close  to  it and sat together,  shrouding  the light with their hooded 
line 25288=>forms. Legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them.  
line 25289=>     'Look!' he said. 'The tree is glad of the fire!' 
line 25290=>     It  may  have  been  that the dancing  shadows tricked their eyes,  but 
line 25291=>certainly to each  of the companions the  boughs appeared to be bending this 
line 25292=>way and that so as to come  above the flames, wh ile  the upper branches were 
line 25293=>stooping down; the brown  leaves  now stood  out  stiff, and rubbed together  
line 25294=>like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth. 
line 25295=>     There was a silence, for suddenly the dark  and unknown forest, so near 
line 25296=>at hand,  made  itself  felt  as  a great  brooding presence, full  of secret 
line 25297=>purpose. After a while Legolas spoke again. 
line 25298=>     'Celeborn warned us not to go far into Fangorn,' he said. 'Do you  know 
line 25299=>why, Aragorn? What are the fables of the forest that Boromir had heard?' 
line 25300=>     'I have heard many  tales  in Gondor and elsewhere,' said Aragorn, 'but 
line 25301=>if it were not for the words of Celeborn I should deem them only fables that 
line 25302=>Men have made as true knowledge fades. I had thought of  asking you what 
line 25303=>was 
line 25304=>the truth of the  matter . And if an Elf of the Wood does not know, how shall  
line 25305=>
line 25306=>####-a Man answer?' 
line 25307=>     'You  have  journeyed  further  than  I,'  said Legolas. 'I  have heard 
line 25308=>nothing of this in my own land, save only songs that  tell how the  Onodrim,  
line 25309=>that Men  call Ents,  dwelt there  long ago; for Fangorn is old, old  even as 
line 25310=>the Elves would reckon it.' 
line 25311=>     'Yes,  it  is  old,'  said  Aragorn,  'as  old  as the  forest  by  the 
line 25312=>Barrow-downs, and it is  far greater. Elrond says that the two are akin, the 
line 25313=>last  strongholds  of  the  mighty  woods of the  Elder Days, in  which  the  
line 25314=>Firstborn roamed while Men still slept. Yet Fangorn holds some secret of its 
line 25315=>own. What it is I do not know.' 
line 25316=>     'And  I  do not wish to know,' said Gimli. 'Let nothing that  dwells in 
line 25317=>Fangorn be troubled on my account!' 
line 25318=>     They  now drew  lots for the watches, and the lot for  the first  watch 
line 25319=>fell to Gimli. The others lay down. Almost at once sleep laid hold  on them. 
line 25320=>'Gimli!' said  Aragorn drowsily. 'Remember, it is perilous  to  cut bough or  
line 25321=>twig from  a living tree  in Fangorn. But do not stray far in search of dead 
line 25322=>wood. Let the fire die rather! Call me at need!' 
line 25323=>     With  that  he  fell asleep.  Legolas already lay motionless, his  fair 
line 25324=>hands folded upon  his breast,  his eyes unclosed, blending living night and 
line 25325=>deep dream, as is the way with Elves. Gimli sat hunched by the fire, running 
line 25326=>his thumb  thoughtfully along  the edge of  his axe. The tree rustled. There 
line 25327=>was no other sound. 
line 25328=>     Suddenly  Gimli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light 
line 25329=>stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his 
line 25330=>wide-brimmed hat was pulled  down over his eyes. Gimli sprang up, too 
line 25331=>amazed 
line 25332=>for the moment to  cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind  
line 25333=>that Saruman had caught them. Both Aragorn and Legolas, roused by his 
line 25334=>sudden 
line 25335=>movement, sat up and stared. The old man did not speak or make, sign. 
line 25336=>     'Well, father,  what can we do  for you?'  said Aragorn, leaping to his 
line 25337=>feet. 'Come and be warm, if you are cold!'  He strode  forward, but the  old 
line 25338=>man was gone. There  was  no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they 
line 25339=>did not dare to wander far. The moon had set and the night was very dark. 
line 25340=>     Suddenly Legolas gave a cry. 'The horses! The horses!' 
line 25341=>     The horses wer e gone.  They had dragged their pickets and  disappeared.  
line 25342=>For  me time the three companions stood still  and silent, troubled  by this 
line 25343=>
line 25344=>####-new stroke of ill fortune. They were under the eaves of Fangorn, and endless 
line 25345=>leagues lay  between them and the Men of  Rohan,  their only friends in this 
line 25346=>wide  and dangerous land. As they stood, it seemed to  them that they heard,  
line 25347=>far off in the night. the sound of horses whinnying and  neighing. Then  all 
line 25348=>was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind. 
line 25349=>     'Well, they are gone,' said  Aragorn at last. 'We cannot  find  them or  
line 25350=>catch  them;  so that  if they do not return of their  own will, we must  do 
line 25351=>without. We started on our feet, and we have those still.' 
line 25352=>     'Feet!' said Gimli. 'But we cannot eat them as well  as walk on  them ' 
line 25353=>He threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it. 
line 25354=>     'Only a few hours ago  you were unwilling  to sit on a horse of Rohan,' 
line 25355=>laughed Legolas. 'You will make a rider yet.' 
line 25356=>     'It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance,' said Gimli. 
line 25357=>     'If you wish  to know what I think,'  he began  again after  a while 'I  
line 25358=>think it was Saruman. Who else? Remember  the words of Jomer: he walks 
line 25359=>about 
line 25360=>like an old man hooded and cloaked. Those were  the words.  He has gone  off 
line 25361=>with our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. There is more trouble 
line 25362=>coming to us, mark my words!' 
line 25363=>     'I mark them,' said Aragorn. 'But I marked also that this old man had a  
line 25364=>hat not a hood. Still I do not  doubt that  you guess right, and that we are 
line 25365=>in peril here, by night or day. Yet in the meantime there is nothing that we 
line 25366=>can do but  rest, while we may. I will  watch for a while now, Gimli. I have 
line 25367=>more need of thought than of sleep.' 
line 25368=>     The night  passed  slowly. Legolas followed Aragorn, and Gimli followed 
line 25369=>Legolas, and their watches wore away. But nothing  happened. The old man did 
line 25370=>not appear again, and the horses did not return. 
line 25371=> 
line 25372=>
line 25373=>####- 
line 25374=>
line 25375=>Chapter 3. The Uruk-Hai 
line 25376=>
line 25377=> 
line 25378=> 
line 25379=>     Pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream:  it seemed that he could  hear 
line 25380=>his own small  vo ice  echoing in black tunnels,  calling  Frodo, Frodo!  But 
line 25381=>instead of Frodo hundreds of hideous  orc-faces grinned  at  him  out of the 
line 25382=>shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from  every side. Where 
line 25383=>was 
line 25384=>Merry? 
line 25385=>     He  woke. Cold air blew on his  face. He was lying on his back. Evening  
line 25386=>was coming and  the sky above was growing dim. He turned and found that  the 
line 25387=>dream  was little worse than  the  waking. His wrists, legs, and ankles were 
line 25388=>tied with cords.  Beside him Merry lay,  white-faced, with a  dirty rag bound  
line 25389=>across his brows. All about them sat or stood a great company of Orcs. 
line 25390=>     Slowly in Pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became 
line 25391=>separated from dream-shadows. Of course: he and  Merry had run off into  the 
line 25392=>woods. What had come over them? Why had they dashed off like that, taking 
line 25393=>no 
line 25394=>notice  of  old  Strider? They  had  run a  long  way shouting--he could not 
line 25395=>remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed  right into 
line 25396=>a  group  of Orcs: they  were standing listening, and they did not appear to 
line 25397=>see Merry and Pippin until they were  almost in their arms. Then they yelled 
line 25398=>and  dozens of other goblins had sprung out  of the  trees. Merry and he had 
line 25399=>drawn their swords, but the  Orcs did not wish to fight, and had tried  only 
line 25400=>to lay  hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several  of their arms and 
line 25401=>hands. Good old Merry!  
line 25402=>     Then  Boromir  had come  leaping through  the  trees. He had made  them 
line 25403=>fight. He slew many of them and the rest fled.  But they had not gone far on  
line 25404=>the way back when they were attacked again. by a hundred Orcs at least, some 
line 25405=>of  them very large, and they shot  a rain of  arrows:  always  at  Boromir. 
line 25406=>Boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang,  and at first the Orcs 
line 25407=>had  been dismayed and  had  drawn back; but when no  answer but the  echoes 
line 25408=>came, they had attacked more fierce  than ever. Pippin did not remember much 
line 25409=>more.  His last memo was of Boromir  leaning against a tree, plucking out an 
line 25410=>arrow; then darkness fell suddenly. 
line 25411=>     'I suppose I was knocked on the head,' he said to himself. 'I wonder if 
line 25412=>
line 25413=>####-poor Merry is much hurt. What has happened to  Boromir? Why  didn't the 
line 25414=>Orcs 
line 25415=>kill us? Where are we, and where are we going?' 
line 25416=>     He could  not  answer the questions. He felt  cold and  sick.  'I  wish 
line 25417=>Gandalf  had never persuaded Elrond to let  us come,' he thought. 'What good 
line 25418=>have I been? Just a  nuisance: a  passenger, a piece  of luggage. And now  I 
line 25419=>have been stolen  and I am  just  a piece of  luggage for the  Orcs.  I hope 
line 25420=>Strider or someone will come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won't 
line 25421=>that throw out all the plans? I wish I could get free!' 
line 25422=>     He  struggled  a little, quite  uselessly. One of the Orcs sitting near 
line 25423=>laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable  tongue. 'Rest  
line 25424=>while  you  can, little fool!' he said then to Pippin, in the Common Speech, 
line 25425=>which he made almost  as hideous as  his own language.  'Rest while you can!  
line 25426=>We'll find  a use for your  legs before  long. You'll wish you had  got none 
line 25427=>before we get home.' 
line 25428=>     'If I had my way, you'd  wish you  were dead now,' said the other. 'I'd 
line 25429=>make you squeak,  you miserable rat.' He stooped over  Pippin  bringing  his 
line 25430=>yellow fangs close to his face.  He had  a  black  knife  with a long jagged 
line 25431=>blade  in  his hand.  'Lie quiet, or  I'll tickle you with this,' he hissed. 
line 25432=>'Don't  draw attention  to yourself,  or  I may forget my orders.  Curse the 
line 25433=>Isengarders! Ugl®k  u  bagronk sha  pushdug Saruman -glob  b®bhosh skai':   
line 25434=>he 
line 25435=>passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into 
line 25436=>muttering and snarling. 
line 25437=>     Terrified  Pippin lay still, though the pain at  his wrists  and ankles 
line 25438=>was  growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back.  To take 
line 25439=>his mind off himself he listened intently to all that  he could  hear. There 
line 25440=>were many  voices round about, and though orc-speech  sounded  at all  times 
line 25441=>full  of hate and anger, it  seemed plain  that something like a quarrel had 
line 25442=>begun, and was getting hotter. 
line 25443=>     To Pippin's  surpr ise he  found that much of the  talk was intelligible 
line 25444=>many of the Orcs were using ordinary language. Apparently the members of 
line 25445=>two 
line 25446=>or three quite different tribes  were present, and they could not understand 
line 25447=>one another's orc-speech. There  was  an angry  debate concerning  what they 
line 25448=>were to do now: which way they were to take and what should be done with the 
line 25449=>prisoners. 
line 25450=>
line 25451=>####-     'There's no time to kill them properly,' said one. 'No time for play on 
line 25452=>this trip.' 
line 25453=>     'That  can't  be helped,' said another. 'But why not kill  them  quick, 
line 25454=>kill them  now? They're  a cursed  nuisance, and we're in a hurry. Evening's 
line 25455=>coming on, and we ought to get a move on.' 
line 25456=>     'Orders.' said a third  voice in  a  deep growl. 'Kill all but  NOT the 
line 25457=>Halfings;  they are to be brought back ALIVE  as quickly as possible . That's 
line 25458=>my orders.' 
line 25459=>     'What are they wanted for?'  asked  several voices. 'Why alive? Do they 
line 25460=>give good sport?' 
line 25461=>     'No!  I  heard that  one of them has  got something,  something  that's 
line 25462=>wanted for  the  War,  some   elvish plot  or other.  Anyway they'll both  be 
line 25463=>questioned.' 
line 25464=>     'Is that all you know? Why don't  we search them and find out? We might  
line 25465=>find something that we could use ourselves.' 
line 25466=>     'That is a very interesting remark,' sneered a  voice,  softer than the 
line 25467=>others but more evil. 'I may have to report that. The prisoners  are  NOT to 
line 25468=>be searched or plundered: those are my orders.' 
line 25469=>     'And  mine  too,'  said  the  deep  voice. 'Alive and as  captured;  no 
line 25470=>spoiling. That's my orders.' 
line 25471=>     'Not our order s!' said one of the earlier voices. 'We have come all the 
line 25472=>way from the Mines to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go 
line 25473=>back north.' 
line 25474=>     'Then you can wish  again,' said the  growling voice. 'I  am  Ugl®k.  I 
line 25475=>command. I return to Isengard by the shortest road.' 
line 25476=>     'Is Saruman the  master  or the Great Eye?'  said the  evil  voice. 'We 
line 25477=>should go back at once to Lugb®rz.' 
line 25478=>     'If we could cross the Great River, we might,' said another voice. 'But 
line 25479=>there are not enough of us to venture down to the bridges.' 
line 25480=>     'I came  across,'  said  the evil  voice.  'A winged  Nazgyl awaits  us 
line 25481=>northward on the east -bank.' 
line 25482=>     'Maybe, maybe! Then you'll fly off with our prisoners, and get  all the 
line 25483=>pay and praise in Lugb®rz,  and leave  us to foot it as best we  can through 
line 25484=>the Horse-country.  No, we must  stick together.  These lands are dangerous:  
line 25485=>full of foul rebels and brigands.' 
line 25486=>     'Aye, we must stick together,' growled Ugl®k. 'I don't trust you little 
line 25487=>swine. You've no guts outside your own sties. But for us you'd all  have run 
line 25488=>
line 25489=>####-away. We are the fighting  Uruk-hai! We slew the  great warrior. We took the 
line 25490=>prisoners. We are the servants of Saruman the Wise, the White Hand: the Hand 
line 25491=>that gives us man's-flesh to eat. We came out of Isengard, and led you here, 
line 25492=>and we shall lead you back by the way we choose. I am Ugl®k. I have spoken.' 
line 25493=>     'You have  spoken more than enough,  Ugl®k,' sneered the evil voice. 'I  
line 25494=>wonder how  they would like  it  in  Lugb®rz. They might think  that Ugl®k's 
line 25495=>shoulders  needed relieving  of a  swollen head. They might  ask  where  his 
line 25496=>strange ideas came  from. Did they come  from Saruman, perhaps? Who  does 
line 25497=>he 
line 25498=>think he is, setting up on his own with his  filthy white badges? They might 
line 25499=>agree with me, with  Grishnbkh their trusted messenger; and I  Grishnbkh say 
line 25500=>this: Saruman is a fool. and a dirty treacherous fool. But the  Great Eye is 
line 25501=>on him. 
line 25502=>     'Swine  is  it? How  do  you  folk  like  being  called  swine  by  the 
line 25503=>muck -rakers  of  a  dirty  little  wizard?  It's  orc-flesh  they  eat, I'll 
line 25504=>warrant.' 
line 25505=>     Many loud yells  in orc-speech  answered him, and the ringing  clash of 
line 25506=>weapons being drawn. Cautiously Pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would 
line 25507=>happen.  His guards had gone to  join in the  fray. In the twilight he saw a  
line 25508=>large  black  Orc,  probably  Ugl®k,  standing  facing  Grishnbkh,  a  short 
line 25509=>crook -legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the 
line 25510=>ground. Round  them  were many smaller  goblins. Pippin supposed that  these 
line 25511=>were the ones from the  North. They had drawn  their knives and swords,  but 
line 25512=>hesitated to attack Ugl®k. 
line 25513=>     Ugl®k  shouted, and a  number of other Orcs of  nearly his own size ran 
line 25514=>up. Then suddenly, without  warning, Ugl®k sprang  forwards,  and  with  two 
line 25515=>swift strokes swept  the heads  off two of his opponents.  Grishnbkh stepped 
line 25516=>aside and  vanished  into the  shadows. The others gave way, and one stepped 
line 25517=>backwards  and fell  over Merry's  prostrate  form with  a  curse. Yet  that 
line 25518=>probably saved his life, for Ugl®k's followers leaped over him and  cut down 
line 25519=>another with their broad-bladed swords. It was the yellow-fanged  guard. His 
line 25520=>body fell right on top of Pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife. 
line 25521=>     'Put up your weapons!' shouted Ugl®k. 'And let's have no more nonsense! 
line 25522=>We go straight west  from here, and down the stair.  From  there straight to 
line 25523=>the  downs, then along the  river to the forest. And we march day and night. 
line 25524=>That clear?' 
line 25525=>     'Now,' thought  Pippin,  'if  only it takes  that ugly  fellow a little 
line 25526=>
line 25527=>####-while to get his  troop under control, I've got  a chance.' A gleam of  hope 
line 25528=>had come to him. The edge  of the black knife had snicked his arm, and  then 
line 25529=>slid down to his wrist.  He  felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he 
line 25530=>also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin. 
line 25531=>     The Orcs were getting ready to march again, but some of the Northerners 
line 25532=>were still unwilling, and the Isengarders slew two more before the rest were 
line 25533=>cowed.  There  was  much  cursing  and confusion. For  the moment Pippin was 
line 25534=>unwatched. His legs were  securely bound, but his arms were  only tied about 
line 25535=>the wrists,  and his hands were  in front  of  him. He could  move them both 
line 25536=>together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead Orc to one 
line 25537=>side, then hardly daring to  breathe, he drew the  knot of the wrist -cord up 
line 25538=>and down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held 
line 25539=>it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers and knotted  
line 25540=>it again into a loose  bracelet of two loops and slipped it  over his hands.  
line 25541=>Then he lay very still. 
line 25542=>     'Pick up those prisoners!' shouted Ugl®k.  'Don't play any  tricks with 
line 25543=>them! If they are not alive when we get back, someone else will die too.' 
line 25544=>     An Orc  seized Pippin like a sack. put its head between his tied hands,  
line 25545=>grabbed his arms and  dragged them  down, until  Pippin's  face was  crushed 
line 25546=>against its neck; then it jolted off  with him. Another treated Merry in the 
line 25547=>same way. The Orc's clawlike hand gripped Pippin's arms like iron; the nails 
line 25548=>bit into him. He shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams.  
line 25549=>     Suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was early night, 
line 25550=>but the  slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the  edge of a 
line 25551=>cliff that seemed to look out  over a sea of pale mist. There was a sound of 
line 25552=>water falling nearby. 
line 25553=>     'The scouts have come back at last,' said an Orc close at hand. 
line 25554=>     'Well, what did you discover?' growled the voice of Ugl®k. 
line 25555=>     'Only a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All's clear now.' 
line 25556=>     'Now,  I  daresay. But how  long? You fools! You should  have shot him.  
line 25557=>He'll  raise the alarm. The cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning. 
line 25558=>Now we'll have to leg it double quick.' 
line 25559=>     A shadow bent over  Pippin. It  was Ugl®k. 'Sit up! ' said the  Orc. 'My 
line 25560=>lads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down and you  must  
line 25561=>use your legs. Be  helpful now. No  crying out, no trying to escape. We have 
line 25562=>ways of paying for tricks that you won't like, though they won't spoil  your 
line 25563=>usefulness for the Master.' 
line 25564=>
line 25565=>####-     He cut the thongs round Pippin's legs and ankles, picked him  up by his 
line 25566=>hair  and stood him  on his feet. Pippin fell down, and Ugl®k dragged him up 
line 25567=>by  his hair again. Several Orcs  laughed. Ugl®k thrust a  flask between his 
line 25568=>teeth and poured some burning liquid down  his  throat: he felt a hot fierce 
line 25569=>glow  flow through  him.  The pain in his legs and ankles vanished. He could 
line 25570=>stand. 
line 25571=>     'Now for  the other!' said Ugl®k.  Pippin saw him go  to Merry, who was 
line 25572=>lying  close  by,  and kick  him. Merry groaned.  Seizing him roughly  Ugl®k 
line 25573=>pulled  him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. Then 
line 25574=>he smeared the wound with some dark  stuff out of a small wooden  box. Merry 
line 25575=>cried out and struggled wildly. 
line 25576=>     The Orcs clapped and  hooted. 'Can't take his medicine,'  they  jeered. 
line 25577=>'Doesn't know what's good for him. Ai! We shall have some fun later.' 
line 25578=>     But  at the moment Ugl®k was not engaged in  sport. He needed speed and 
line 25579=>had to humour  unwilling followers. He was healing Merry in orc-fashion; and 
line 25580=>his treatment worked swiftly. When he had forced a drink from his flask down 
line 25581=>the  hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to  his feet, Merry 
line 25582=>stood up, looking pale but grim  and defiant, and very  much alive. The gash 
line 25583=>in his forehead gave him  no  more trouble, but he bore a  brown scar to the 
line 25584=>end of his days.  
line 25585=>     'Hullo, Pippin!' he said.  'So you've come on  this  little expedition, 
line 25586=>too? Where do we get bed and breakfast?' 
line 25587=>     'Now then!' said Ugl®k.  'None of that!  Hold your tongues. No  talk to 
line 25588=>one another. Any  trouble will be  reported at the other end, and He'll know 
line 25589=>how to pay  you. You'll  get bed and breakfast  all right: more than you can 
line 25590=>stomach.' 
line 25591=>     The orc-band  began to descend a  narrow ravine  leading down into  the 
line 25592=>misty plain below.  Merry and  Pippin,  separated by a  dozen  Orcs or more, 
line 25593=>climbed down with  them. At the  bottom  they  stepped on to  grass, and the 
line 25594=>hearts of the hobbits rose. 
line 25595=>     'Now  straight on!'  shouted Ugl®k. 'West  and a  little  north. Follow 
line 25596=>Lugdush.' 
line 25597=>     'But what are we going to do at sunrise?' said some of the Northerners.  
line 25598=>     'Go on running,' said Ugl®k. 'What do you think? Sit  on the  grass and 
line 25599=>wait for the Whiteskins to join the picnic?' 
line 25600=>     'But we can't run in the sunlight.' 
line 25601=>     'You'll run with me  behind you,' said Ugl®k. 'Run! Or you'll never see 
line 25602=>
line 25603=>####-your beloved  holes again. By  the White Hand! What's the use of sending out 
line 25604=>mountain-maggots  on  a trip, only half trained. Run, curse  you! Run  while 
line 25605=>night lasts!' 
line 25606=>     Then the whole  company  began to  run  with the long loping strides of 
line 25607=>Orcs. They kept  no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed 
line 25608=>was very great. Each hobbit had a guard of three. Pippin was far back in the 
line 25609=>line. He  wondered how long he would be able to  go on at this pace: he  had 
line 25610=>had no food since the morning. One of  his guards had a whip. But at present 
line 25611=>the orc-liquor was still hot in him. His wits, too, were wide-awake. 
line 25612=>     Every now and again there  came  into his mind unbidden a vision of the  
line 25613=>keen face of Strider bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind. 
line 25614=>But  what  could even a Ranger see except a confused  trail of orc-feet? His 
line 25615=>own  little prints  and Merry's  were overwhelmed by  the  trampling of  the 
line 25616=>iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them. 
line 25617=>     They had  gone  only a mile  or so from the cliff when the  land sloped 
line 25618=>down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. Mist 
line 25619=>lay there, pale-glimmering in the  last rays of  the  sickle moon.  The dark 
line 25620=>shapes of the Orcs in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up. 
line 25621=>     'Ai! Steady now!' shouted Ugl®k from the rear. 
line 25622=>     A sudden thought leaped into Pippin's mind, and he acted on it at once. 
line 25623=>He  swerved aside to the right, and  dived out of the reach of his clutching 
line 25624=>guard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on the grass.  
line 25625=>     'Halt!' yelled Ugl®k. 
line 25626=>     There was for a moment turmoil and confusion. Pippin sprang up and ran. 
line 25627=>But the Orcs were after him. Some suddenly loomed up right in front of him. 
line 25628=>     'No hope  of escape!' thought Pippin. 'But there is a hope  that I have 
line 25629=>left  some of  my own marks unspoilt on the  wet ground.' He groped with his 
line 25630=>two tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the brooch of his cloak. Just as 
line 25631=>long arms and  hard claws seized him. he  let it fall. 'There  I  suppose it 
line 25632=>will lie until the end of time,' he thought. 'I don't  know why I did it. If 
line 25633=>the others have escaped, they've probably all gone with Frodo.' 
line 25634=>     A whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry. 
line 25635=>     'Enough!' shouted Ugl®k running  up. 'He's still got to run a long  way 
line 25636=>yet. Make 'em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.' 
line 25637=>     'But that's not  all,' he snarled, turning to Pippin. 'I shan't forget. 
line 25638=>Payment is only put off. Leg it!' 
line 25639=>     Neither  Pippin nor Merry remembered  much  of the later  part  of  the 
line 25640=>
line 25641=>####-journey. Evil  dreams and evil  waking were blended  into  a  long tunnel of 
line 25642=>misery,  with hope  growing ever fainter behind.  They  ran, and  they  ran, 
line 25643=>striving to keep up the  pace set by  the Orcs, licked  every now  and again 
line 25644=>with a cruel thong cunningly  handled. If they halted or stumbled, they were 
line 25645=>seized and dragged for some distance. 
line 25646=>     The  warmth  of  the orc-draught  had  gone. Pippin felt cold and  sick  
line 25647=>again. Suddenly  he  fell face downward on the turf. Hard hands with rending 
line 25648=>nails  gripped  and lifted him. He was  carried like a  sack  once more, and 
line 25649=>darkness  grew about him:  whether the  darkness  of  another  night,  or  a  
line 25650=>blindness of his eyes, he could not tell. 
line 25651=>     Dimly he became aware of voices clamouring: it seemed that  many of the 
line 25652=>Orcs were demanding a halt. Ugl®k was shouting. He felt himself flung to the 
line 25653=>ground,  and he lay as he fell, till black dreams  took  him. But he did not 
line 25654=>long  escape from  pain; soon  the iron grip of  merciless hands was on  him 
line 25655=>again.  For  a  long  time  he was  tossed and shaken, and then  slowly  the 
line 25656=>darkness  gave way, and he came  back to the waking  world and found that it 
line 25657=>was morning. Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.  
line 25658=>     There  he  lay for a while, fighting  with despair. His head  swam, but 
line 25659=>from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught.  
line 25660=>An Orc stooped over him, and flung him some bread  and a strip of raw  dried 
line 25661=>flesh. He ate  the  stale grey  bread hungrily, but  not the  meat.  He  was 
line 25662=>famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an Orc, the 
line 25663=>flesh of he dared not guess what creature. 
line 25664=>     He sat up and  looked about.  Merry was not  far away. They were by  the 
line 25665=>banks  of a swift narrow  river.  Ahead mountains  loomed: a tall  peak  was 
line 25666=>catching the first rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on the lower  
line 25667=>slopes before them. 
line 25668=>     There was much shou ting and debating among  the Orcs; a  quarrel seemed 
line 25669=>on  the  point  of  breaking  out again  between  the  Northerners  and  the 
line 25670=>Isengarders. Some  were  pointing back  away south, and  some were  pointing 
line 25671=>eastward. 
line 25672=>     'Very  well,' said Ugl®k. 'Leave them  to me then! No killing,  as I've 
line 25673=>told you before; but if you want to  throw away  what we've come all the way 
line 25674=>to get, throw it  away! I'll look after it. Let the fighting Uruk-hai do the 
line 25675=>work, as usual. If you're afraid of the Whiteskins, run!  Run!  There's  the 
line 25676=>forest,' he  shouted, pointing ahead. 'Get to it! It's your  best hope.  Off 
line 25677=>you go!  And quick,  before I knock a few more heads off, to  put some sense 
line 25678=>
line 25679=>####-into the others.' 
line 25680=>     There was some cursing and scuffling, and  then most of the Northe rners 
line 25681=>broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of  them, running wildly along the 
line 25682=>river towards the mountains.  The hobbits were left with the  Isengarders: a  
line 25683=>grim  dark  band, four score at  least of large, swart, slant-eyed Orcs with 
line 25684=>great bows and shor t  broad-bladed swords. A  few  of the larger and  bolder  
line 25685=>Northerners remained with them. 
line 25686=>     'Now we'll deal with  Grishnbkh,'  said Ugl®k; but some even of his own 
line 25687=>followers were looking uneasily southwards.  
line 25688=>     'I  know,' growled Ugl®k.  'The cursed horse-boys have got  wind of us. 
line 25689=>But  that's all your  fault,  Snaga. You and the  other scouts ought to have 
line 25690=>your ears cut  off. But we are the fighters. We'll feast  on horseflesh yet, 
line 25691=>or something better.' 
line 25692=>     At  that moment Pippin  saw why some  of the  troop  had been  pointing  
line 25693=>eastward. From  that  direction there  now came hoarse cries, and  there was 
line 25694=>Grishnbkh again, and  at his  back a  couple  of  score of others like  him: 
line 25695=>long-armed  crook -legged Orcs. They  had a red eye painted on their shields.  
line 25696=>Ugl®k stepped forward to meet them. 'So you've come back?' he said. 'Thought 
line 25697=>better of it, eh?' 
line 25698=>     'I've returned to  see  that  Orders are  carried out and the prisoners 
line 25699=>safe,' answered Grishnbkh. 
line 25700=>     'Indeed!'  said Ugl®k.  'Waste  of  effort.  I'll see that  orders  are 
line 25701=>carried out in my command. And what else did you  come back for? You went 
line 25702=>in 
line 25703=>a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?' 
line 25704=>     'I left a  fool,' snarled Grishnbkh. 'But there were some stout fellows 
line 25705=>with him that are too good to lose. I knew you'd lead them into a mess. I've 
line 25706=>come to help them.' 
line 25707=>     'Splendid!'  laughed  Ugl®k.  'But  unless  you've  got some  guts  for  
line 25708=>fighting, you've taken the wrong way. Lugb®rz was your road.  The 
line 25709=>Whiteskins 
line 25710=>are coming. What's happened to your  precious  Nazgyl?  Has  he had  another  
line 25711=>mount shot under him? Now, if you'd brought him along, that might have  been 
line 25712=>useful-if these Nazgyl are all they make out.' 
line 25713=>     'Nazgyl, Nazgyl,' said Grishnbkh, shivering and licking his lips, as if 
line 25714=>the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. 'You  speak of what is 
line 25715=>deep beyond the  reach of your muddy  dreams,  Ugl®k,' he said. 'Nazgyl! Ah! 
line 25716=>
line 25717=>####-All that  they make  out! One day  you'll  wish that you  had not said that. 
line 25718=>Ape!' he snarled fiercely.  'You ought to know that they're the apple of the 
line 25719=>Great Eye. But the winged  Nazgyl: not  yet, not yet. He won't let them show 
line 25720=>themselves across the Great River yet, not too soon. They're for the War -and 
line 25721=>other purposes.' 
line 25722=>     'You seem  to know a lot,' said  Ugl®k. 'More   than is good for you,  I 
line 25723=>guess.  Perhaps those  in  Lugb®rz  might wonder how, and  why. But  in  the 
line 25724=>meantime the  Uruk -hai of Isengard can do the dirty  work,  as usual.  Don't  
line 25725=>stand slavering there! Get your rabble together! The other swine are legging 
line 25726=>it to the forest. You'd better  follow.  You wouldn't get  back to the Great 
line 25727=>River alive. Right off the mark! Now! I'll be on your heels.' 
line 25728=>     The Isengarders seized Merry and  Pippin again  and slung them on their  
line 25729=>backs. Then the troop started off. Hour after hour they ran, pausing now and 
line 25730=>again only to sling the hobbits to fresh  carriers. Either because they were 
line 25731=>quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of Grishnbkh's, the Isengarders 
line 25732=>gradually passed through the Orcs of Mordor,  and Grishnbkh's folk closed in 
line 25733=>behind. Soon they  were  gaining also on  the Northerners ahead.  The forest  
line 25734=>began to draw nearer. 
line 25735=>     Pippin was bruised and torn,  his aching  head was grated by the filthy 
line 25736=>jowl and hairy ear of the Orc that held him. Immediately in front were bowed 
line 25737=>backs, and tough thick legs going up and down, up and down, unresting, as if 
line 25738=>they were made of wire and horn,  beating out  the nightmare seconds  of  an 
line 25739=>endless time. 
line 25740=>     In  the  afternoon Ugl®k's  troop overtook the  Northerners.  They were 
line 25741=>flagging in the rays  of the  bright sun, winter sun shining in  a pale cool 
line 25742=>sky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out. 
line 25743=>     'Maggots!' jeered the Isengarders. 'You're cooked. The Whiteskins  will 
line 25744=>catch you and eat you. They're coming!' 
line 25745=>     A cry  from Grishnbkh  showed that  this was  not mere jest.  Horsemen, 
line 25746=>riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still  far behind, but gaining 
line 25747=>on the Orcs, gaining on  them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in 
line 25748=>a quicksand. 
line 25749=>     The  Isengarders  began  to run with a redoubled  pace that  astonished 
line 25750=>Pippin, a terrific spurt it seemed  for the end of  a race. Then he saw that 
line 25751=>the  sun was sinking, falling behind the  Misty Mountains;  shadows  reached 
line 25752=>over the land. The soldiers  of Mordor lifted their heads and  also began to 
line 25753=>put on  speed. The forest was dark and close. Already they had passed a  few 
line 25754=>
line 25755=>####-outlying trees.  The land was beginning to slope upwards. ever more steeply; 
line 25756=>but the  Orcs did not halt. Both Ugl®k and Grishnbkh  shouted, spurring them 
line 25757=>on to a last effort. 
line 25758=>     'They will  make it yet. They will escape,' thought Pippin. And then he 
line 25759=>managed  to twist  his neck.  so  as  to  glance back with  one eye over his 
line 25760=>shoulder. He saw that riders away eastward were already level with the Orcs, 
line 25761=>galloping over  the plain.  The sunset gilded their spears  and helmets, and 
line 25762=>glinted  in  their  pale  flowing  hair.  They  were  hemming the  Orcs  in, 
line 25763=>preventing them  from  scattering, and  driving them along the  line of  the 
line 25764=>river. 
line 25765=>     He wondered  very much what kind of folk they were. He wished  now that 
line 25766=>he had learned more in Rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in 
line 25767=>those days the plans for the journey seemed to be  in  more competent hands, 
line 25768=>and he had never reckoned with being cut off from Gandalf, or from  Strider, 
line 25769=>and  even  from Frodo. All  that he  could remember  about  Rohan  was  that 
line 25770=>Gandalf's horse, Shadowfax,  had come from  that land. That sounded hopeful, 
line 25771=>as far as it went. 
line 25772=>     'But how will  they know that  we are not  Orcs?' he thought. 'I  don't  
line 25773=>suppose they've ever  heard  of hobbits down  here. I suppose I  ought to be 
line 25774=>glad that the beastly Orcs  look like being destroyed, but I would rather be 
line 25775=>saved  myself.' The chances were that  he and Merry wou ld be killed together 
line 25776=>with their captors, before ever the Men of Rohan were aware of them. 
line 25777=>     A few of  the riders appeared to be bowmen,  skilled at shooting from a  
line 25778=>running horse. Riding swiftly into  range they shot arrows at  the Orcs that 
line 25779=>straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out 
line 25780=>of the range of the answering  bows  of their  enemies, who shot wildly, not 
line 25781=>daring to halt. This  happened many  times, and on one  occasion arrows fell 
line 25782=>among  the Isengarders. One  of them, just  in front of Pippin, stumbled and  
line 25783=>did not get up again. 
line 25784=>     Night came down without the Riders closing in for battle. Many Orcs had 
line 25785=>fallen,  but fully two hundred remained. In the early darkness the Orcs came 
line 25786=>to a hillock. The eaves of the forest were very near, probably  no more than 
line 25787=>three  furlongs  away,  but  they  could go no  further.  The  horsemen  had 
line 25788=>encircled them. A small band  disobeyed  Ugl®k's command, and ran on 
line 25789=>towards 
line 25790=>the forest: only three returned. 
line 25791=>     'Well,  here  we are,' sneered Grishnbkh. 'Fine  leadership! I hope the 
line 25792=>
line 25793=>####-great Ugl®k will lead us out again.' 
line 25794=>     'Put  those  Halflings  down!'  ordered  Ugl®k,  taking  no  notice  of 
line 25795=>Grishnbkh. 'You, Lugdush, get two others  and stand guard over them! They're 
line 25796=>not to be killed, unless the filthy Whiteskins break through. Understand? As 
line 25797=>long  as I'm alive, I want 'em. But they're not to cry out, and  they're not 
line 25798=>to be rescued. Bind their legs!' 
line 25799=>     The last  part  of  the order was  carried  out mercilessly. But Pippin 
line 25800=>found that for the first time he was close to  Merry. The Orcs were making a  
line 25801=>great deal of noise,  shouting and  clashing  their weapons, and the hobbits 
line 25802=>managed to whisper together for a while. 
line 25803=>     'I don't think much of this,' said Merry. 'I feel nearly done in. Don't 
line 25804=>think I could crawl away far, even if I was free.' 
line 25805=>     'Lembas!' whispered Pippin.  'Lembas: I've got some. Have  you? I  don't  
line 25806=>think they've taken anything but our swords.' 
line 25807=>     'Yes,  I  had a packet in  my pocket,'  answered Merry, 'but it must be 
line 25808=>battered to crumbs. Anyway I can't put my mouth in my pocket!' 
line 25809=>     'You won't have to. I've--'; but just then  a savage kick warned Pippin 
line 25810=>that the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful. 
line 25811=>     The night was  cold  and still. All round the knoll  on which  the  Orcs 
line 25812=>were gathered little watch-fires sprang up,  golden-red  in the  darkness, a  
line 25813=>complete ring  of them. They were within a long bowshot.  but the riders did 
line 25814=>not  show themselves against  the light,  and the  Orcs wasted  many  arrows 
line 25815=>shooting at the  fires, until Ugl®k  stopped them. The riders made no sound.  
line 25816=>Later  in the night when the moon came  out of the  mist,  then occasionally 
line 25817=>they could be seen, shadowy  shapes that glinted now and again in the  white 
line 25818=>light, as they moved in ceaseless patrol. 
line 25819=>     'They'll wait for the Sun, curse them!' growled one of the guards. 'Why 
line 25820=>don't we get together and charge through? What's old Ugl®k think he's doing, 
line 25821=>I should like to know?' 
line 25822=>     'I daresay you would,' snarled Ugl®k stepping up from behind.   'Meaning 
line 25823=>I don't think at all, eh? Curse you! You're as bad as the  other rabble: the 
line 25824=>maggots and the apes of Lugb®rz. No good trying  to charge with them. They'd 
line 25825=>just squeal  and bolt,  and  there  are  more than  enough of  these  filthy 
line 25826=>horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat. 
line 25827=>     'There's only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets 
line 25828=>in the dark. But these Whiteskins have better night-eyes than most Men, from 
line 25829=>all  I've   heard;  and  don't  forget  their  horses!   They  can  see  the 
line 25830=>
line 25831=>####-night-breeze,  or  so it's  said. Still  there's  one thing the fine fellows 
line 25832=>don't know: Mauh®r and his lads are  in the forest, and they  should turn up 
line 25833=>any time now.' 
line 25834=>     Ugl®k's words were enough, apparently, to satisfy  the Isengarders; but 
line 25835=>the  other Orcs  were  both  dispirited  and  rebellious.  They posted a few 
line 25836=>watchers,  but  most of them lay  on  the ground,  resting  in the  pleasant 
line 25837=>darkness. It did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward 
line 25838=>into thick cloud, and  Pippin could not  see anything  a few feet away.  The 
line 25839=>fires brought no light to the hillock. The riders were not, however, content 
line 25840=>merely to wait  for  the dawn and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcry on 
line 25841=>the  east side of the  knoll showed that something was wrong. It seemed that 
line 25842=>some of the Men  had ridden in  close, slipped  off their horses, crawled to 
line 25843=>the edge of the camp and killed several Orcs, and then had faded away again. 
line 25844=>Ugl®k dashed off to stop a stampede. 
line 25845=>     Pippin  and  Merry sat up.  Their guards,  Isengarders,  had  gone with 
line 25846=>Ugl®k. But  if the hobbits  had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. A 
line 25847=>long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew  them close  together. 
line 25848=>Dimly they were  aware of  Grishnbkh's great head and hideous  face  between 
line 25849=>them; his foul breath  was on their cheeks. He began  to paw  them  and feel  
line 25850=>them. Pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back. 
line 25851=>     'Well,  my little  ones!' said Grishnbkh  in a soft whisper.  'Enjoying 
line 25852=>your nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps: swords and whips 
line 25853=>on one side, and nasty spears on  the other! Little people should not meddle 
line 25854=>_in  affairs that  are too big for them.'  His  fingers continued  to grope. 
line 25855=>There was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes. 
line 25856=>     The  thought came suddenly into Pippin's mind, as if caught direct from 
line 25857=>the urgent  thought  of his enemy:  'Grishnbkh  knows about  the  Ring! He's 
line 25858=>looking for it, while Ugl®k is busy: he probably wants it for himself.' Cold 
line 25859=>fear was in Pippin's heart,  yet at the  same time he was wondering what use 
line 25860=>he could make of Grishnbkh's desire. 
line 25861=>     'I don't think you will find it that way,' he whispered. 'It isn't easy 
line 25862=>to find.' 
line 25863=>     'Find  it? ' said Grishnbkh:  his  fingers  stopped crawling and gripped 
line 25864=>Pippin's shoulder. 'Find what? What are you talking about, little one?'. For  
line 25865=>a moment Pippin was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in 
line 25866=>his throat: gollum, gollum. 'Nothing, my precious,' he added. 
line 25867=>     The hobbits felt Grishnbkh's fingers  twitch. 'O ho!' hissed the goblin 
line 25868=>
line 25869=>####-softly. 'That's what he means, is it? O  ho! Very ve-ry dangerous, my little 
line 25870=>ones.' 
line 25871=>     'Perhaps,' said Merry, now alert and aware of Pippin's guess. 'Perhaps;  
line 25872=>and not only  for us. Still you know your own business best. Do you want it,  
line 25873=>or not? And what would you give for it?' 
line 25874=>     'Do I  want it? Do I want it?' said Grishnbkh, as if  puzzled;  but his 
line 25875=>arms were trembling. 'What would I give for it? What do you mean?' 
line 25876=>     'We  mean,'  said Pippin, choosing his  wor ds carefully,  'that it's no 
line 25877=>good groping in  the dark. We could save you  time and trouble. But you must  
line 25878=>untie our legs first, or we'll do nothing, and say nothing.' 
line 25879=>     'My dear tender  little fools,' hissed Grishnbkh, 'everything you have, 
line 25880=>and everything you  know, will be got  out of you  in due  time: everything!  
line 25881=>You'll wish there was more  that  you could tell to  satisfy the Questioner, 
line 25882=>indeed you will:  quite soon. We shan't hurry the enquiry. Oh dear no!  What 
line 25883=>do  you think you've  been kept alive  for? My dear  little  fellows, please 
line 25884=>believe me when I say that it was  not out of kindness: that's not  even one 
line 25885=>of Ugl®k's faults.' 
line 25886=>     'I find it quite  easy to  believe,' said Merry.  'But you haven't  got 
line 25887=>your  prey  home yet. And it doesn't seem  to  be going  your  way,  whatever  
line 25888=>happens. If we come  to  Isengard,  it won't  be the  great  Grishnbkh  that 
line 25889=>benefits: Saruman will take all  that he can find.  If you want anything for  
line 25890=>yourself, now's the time to do a deal.' 
line 25891=>     Grishnbkh  began  to  lose his  temper.  The  name  of  Saruman  seemed  
line 25892=>specially  to enrage him.  Time  was passing  and the disturbance was  dying 
line 25893=>down. Ugl®k or the Isengarders might return at any minute. 
line 25894=>     'Have you got it -- either of you?' he snarled. 
line 25895=>     'Gollum, gollum!' said Pippin. 
line 25896=>     'Untie our legs!' said Merry. 
line 25897=>     They felt the Orc's arms  trembling violently. 'Curse  you, you  filthy 
line 25898=>little vermin!' he hissed. 'Untie your legs? I'll untie every string in your 
line 25899=>bodies. Do you think I can't search you to the  bones? Search  you! I'll cut 
line 25900=>you both to quivering shreds. I don't need the help  of your legs to get you  
line 25901=>away-and have you all to myself!' 
line 25902=>     Suddenly  he seized them. The strength in  his  long arms and shoulders 
line 25903=>was  terrifying. He  tucked  them one under  each  armpit, and crushed  them 
line 25904=>fiercely to his sides; a great stifling hand was clapped  over each of their 
line 25905=>mouths. Then he sprang forward,  stooping low. Quickly and silently he went, 
line 25906=>
line 25907=>####-until he  came to the edge  of the knoll. There, choosing a gap  between the 
line 25908=>watchers, he passed like an evil shadow out into the  night, down  the slope 
line 25909=>and away westward  towards the river that  flowed out of the forest. In that 
line 25910=>direction there was a wide open space with only one fire. 
line 25911=>     After going  a  dozen yards he  halted,  peering and listening. Nothing 
line 25912=>could be  seen or heard. He crept  slowly  on, bent almost  double. Then  he 
line 25913=>squatted and listened  again. Then he stood up, as if to risk a sudden dash. 
line 25914=>At that very moment the  dark form of a  rider loomed up  right  in front of 
line 25915=>him. A horse snorted and reared. A man called out. 
line 25916=>     Grishnbkh flung himself on the ground flat,  dragging the hobbits under  
line 25917=>him; then he drew his sword.  No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather  
line 25918=>than allow them  to escape or to  be rescued;  but  it  was his undoing. The 
line 25919=>sword  rang faintly, and glinted a  little in the light of the fire away  to 
line 25920=>his left. An arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill, 
line 25921=>or guided by fate, and it pierced his right hand. He dr opped the  sword  and 
line 25922=>shrieked. There was a quick beat of hoofs, and  even as  Grishnbkh leaped up 
line 25923=>and  ran,  he  was ridden down and  a spear  passed through  him.  He gave a  
line 25924=>hideous shivering cry and lay still. 
line 25925=>     The hobbits remained flat on  the  ground, as  Grishnbkh had left them. 
line 25926=>Another  horseman came riding swiftly  to his comrade's aid. Whether because 
line 25927=>of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse 
line 25928=>lifted  and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did  not see them, lying 
line 25929=>covered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to 
line 25930=>move. 
line 25931=>     At  last  Merry stirred and whispered softly: 'So  far so good: but how 
line 25932=>are we to avoid being spitted?' 
line 25933=>     The answer came almost immediately. The cries of Grishnbkh  had  roused 
line 25934=>the Orcs. From the yells  and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits 
line 25935=>guessed  that their  disappearance had been discovered:  Ugl®k  was probably 
line 25936=>knocking  off  a  few  more  heads.  Then suddenly  the answering  cries  of 
line 25937=>orc-voices came from the  right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the 
line 25938=>direction of the forest and the mountains. Mauh®r had apparently arrived and 
line 25939=>was attacking the besiegers. There was  the sound  of galloping  horses. The 
line 25940=>Riders  were  drawing  in  their  ring  close  round the  knoll, risking the 
line 25941=>orc-arrows, so as  to prevent any sortie, while a company  rode off to  deal 
line 25942=>with the newcomers.  Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized  that without moving 
line 25943=>they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape. 
line 25944=>
line 25945=>####-     'Now,' said Merry,  'if only we had our legs  and hands free,  we might 
line 25946=>get away. But I can't touch the knots, and I can't bite them.' 
line 25947=>     'No need to  try,'  said Pippin. 'I was going to tell you: I've managed 
line 25948=>to free  my  hands. These loops are only  left for show. You'd better have a  
line 25949=>bit of lembas first.' 
line 25950=>     He slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. The cakes 
line 25951=>were broken, but good,  still in their leaf-wrappings. The  hobbits each ate 
line 25952=>two  or three  pieces.  The  taste brought  back  to them the memory of fair 
line 25953=>faces,  and laughter, and wholesome food in  quiet  days now far away. For a 
line 25954=>while they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the dark, heedless  of the cries and 
line 25955=>sounds of battle nearby. Pippin was the first to come back to the present. 
line 25956=>     'We must be off,' he said. 'Half a moment!' Grishnbkh's sword was lying 
line 25957=>close at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled 
line 25958=>forward, and finding the body of the goblin  he  drew from its sheath a long 
line 25959=>sharp knife. With this he quickly cut their bonds.  
line 25960=>     'Now for it!' he said. 'When we've warmed up a bit, perhaps we shall be 
line 25961=>able  to stand again, and  walk.  But  in any case  we  had better start  by 
line 25962=>crawling.' 
line 25963=>     They crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped them: but 
line 25964=>it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide  berth,  and 
line 25965=>wormed their way  forward bit  by  bit, until  they came to the edge  of the 
line 25966=>river, gurgling away in  the black shadows under its deep   banks. Then  they 
line 25967=>looked back. 
line 25968=>     The sounds  had  died away.  Evidently  Mauh®r  and his 'lads' had been 
line 25969=>killed or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. 
line 25970=>It would not last very much longer. Already  the night was old. In the East, 
line 25971=>which had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale. 
line 25972=>     'We must get under cover,' said  Pippin, 'or we  shall be seen. It will 
line 25973=>not  be any  comfort  to us, if  these riders discover that we are  not Orcs 
line 25974=>after we are dead.' He got up and stamped his feet. 'Those cords have cut me 
line 25975=>like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. I could stagger on now. What 
line 25976=>about you, Merry?' 
line 25977=>     Merry got up. 'Yes,' he said, 'I can  manage it. Lembas does put  heart 
line 25978=>into  you! A more  wholesome sort  of  feeling, too, than  the heat  of that 
line 25979=>orc-draught.  I  wonder  what it was made of. Better not to  know, I expect. 
line 25980=>Let's get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it!' 
line 25981=>     'Not here, the banks are too steep,' said Pippin. 'Forward now!' 
line 25982=>
line 25983=>####-     They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river. 
line 25984=>Behind them the light grew in the East. As they  walked they compared notes,  
line 25985=>talking  lightly in  hobbit-fashion of the things  that  had happened  since 
line 25986=>their capture. No listener would  have guessed from their words that they had 
line 25987=>suffered cruelly, and been in dire peril, going without hope towards torment  
line 25988=>and death; or that even now, as they knew  well,  they had  little chance of 
line 25989=>ever finding friend or safety again. 
line 25990=>     'You seem to  have been doing well, Master Took,' said Merry.  'You will 
line 25991=>get  almost  a chapter in old Bilbo's book, if ever I get a chance to report 
line 25992=>to him. Good work: especially guessing that hairy villain's little game, and 
line 25993=>playing up to him. But I wonder if anyone will  ever pick up your trail  and 
line 25994=>find that brooch. I should hate to lose mine, but I am afraid  yours is gone 
line 25995=>for good. 
line 25996=>     'I  shall have  to brush up my  toes,  if I am to  get level  with you. 
line 25997=>Indeed Cousin Brandybuck is going in front now. This is wher e he comes in. I 
line 25998=>don't  suppose  you have much notion  where we are;  but I spent  my time at 
line 25999=>Rivendell rather better. We are walking west along the Entwash. The butt-end 
line 26000=>of the Misty Mountains is in front, and Fangorn Forest.' 
line 26001=>     Even as he spoke the da rk edge of the  forest loomed up straight before 
line 26002=>them. Night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away 
line 26003=>from the coming Dawn. 
line 26004=>     'Lead on, Master  Brandybuck!' said Pippin. 'Or lead back! We have been 
line 26005=>warned against Fangorn. But one so knowing will not have forgotten that.' 
line 26006=>     'I have  not,' answered Merry; 'but the forest seems better to  me, all 
line 26007=>the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.' 
line 26008=>     He  led the way  in under the  huge branches  of  the trees. Old beyond 
line 26009=>guessing, they  seemed. Great  trailing  beards of lichen  hung  from  them, 
line 26010=>blowing and swaying in  the breeze. Out of the  shadows the  hobbits peeped, 
line 26011=>gazing back down the slope: little  furtive  figures  that in the  dim light 
line 26012=>looked like elf-children  in the deeps  of time peering out of the Wild Wood  
line 26013=>in wonder at their first Dawn. 
line 26014=>     Far  over the  Great  River,  and the  Brown  Lands,  leagues upon grey 
line 26015=>leagues away, the Dawn came,  red as flame.  Loud rang the hunting-horns  to 
line 26016=>greet it.  The Rider s of Rohan sprang suddenly  to life. Horn  answered horn 
line 26017=>again. 
line 26018=>     Merry and  Pippin heard,  clear  in  the  cold  air,  the  neighing  of 
line 26019=>war-horses, and  the  sudden singing of many men. The Sun's limb was lifted, 
line 26020=>
line 26021=>####-an  arc of  fire,  above the margin of the world. Then with a great  cry the 
line 26022=>Riders charged from  the East; the red  light gleamed on mail and spear. The 
line 26023=>Orcs yelled  and shot all the arrows that remained to  them. The hobbits saw 
line 26024=>several horsemen fall; but their line held on up  the hill  and  over it, and 
line 26025=>wheeled round and charged  again. Most  of the raiders that were  left alive 
line 26026=>then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. But 
line 26027=>one band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the  
line 26028=>direction  of  the  forest.  Straight up the slope they charged  towards the 
line 26029=>watchers. Now they were drawing near,  and it seemed certain that they would 
line 26030=>escape: they had already hewn down three Riders that barred their way. 
line 26031=>     'We have watched too long,' said Merry. 'There's Ugl®k! I don't want to 
line 26032=>meet him again.' The hobbits turned and  fled deep into the  shadows of  the 
line 26033=>wood. 
line 26034=>     So it  was  that  they did not sec  the  last  stand,  when  Ugl®k  was 
line 26035=>overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of Fangorn. There he was slain 
line 26036=>at last by Jomer,  the Third Marshal  of the Mark, who dismounted and fought 
line 26037=>him  sword to sword.  And over  the  wide fields the keen-eyed Riders hunted 
line 26038=>down the few Orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly. 
line 26039=>     Then when they had  laid their fallen comrades in a  mound and had sung 
line 26040=>their praises, the Riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their 
line 26041=>enemies.  So ended  the raid, and no  news  of  it came ever back either  to 
line 26042=>Mordor or to Isengard; but the smoke of  the burning rose high to heaven and 
line 26043=>was seen by many watchful eyes.  
line 26044=> 
line 26045=>
line 26046=>####-<h4>Chapter 4.</h4> <br> Treebeard 
line 26047=>
line 26048=> 
line 26049=> 
line 26050=>     Meanwhile the hobbits went with  as much speed as  the dark and tangled  
line 26051=>forest allowed, following  the line of the  running  stream, westward and up 
line 26052=>towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into  Fangorn. Slowly 
line 26053=>their fear of the Orcs died away, and their pace slackened. A queer stifling 
line 26054=>feeling came  over  them,  as  if the air were  too thin or too  scanty  for  
line 26055=>breathing. 
line 26056=>     At last Merry halted.  'We can't go on like this,' he  panted.  'I want 
line 26057=>some air.' 
line 26058=>     'Let's have  a  drink  at any rate,'  said  Pippin. 'I'm  parched.'  He 
line 26059=>clambered on to a  great tree-root that  wound  down  into the  stream,  and 
line 26060=>stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. It was clear and  cold, and 
line 26061=>he  took many draughts.  Merry followed  him.  The water refreshed them  and 
line 26062=>seemed  to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the brink of 
line 26063=>the  stream,  dabbling  their  sore feet and legs, and peering round at  the 
line 26064=>trees that  stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away 
line 26065=>into grey twilight in every direction. 
line 26066=>     'I suppose you  haven't  lost us already?'  said  Pippin,  leaning back  
line 26067=>against  a great tree-trunk.  'We  can  at  least follow the  course of this 
line 26068=>stream, the Entwash or whatever you call  it, and get  out again  the way we 
line 26069=>came.' 
line 26070=>     'We could, if  our legs  would  do it,' said  Merry;  'and if  we could 
line 26071=>breathe properly.' 
line 26072=>     'Yes, it is  all  very  dim,  and stuffy,  in   here,' said Pippin.  'It 
line 26073=>reminds me, somehow, of the  old room in the  Great Place of  the Tooks away 
line 26074=>back in the  Smials at Tuckborough:  a huge place,  where  the furniture has 
line 26075=>never been moved or changed for generations. They say  the Old Took lived in 
line 26076=>it  year  after  year,  while  he  and  the  room  got  older  and  shabbier  
line 26077=>together -and  it has  never changed since  he  died, a century ago.  And Old 
line 26078=>Gerontius was my great-great-grandfather: that  puts it back a bit. But that 
line 26079=>is  nothing  to the old feeling of  this  wood.  Look at  all those weeping, 
line 26080=>trailing,  beards and whiskers of lichen! And  most of the trees seem  to be 
line 26081=>half covered with ragged dry  leaves that have never fallen. Untidy. I can't  
line 26082=>imagine what spring  would look  like here, if  i t ever comes; still  less a  
line 26083=>spring-cleaning.' 
line 26084=>
line 26085=>####-     'But the Sun at any  rate must peep in sometimes.' said Merry. 'It does 
line 26086=>not look or feel at all like Bilbo's  description of Mirkwood.  That was all 
line 26087=>dark and black,  and the home  of dark black  things. This is just dim,  and 
line 26088=>frightfully  tree-ish.  You  can't imagine animals  living here  at all,  or 
line 26089=>staying for long.' 
line 26090=>     'No, nor hobbits,' said Pippin. 'And I don't like the thought of trying 
line 26091=>to get through  it  either.  Nothing to cat  for a  hundred  miles, I should 
line 26092=>guess. How are our supplies?' 
line 26093=>     'Low,'  said Merry.  'We ran  off  with nothing but a  couple of  spare 
line 26094=>packets  of  lembas, and  left everything else behind.' They  looked at what 
line 26095=>remained of the  elven-cakes:  broken  fragments for abou t five meagre days, 
line 26096=>that  was all. 'And not a wrap or a blanket,' said Merry.  'We shall be cold 
line 26097=>tonight, whichever way we go.' 
line 26098=>     'Well, we'd  better decide on  the way now,' said  Pippin. 'The morning 
line 26099=>must be getting on.' 
line 26100=>     Just then they became  aware of a yellow light that  had appeared, some 
line 26101=>way further  on into the  wood: shafts  of sunlight seemed  suddenly to have  
line 26102=>pierced the forest -roof. 
line 26103=>     'Hullo!' said Merry.  'The Sun must have run into a cloud  while  we've 
line 26104=>been under these  trees, and now she  has  run  out  again; or  else she has 
line 26105=>climbed high enough to look down through some opening. It isn't far let's go 
line 26106=>and investigate!' 
line 26107=>     They  found  it was  further than  they thought. The  ground was rising 
line 26108=>steeply  still,  and  it was becoming  increasingly stony.  The  light  grew 
line 26109=>broader as they went on, and soon they saw that there was a rock -wall before 
line 26110=>them: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of  some long root thrust out by 
line 26111=>the distant mountains.  No trees grew on it, and the sun was falling full on 
line 26112=>its stony face. The twigs of the trees at  its foot were stretched out stiff 
line 26113=>and still, as if reaching out to the warmth. Where  all had looked so shabby 
line 26114=>and grey before, the wood now gleamed with rich browns, and with the  
line 26115=>smooth 
line 26116=>black-greys  of bark  like polished leather.  The boles of the trees  glowed 
line 26117=>with a soft green like young grass: early spring or  a fleeting vision of it 
line 26118=>was about them. 
line 26119=>     In the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural 
line 26120=>perhaps, and  made by the weathering  and splitting  of the rock, for it was 
line 26121=>rough and uneven. High up, almost level with the tops of forest -trees, there 
line 26122=>
line 26123=>####-was a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at 
line 26124=>its edge, and  one old stump of a tree  with only two bent branches left: it 
line 26125=>looked almost  like the figure  of some gnarled  old  man,  standing  there, 
line 26126=>blinking in the morning-light. 
line 26127=>     'Up  we go!' said Merry joyfully. 'Now for a breath of air, and a sight 
line 26128=>of the land!' 
line 26129=>     They climbed  and scrambled up the rock. If the  stair had been made it 
line 26130=>was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs. They were  too eager to  be 
line 26131=>surprised at the  remarkable  way  in  which the  cuts  and  sores of  their 
line 26132=>captivity  had healed and their  vigour had returned. They came at length to 
line 26133=>the edge  of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang 
line 26134=>up  and  turned  round  with their backs  to the  hill, breathing  deep, and 
line 26135=>looking  out eastward. They saw  that they had  only come some three or four 
line 26136=>miles  into the  forest:  the heads  of the  trees marched  down  the slopes 
line 26137=>towards the  plain. There, near the fringe  of  the forest,  tall spires  of 
line 26138=>curling black smoke went up, wavering and floating towards them. 
line 26139=>     'The wind's changing,'  said Merry.  'It's  turned east again. It feels 
line 26140=>cool up here.' 
line 26141=>     'Yes,'  said Pippin; 'I'm  afraid this is only a passing  gleam, and it 
line 26142=>will  all go grey  again. What a  pity! This  shaggy  old  forest  looked so 
line 26143=>different in the sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place.' 
line 26144=>     'Almost felt you liked the  Forest! That's good! That's uncommonly kind 
line 26145=>of you,' said  a strange voice.  'Turn round and let  me have a look at your 
line 26146=>faces. I almost feel that  I dislike you  both, but do  not let us be hasty. 
line 26147=>Turn round!' A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders,  
line 26148=>and they  were twisted round,  gently but irresistibly; then  two great arms 
line 26149=>lifted them up. 
line 26150=>     They  found that they  were looking  at a  most extraordinary face.  It 
line 26151=>belonged to a  large  Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen 
line 26152=>foot high,  very sturdy, with a tall  head,  and hardly any neck. Whether it 
line 26153=>was clad in stuff like green  and grey  bark, or  whether that was its hide, 
line 26154=>was  difficult to say. At any  rate the  arms, at a short distance from  the 
line 26155=>trunk, were not wrinkled,  but covered  with a brown smooth skin.  The large 
line 26156=>feet had seven toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a  
line 26157=>sweeping grey beard, bushy, almost twiggy  at the roots,  thin and mossy  at 
line 26158=>the  ends. But  at  the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes.  These 
line 26159=>deep  eyes  were now  surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. 
line 26160=>
line 26161=>####-They were brown, shot  with a green light. Often  afterwards Pippin tried to 
line 26162=>describe his first impression of them. 
line 26163=>     'One felt  as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with 
line 26164=>ages of  memory  and long, slow,  steady  thinking;  but  their surface  was 
line 26165=>sparkling with  the present: like sun shimmering on the  outer  leaves of  a  
line 26166=>vast tree, or on the ripples of a very deep lake.  I don't know but it  felt 
line 26167=>as  if  something  that grew  in the  ground-asleep, you might say, or  just  
line 26168=>feeling itself  as  something between  roof-tip  and leaf-tip, between  deep 
line 26169=>earth  and sky had suddenly waked up, and was  considering you with the same 
line 26170=>slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless years.' 
line 26171=>     'Hrum, Hoom,'  murmured  the  voice,  a deep  voice  like a  very  deep 
line 26172=>woodwind  instrument. 'Very odd indeed! Do  not  be hasty, that is my motto. 
line 26173=>But if I had seen you,  before I heard your voices-I liked them: nice little 
line 26174=>voices: they reminded me of something I cannot  remember ---if I had seen you  
line 26175=>before I heard you, I should have just trodden on you, taking you for little 
line 26176=>Orcs, and found out my mistake  afterwards. Very odd  you  are, indeed. Root 
line 26177=>and twig, very odd!' 
line 26178=>     Pippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. Under those eyes he 
line 26179=>felt a curious suspense, but  not fear. 'Please.' he said, 'who are you? And 
line 26180=>what are you?' 
line 26181=>     A queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells 
line 26182=>were covered over.  'Hrum, now,' answered the voice;  'well,  I am an Ent, or  
line 26183=>that's  what  they call me.  Yes, Ent is the word. The Ent, I am,  you might 
line 26184=>say,  in your  manner  of  speaking. Fangorn is  my name according to  some, 
line 26185=>Treebeard others make it. Treebeard will do.' 
line 26186=>     'An Ent?' said  Merry.  'What's  that? But  what do you  call yourself?  
line 26187=>What's your real name?' 
line 26188=>     'Hoo now!' replied  Treebeard. 'Hoo! Now that would be  telling! Not so 
line 26189=>hasty.  And I  am doing the  asking. You are  in my country. What are you,  I  
line 26190=>wonder? I cannot place you. You do not  seem to come in the old lists that I  
line 26191=>learned when I was young. But  that was a long, long time ago, and  they may 
line 26192=>have made new lists. Let me see! Let me see! How did it go?

line 26207=>     Swan the whitest, serpent coldest... 
line 26208=>     Hoom, hm; hoom. hm. how did it go? Room tum, room tum, roomty toom 
line 26209=>tum. 
line 26210=>It was a long list. But anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere!' 
line 26211=>     'We  always seem  to have got   left out of the  old lists, and the  old 
line 26212=>stories,' said  Merry.  'Yet we've been about for quite a long  time.  We're 
line 26213=>hobbits.' 
line 26214=>     'Why not make a new line?' said Pippin. 
line 26215=>     'Half-grown hobbits, the hole -dwellers. 
line 26216=>     Put us in amongst the four, next to Man (the Big People) and you've got 
line 26217=>it.' 
line 26218=>     'Hm! Not bad, not bad,' said Treebeard.  'That would do. So you live in 
line 26219=>holes, eh? It  sounds very right and proper. Who calls  you hobbits, though?  
line 26220=>That does not sound elvish to me. Elves made all  the old   words: they began 
line 26221=>it.' 
line 26222=>     'Nobody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,' said Pippin. 
line 26223=>     'Hoom, hmm! Come  now!  Not so hasty!  You call yourselves hobbits? But 
line 26224=>you should not go telling just anybody. You'll be letting out your own right 
line 26225=>names if you're not careful.' 
line 26226=>     'We aren't careful about  that,' said Merry. 'As a matter of fact I'm a  
line 26227=>Brandybuck, Meriadoc Brandybuck, though most people call me just Merry.' 
line 26228=>     'And I'm a Took, Peregrin Took,  but  I'm generally called  Pippin,  or  
line 26229=>even Pip.' 
line 26230=>     'Hm, but you are hasty folk, I see,' said Treebeard. 'I  am honoured by 
line 26231=>your confidence; but you should not be too free all at once.  There are Ents 
line 26232=>and  Ents, you know; or there  are Ents and things that look like  Ents  but 
line 26233=>ain't, as you  might say. I'll call you  Merry and Pippin if you please-nice 
line 26234=>names. For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.' A queer  
line 26235=>half-knowing,  half-humorous look came with  a green flicker into his  eyes.  
line 26236=>
line 26237=>####-'For one thing it would  take a long while: my name is growing all the time, 
line 26238=>and I've lived a  very  long, long time; so my  name is like  a story.  Real 
line 26239=>names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the 
line 26240=>Old  Entish  as you might say. It is a lovely  language, but it takes a very 
line 26241=>long  time to say  anything in it, because  we do  not  say anything  in it. 
line 26242=>unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to listen to. 
line 26243=>     'But  now,' and  the  eyes became very bright and 'present', seeming to 
line 26244=>grow smaller and almost sharp, 'what is  going  on? What are you doing in it  
line 26245=>all? I can see and hear  (and smell and feel) a great deal from  this,  from 
line 26246=>this, from this  a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-bur®ml. Excuse me: that 
line 26247=>is a part of my name for it; I do not know what  the word is  in the outside 
line 26248=>languages: you know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine 
line 26249=>mornings, and  think about  the Sun, and the grass beyond the wood,  and the 
line 26250=>horses, and the clouds, and the  unfolding of the world. What  is going  on?  
line 26251=>What is Gandalf up  to? And these -- burbrum,' he made a deep rumbling noise 
line 26252=>like a discord on a great organ --  'these Orcs, and young Saruman  down  at 
line 26253=>Isengard? I like news. But not too quick now.' 
line 26254=>     'There is quite a lot going on,' said Merry:  'and even if we tried  to 
line 26255=>be quick, it  would  take a  long time to tell.  But you  told  us not to be 
line 26256=>hasty. Ought we to tell you anything so soon? Would you think it rude, if we  
line 26257=>asked what you are  going to do with us, and  which side you are on? And did 
line 26258=>you know Gandalf?' 
line 26259=>     'Yes, I do know  him: the only wizard that really cares  about  trees ' 
line 26260=>said Treebeard. 'Do you know him?' 
line 26261=>     'Yes,'  said Pippin  sadly, 'we did. He  was a great friend, and he was 
line 26262=>our guide.' 
line 26263=>     'Then I  can answer your other  questions,' said  Treebeard. 'I  am not 
line 26264=>going to do anything with you: not if you mean by that 'do something  to you ' 
line 26265=>without your  leave. We might  do  some things together. I don't  know about 
line 26266=>sides. I go my own way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. But 
line 26267=>you speak of Master  Gandalf,  as if he was  in a story that had come  to an 
line 26268=>end.' 
line 26269=>     'Yes, we do,' said Pippin sadly. 'The story seems to be going on, but I 
line 26270=>am afraid Gandalf has fallen out of it.' 
line 26271=>     'Hoo,  come  now!'  said  Treebeard.   'Hoom, hm, ah  well.'  He paused, 
line 26272=>looking long at the hobbits: 'Hoom, ah, well I do not know what to say. Come 
line 26273=>now!' 
line 26274=>
line 26275=>####-     'If you  would like to hear more. said Merry, 'we will tell you. But it 
line 26276=>will take some time. Wouldn't you like to put us  down? Couldn't we sit here 
line 26277=>together in the sun, while it lasts? You must be getting tired of holding us 
line 26278=>up.' 
line 26279=>     'Hm,  tired? No. I am not tired. I do not easily get tired. And I do not 
line 26280=>sit down. I am not very. hm, bendable. But there.  the  Sun is  going in. Let 
line 26281=>us leave this  -- did you say what you call it?' 
line 26282=>     'Hill?' suggested Pippin. 'Shelf? Step?' suggested Merry. 
line 26283=>     Treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully. 'Hill. Yes, that was it. But 
line 26284=>it is a hasty word  for  a thing that has stood here ever since this part of 
line 26285=>the world was shaped. Never mind. Let us leave it, and go.' 
line 26286=>     'Where shall we go?' asked Merry. 
line 26287=>     'To my home, or one of my homes,' answered Treebeard. 
line 26288=>     'Is it far?' 
line 26289=>     'I do not  know.  You might  call it far, perhaps.  But what does  tha t 
line 26290=>matter?' 
line 26291=>     'Well,  you see, we have lost all our belongings,' said Merry. 'We have 
line 26292=>only a little food.' 
line 26293=>     'O!  Hm! You need not  trouble about that,' said Treebeard. 'I can give 
line 26294=>you a drink that will keep you green and growing for a long, long while. And 
line 26295=>if we decide to part company, I can  set you down outside my  country at any 
line 26296=>point you choose. Let us go!' 
line 26297=>     Holding the hobbits gently but firmly, one  in  the crook of each  arm, 
line 26298=>Treebeard lifted up first one large foot and then the  other, and  moved them 
line 26299=>to the  edge  of  the  shelf. The  rootlike  toes grasped  the  rocks.  Then 
line 26300=>carefully  and solemnly, he  stalked down from step to step, and reached the 
line 26301=>floor of the Forest. 
line 26302=>     At once he set off with  long  deliberate strides  through  the  trees, 
line 26303=>deeper  and  deeper into  the  wood, never  far  from  the  stream, climbing 
line 26304=>steadily up  towards  the slopes of the mountains. Many of the  trees seemed 
line 26305=>asleep, or as unaware of him as of any other creature that merely passed by;  
line 26306=>but  some quivered, and some  raised up  their branches above his head as he 
line 26307=>approached.  All  the  while, as he walked, he  talked to  himself in a long 
line 26308=>running stream of musical sounds.  
line 26309=>     The hobbits  were silent for some time. They  felt, oddly  enough, safe 
line 26310=>and  comfortable, and they had a great deal  to think and wonder  about.  At  
line 26311=>last Pippin ventured to speak again. 
line 26312=>
line 26313=>####-     'Please, Treebeard,' he said,  'could I  ask  you  something?  Why  did 
line 26314=>Celeborn  warn  us  against  your forest?  He  told us  not to  risk getting 
line 26315=>entangled in it.' 
line 26316=>     'Hmm,  did he now?' rumbled  Treebeard. 'And I might have said much the 
line 26317=>same, if you had been going the other way. Do  not risk getting entangled in 
line 26318=>the  woods of  Laurelindurenan ! That  is what the Elves used to call it, but 
line 26319=>now they  make the  name  shorter: Lothlurien they call it. Perhaps they are 
line 26320=>right: maybe it is fading;  not growing. Land of the Valley of Singing Gold, 
line 26321=>that was it, once upon a time. Now it is the Dreamflower. Ah well! But it is 
line 26322=>a queer  place, and  not for just any one to venture in. I am surprised that 
line 26323=>you ever got out, but much more surprised that you ever got in: that has not 
line 26324=>happened to strangers for many a year. It is a queer land. 
line 26325=>     'And  so is  this. Folk have  come  to grief here. Aye, they  have ,  to 
line 26326=>grief.  Laurelindurenan lindelorendor malinornjlion ornemalin ,' he hummed to 
line 26327=>himself. 'They are falling rather  behind  the world in  there, I guess,' he 
line 26328=>said 'Neither  this country, nor anything else  outside the Golden  Wood, is 
line 26329=>what it was when Celeborn was young. Still: 
line 26330=>     Taurelilumla-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurla Lumlanor,1 
line 26331=>     that is what  they used to say.  Things have  changed, but it is  still 
line 26332=>true in places.' 
line 26333=>     'What do you mean?' said Pippin. 'What is true?' 
line 26334=>     'The trees and the Ents,' said Treebeard. 'I do not understand all that 
line 26335=>goes  on myself, so I cannot explain it  to  you. Some of us are  still true 
line 26336=>Ents, and  lively enough  in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going 
line 26337=>tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are ju st trees, of course; but 
line 26338=>many are half  awake. Some  are quite wide awake, and a  few are,  well, ah,  
line 26339=>well getting Entish. That is going on all the time. 
line 26340=>     'When that happens to  a  tree,  you find that  some have  bad  hearts.  
line 26341=>Nothing to do with their wood: I do not mean that. Why, I knew some good old 
line 26342=>willows  down  the Entwash, gone  long ago,  alas!  They were  quite hollow, 
line 26343=>indeed  they were falling all to pieces, but as quiet and  sweet-spoken as a  
line 26344=>young  leaf.  And  then  there are  some  trees  in  the  valleys  under the 
line 26345=>mountains, sound as a bell, and bad right through.  That sort of thing seems 
line 26346=>to spread. There used to be some very dangerous parts in this country. There 
line 26347=>are still some very black patches.' 
line 26348=>     'Like the Old Forest away to the north, do you mean?' asked Merry. 
line 26349=>     'Aye, aye. something like, but much worse. I do not doubt there is some 
line 26350=>
line 26351=>####-shadow of the Great Darkness  lying there still away north; and bad memories 
line 26352=>are handed down. But there are hollow dales in this land where the  Darkness 
line 26353=>has never been lifted, and the trees are older  than I am. Still, we do what 
line 26354=>we can. We keep off strangers and the  foolhardy; and we train and we teach, 
line 26355=>we walk and we weed. 
line 26356=>     'We are tree-herds, we old  Ents. Few  enough of us are left now. Sheep 
line 26357=>get  like shepherd, and shepherds like  sheep, it is said;  but  slowly, and 
line 26358=>neither have  long in the world. It  is quicker and  closer with  trees  and 
line 26359=>Ents, and they walk down the  ages  together. For Ents are more like  Elves:  
line 26360=>less interested  in   themselves than Men are,  and  better at getting inside 
line 26361=>other things.  And yet again  Ents are more like Men,  more  changeable than 
line 26362=>Elves are, and  quicker at taking the colour of the outside,  you might say.  
line 26363=>Or  better than both:  for they are steadier a nd keep their  minds on things 
line 26364=>longer. 'Some of my kin look just  like trees now, and need something  great 
line 26365=>to  rouse them; and they speak  only in whispers. But  some  of my trees are 
line 26366=>limb-lithe, and many can talk to me. Elves began it, of course, waking trees 
line 26367=>up  and  teaching  them to speak and  learning their  tree-talk. They always 
line 26368=>wished to talk to everything, the old Elves did. But then the Great Darkness 
line 26369=>came, and they passed away  over the Sea, or fled into far  valleys, and hid 
line 26370=>themselves,  and made  songs  about days that would never come again.  Never 
line 26371=>again. Aye,  aye, there was all  one wood once upon a time: from here to the 
line 26372=>Mountains of Lune, and this was just the East End. 
line 26373=>     'Those were the broad days! Time was when I could walk and sing a ll day 
line 26374=>and  hear no more  than  the echo of my own  voice in the hollow hills.  The 
line 26375=>woods were like the woods of Lothlurien. only thicker stronger, younger. And 
line 26376=>the smell of the air! I used to spend a week just breathing.' 
line 26377=>     Treebeard  fell silent, striding along, and yet  making  hardly a sound 
line 26378=>with his great feet. Then he began to hum again, and passed into a murmuring 
line 26379=>chant. Gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them: 
line 26380=>     In the willow-meads of Tasarinan I walked in the Spring. 
line 26381=>     Ah! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion! 
line 26382=>     And I said that was good. 
line 26383=>     I wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of Ossiriand. 
line 26384=>     Ah! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of Ossir! 
line 26385=>     And I thought that was best. 
line 26386=>     To the beeches of Neldoreth I came in the Autumn. 
line 26387=>     Ah!  the  gold and the red  and the sighing of leaves  in the Autumn in  
line 26388=>
line 26389=>####-Taur-na-neldor! 
line 26390=>     It was more than my desire. 
line 26391=>     To the pine-trees upon the  highland of  Dorthonion  I climbed  in  the 
line 26392=>Winter. 
line 26393=>     Ah! the wind and the whiteness and the black  branches  of  Winter upon 
line 26394=>Orod-na-Thfn! 
line 26395=>     My voice went up and sang in the sky. 
line 26396=>     And now all those lands lie under the wave. 
line 26397=>     And I walk in Ambaruna, in Tauremorna, in Aldaluml. 
line 26398=>     In my own land, in the country of Fangorn, 
line 26399=>     Where the roots are long, 
line 26400=>     And the years lie thicker than the leaves 
line 26401=>     In Tauremornaluml. 
line 26402=>     He  ended, and strode on silently, and in all  the wood, as far  as ear 
line 26403=>could reach, there was not a sound. 
line 26404=>     The day  waned,  and dusk was twined about  the boles of  the trees. At  
line 26405=>last  the hobbits saw, rising dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had 
line 26406=>come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall Methedras.  
line 26407=>Down the hillside  the young Entwash,  leaping  from its springs  high above,  
line 26408=>ran noisily from step to step to meet them. On the right of the stream there 
line 26409=>was  a long slope, clad with grass, now  grey in the twilight. No trees grew 
line 26410=>there  and  it  was  open  to  the sky;  stars were shining already in lakes 
line 26411=>between shores of cloud.  
line 26412=>     Treebeard  strode  up the slope,  hardly  slackening his pace. Suddenly 
line 26413=>before them the hobbits saw a wide opening. Two great trees stood there, one 
line 26414=>on  either side, like living gate-posts; bu t  there was  no gate  save their 
line 26415=>crossing and interwoven boughs. As  the old Ent approached, the trees lifted 
line 26416=>up their branches, and all  their leaves quivered and rustled. For they were 
line 26417=>evergreen trees, and their leaves were dark and polished, and gleamed in the 
line 26418=>twilight. Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great 
line 26419=>hall had been cut  in the side of the hill. On either hand the  walls sloped 
line 26420=>upwards, until they were fifty feet high  or more, and along each wall stood 
line 26421=>an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards.  
line 26422=>     At the far end the rock -wall was sheer,  but at  the bottom it had been 
line 26423=>hollowed back into a  shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of  the 
line 26424=>hall, save the branches  of  the trees, which  at the inner end overshadowed 
line 26425=>all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle. A little stream 
line 26426=>
line 26427=>####-escaped from  the springs above,  and leaving the main  water, fell tinkling 
line 26428=>down  the  sheer face  of the wall, pouring in silver  drops,  like  a   fine 
line 26429=>curtain  in front  of the arched bay. The water was  gathered  again into  a  
line 26430=>stone basin in the floor between the trees, and thence it spilled and flowed 
line 26431=>away beside the open path, out  to rejoin the Entwash in its journey through 
line 26432=>the forest. 
line 26433=>     'Hm! Here we are!' said Treebeard, breaking his  long silence.  'I have 
line 26434=>brought you about  seventy  thousand  ent-strides, but what that comes to in 
line 26435=>the measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow we are near the roots  of 
line 26436=>the  Last Mountain.  Part of the name of this place might be Wellinghall, if 
line 26437=>it were turned into your language. I like it. We will stay here tonight.' He 
line 26438=>set them  down  on  the  grass  between  the aisles  of the  trees, and they 
line 26439=>followed  him  towards the great arch. The  hobbits  now  noticed that as he 
line 26440=>walked his  knees  hardly bent, but  his  legs opened in  a great stride. He 
line 26441=>planted  his big toes (and they  were indeed  big, and very  broad)  on  the 
line 26442=>ground first, before any other part of his feet. 
line 26443=>     For a moment Treebeard stood under the rain of the falling  spring, and 
line 26444=>took a deep breath;  then he laughed, and passed inside. A great stone table 
line 26445=>stood there, but  no chairs. At  the back of the  bay  it was already  quite 
line 26446=>dark. Treebeard lifted two  great  vessels and stood them on the table. They 
line 26447=>seemed to  be  filled with water;  but he  held  his  hands over  them,  and 
line 26448=>immediately they began to glow,  one with a golden and the other with a rich 
line 26449=>green light; and  the blending of the two lights lit the bay; as  if the sun 
line 26450=>of  summer  was  shining through a roof of young  leaves. Looking back,  the 
line 26451=>hobbits saw that the trees in  the court had also begun to glow,  faintly at 
line 26452=>first, but steadily quickening, until  every leaf was edged with light: some 
line 26453=>green,  some gold, some red as  copper; while  the  tree-trunks  looked like 
line 26454=>pillars moulded out of luminous stone. 
line 26455=>     'Well, well, now we can talk again,' said Treebeard. 'You are thirsty I 
line 26456=>expect. Perhaps you are also tired. Drink this!' He went to the  back of the 
line 26457=>bay, and  then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there, with heavy 
line 26458=>lids. He removed  one of the lids, and dipped  in a great ladle, and with it 
line 26459=>filled three bowls, one very large bowl, and two smaller ones.  
line 26460=>     'This is an ent-house,' he said, 'and there are no seats, I  fear.  But 
line 26461=>you may sit on the table.'  Picking  up the hobbits he set them on the great 
line 26462=>stone  slab, six feet  above the  ground, and there they  sat dangling their 
line 26463=>legs, and drinking in sips. 
line 26464=>
line 26465=>####-     The  drink was  like water, indeed very like  the taste of the draughts 
line 26466=>they had drunk from the  Entwash near, the borders  of the  forest,  and yet 
line 26467=>there was  some scent or savour in  it which they could not describe: it was 
line 26468=>faint, but it reminded them of  the smell of a distant wood borne  from afar 
line 26469=>by a cool breeze at night. The effect of the  draught began at the toes, and 
line 26470=>rose  steadily  through every limb, bringing  refreshment  and vigour  as it 
line 26471=>coursed upwards, right to the tips of the hair. Indeed the hobbits felt that 
line 26472=>the  hair  on  their heads was actually standing up,  waving and curling and 
line 26473=>growing. As for Treebeard, he first laved his feet  in the basin beyond  the 
line 26474=>arch, and then he  drained his bowl at one draught, one long, slow  draught. 
line 26475=>The hobbits thought he would never stop. 
line 26476=>     At last he  set the bowl down again. 'Ah -- ah,' he sighed. 'Hm,  hoom, 
line 26477=>now we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and  I will lie down; that 
line 26478=>will prevent this drink from rising to my head and sending me to sleep.' 
line 26479=>     On the right side of  the  bay there  was a great bed on low legs;  not 
line 26480=>more than a couple of feet high,  covered  deep in dried grass  and bracken. 
line 26481=>Treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of 
line 26482=>bending at his  middle),  until he lay at full  length, with his arms behind 
line 26483=>his head, looking up at the ceiling. upon which lights were flickering, like 
line 26484=>the  play of leaves  in the sunshine. Merry  and Pippin  sat  beside him  on 
line 26485=>pillows of grass.  
line 26486=>     'Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!' said Treebeard. 
line 26487=>     The hobbits began to tell him the story of their  adventures ever since 
line 26488=>they left Hobbiton. They followed  no very clear order, for they interrupted 
line 26489=>one another continually, and Treebeard often stopped the  speaker, and  went 
line 26490=>back to some earlier point, or  jumped forward asking questions  about later  
line 26491=>events. They said  nothing whatever about the Ring, and did not tell him why 
line 26492=>they set  out or  where they  were going to;  and he  did not  ask  for  any 
line 26493=>reasons.  
line 26494=>     He  was  immensely interested in  everything: in  the  Black Riders, in 
line 26495=>Elrond, and Rivendell, in the Old Forest, and  Tom Bombadil, in the Mines of 
line 26496=>Moria, and in Lothlurien  and Galadriel. He made them describe the Shire and 
line 26497=>its country over and over  again. He  said an odd thing at  this point.  'You 
line 26498=>never see any, hm, any Ents round  there do you?' he asked. 'Well, not Ents,  
line 26499=>Entwives I should really say.' 
line 26500=>     'Entwives?' said Pippin. 'Are they like you at all?' 
line 26501=>     Yes,  hm,  well   no:  I  do  not  really  know   now,  said  Treebeard 
line 26502=>
line 26503=>####-thoughtfully. 'But they would like your country, so I just wondered.' 
line 26504=>     Treebeard  was  however   especially  interested   in  everything  that 
line 26505=>concerned Gandalf;  and  most  interested of  all  in Saruman's  doings. The 
line 26506=>hobbits  regretted  very much that  they  knew so little  about them: only a  
line 26507=>rather  vague report by Sam of what Gandalf had told  the Council.  But they  
line 26508=>were clear  at  any rate that  Ugl®k and  his troop  came from Isengard, and 
line 26509=>spoke of Saruman as their master. 
line 26510=>     'Hm, hoom!'  said  Treebeard,  when at last  their story  had wound and 
line 26511=>wandered  down to the battle of the Orcs  and  the Riders  of Rohan.  'Well, 
line 26512=>well! That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me  all, no 
line 26513=>indeed, not by a long way. But I do not doubt that you a re  doing as Gandalf 
line 26514=>would wish. There is something very  big going on, that I can see, and  what 
line 26515=>it is maybe I shall learn  in good time, or in bad time. By  root  and twig, 
line 26516=>but  it  is a strange business: up sprout a  little folk that are not in the 
line 26517=>old lists,  and behold  the Nine forgotten Riders reappear to hunt them, and 
line 26518=>Gandalf takes them  on a great journey, and Galadriel harbours them in Caras 
line 26519=>Galadhon, and Orcs pursue them down all the  leagues  of Wilderland:  indeed 
line 26520=>they seem to be caught up in a great storm. I hope they weather it!' 
line 26521=>     'And what about yourself?' asked Merry. 
line 26522=>     'Hoom, hm, I have not troubled  about the  Great Wars,' said Treebeard; 
line 26523=>'they mostly concern Elves and Men. That is the business of Wizards: Wizards 
line 26524=>are always troubled  about the future.  I  do not like  worrying  about  the 
line 26525=>future. I am not  altogether on anybody's side, because nobody is altogether  
line 26526=>on my  side, if you understand me: nobody cares  for the woods as I care for  
line 26527=>them, not even  Elves nowadays. Still,  I  take more kindly to Elves than  to 
line 26528=>others: it was the Elves that cured us of  dumbness long ago, and that was a  
line 26529=>great gift that cannot be forgotten, though our  ways have parted since. And 
line 26530=>there are  some things, of  course, whose side I am altogether not  on; I am 
line 26531=>against  them altogether: these -- burbrum' (he again  made a deep rumble of 
line 26532=>disgust)' -- these Orcs, and their masters.  
line 26533=>     'I  used to  be  anxious  when the shadow lay on Mirkwood, but when  it 
line 26534=>removed to Mordor, I did not trouble for a while : Mordor is a long way away. 
line 26535=>But it seems that the wind is setting  East,  and the withering of all woods 
line 26536=>may  be  drawing near.  There is naught that an old Ent can  do to hold back  
line 26537=>that storm: he must weather it or crack. 
line 26538=>     'But Saruman now! Saruman is a neighbour: I cannot overlook him. I must  
line 26539=>do something. I suppose. I have often wondered lately what I should do about 
line 26540=>
line 26541=>####-Saruman.' 
line 26542=>     'Who is  Saruman?'  asked  Pippin.  'Do  you know  anything  about  his 
line 26543=>history?'  'Saruman is  a  Wizard,' answered Treebeard.  'More  than  that I 
line 26544=>cannot say. I do not know the history of Wizards. They  appeared first after  
line 26545=>the Great Ships came over the Sea; but if they came with  the Ships  I never  
line 26546=>can tell. Saruman was  reckoned great among them.  I  believe.  He  gave  up 
line 26547=>wandering  about and minding the  affairs of Men and Elves, some time ago -- 
line 26548=>you would call it a very long time ago: and he settled down at Angrenost, or  
line 26549=>Isengard  as the Men of Rohan call  it. He was very quiet to begin with, but 
line 26550=>his fame began to gr ow. He was  chosen to be head of the White Council, they 
line 26551=>say; but that did not turn out too well. I wonder now  if even  then Saruman 
line 26552=>was not turning to evil ways. But at any  rate he used to give no trouble to 
line 26553=>his neighbours. I used to talk to him.  There was a time when  he was always 
line 26554=>walking about my woods. He was polite in  those days, always asking my leave 
line 26555=>(at  least when he  met me); and always  eager  to  listen. I told him  many 
line 26556=>things that he would never have found out by himself; but he never repaid me 
line 26557=>in like kind. I  cannot remember that he ever told.  me anything. And he got 
line 26558=>more and more like that; his face, as I remember  it-I  have not seen it for  
line 26559=>many  a  day-became  like windows  in  a stone  wall: windows with  shutters 
line 26560=>inside. 
line 26561=>     'I think  that I now understand  what he is  up  to. He  is plotting to 
line 26562=>become a Power. He has a mind of metal and wheels;  and he does not care for  
line 26563=>growing things, except as far as they serve him for the  moment.  And now it 
line 26564=>is clear that he is a  black traitor. He has taken up  with  foul folk, with 
line 26565=>the Orcs. Brm,  hoom! Worse than that: he  has been doing something to them; 
line 26566=>something dangerous. For these Isengarders are more like wicked Men. It is a 
line 26567=>mark of evil things that came in the Great  Darkness  that they cannot abide 
line 26568=>the Sun;  but Saruman's  Orcs  can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder  
line 26569=>what he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of 
line 26570=>Orcs and Men? That would be a black evil!' 
line 26571=>     Treebeard  rumbled for a moment, as if he  were pronouncing some  deep, 
line 26572=>subterranean Entish malediction. 'Some  time ago I began to wonder  how Orcs 
line 26573=>dared to pass  through my woods so  freely,'  he went on. 'Only lately did I 
line 26574=>guess that  Saruman was to blame, and that  long ago he had been spying  out 
line 26575=>all the ways, and discovering  my secrets. He and his  foul folk are  making 
line 26576=>havoc now. Down on the borders  they are  felling  trees-good trees. Some of 
line 26577=>the trees they just cut down and leave to rot -- orc-mischief that; but most  
line 26578=>
line 26579=>####-are hewn up and  carried off to feed  the fires of Orthanc. There is always a  
line 26580=>smoke rising from Isengard these days.  
line 26581=>     'Curse  him, root and branch!  Many  of those  trees  were  my  friends 
line 26582=>creatures I had known from nut and acorn; many had voices of their  own that 
line 26583=>are lost for ever now. And there are wastes of stump  and bramble where once 
line 26584=>there were singing groves. I have been idle. I have let things slip. It must 
line 26585=>stop!' 
line 26586=>     Treebeard raised  himself  from  his  bed  with a jerk,  stood  up, and 
line 26587=>thumped his hand on the table. The vessels of light trembled and sent up two  
line 26588=>jets  of  flame.  There  was a flicker like green fire in his  eyes, and his 
line 26589=>beard stood out stiff as a great besom. 
line 26590=>     'I will  stop it!' he boomed. 'And  you shall come  with me. You may be 
line 26591=>able  to help me. You will be helping your own friends that way, too; for if 
line 26592=>Saruman is not checked Rohan and Gondor will have an enemy behind as well 
line 26593=>as 
line 26594=>in front. Our roads go together -- to Isengard!' 
line 26595=>     'We will come with you,' said Merry. 'We will do wha t we can.' 
line 26596=>     'Yes!' said  Pippin. 'I should like to see the White Hand overthrown. I 
line 26597=>should like  to be there, even if I could not  be of much use: I shall never  
line 26598=>forget Ugl®k and the crossing of Rohan.' 
line 26599=>     'Good! Good!'  said  Treebeard. 'But I spoke   hastily. We must  not  be 
line 26600=>hasty. I have become too hot. I must cool myself and think; fur it is easier 
line 26601=>to shout stop! than to do it.' 
line 26602=>     He strode to the archway and stood for some time under the falling rain 
line 26603=>of the spring. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the  drops of 
line 26604=>water fell glittering from him to the ground they glinted like red and green 
line 26605=>sparks. He came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent. 
line 26606=>     After some time the hobbits heard him murmuring  again. He seemed to be 
line 26607=>counting  on his fingers. 'Fangorn,  Finglas, Fladrif, aye, aye,' he sighed. 
line 26608=>'The trouble is  that there are so  few of us left,' he said turning towards 
line 26609=>the hobbits. 'Only  three remain of the first Ents that walked in the  woods 
line 26610=>before  the  Darkness: only myself, Fangorn, and  Finglas  and Fladrif  -- to 
line 26611=>give them their Elvish names; you may call them Leaflock and Skinbark if you  
line 26612=>like that better. And of us three Leaflock and Skinbark are not much use for  
line 26613=>this business. Leaflock has grown sleepy. almost  tree-ish, you might say: he 
line 26614=>has taken to standing by himself half-asleep all through the summer with the 
line 26615=>deep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy hair he is. He 
line 26616=>
line 26617=>####-used to rouse up in winter; but of late he has been  too drowsy to walk   far 
line 26618=>even then.  Skinbark  lived on the mountain-slopes west of Isengard. That is 
line 26619=>where the worst  trouble  has been. He was wounded by the Orcs,  and many of 
line 26620=>his folk and his tree-herds have been murdered and destroyed. He has gone up 
line 26621=>into the high places, among the birches that he loves  best, and he will not 
line 26622=>come down. Still,  I  daresay I  could get  together a fair company  of  our 
line 26623=>younger folks-if  I could make  them understand the  need: if I could  rouse 
line 26624=>them: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity the re are so few of us!' 
line 26625=>     'Why are there so few  when  you  have  lived in this country so long?' 
line 26626=>asked Pippin. 'Have a great many died?' 
line 26627=>     'Oh, no!' said Treebeard. 'None  have died from  inside, as  you  might 
line 26628=>say. Some have  fallen in the evil chances of the long years, of course: and 
line 26629=>more have  grown tree-ish. But  there were never many of us and we have  not 
line 26630=>increased. There have been no Entings  -- no children, you would say, not for  
line 26631=>a terrible long count of years. You see, we lost the Entwives.' 
line 26632=>     'How very sad!' said Pippin. 'How was it that they all died?' 
line 26633=>     'They did not die!' said Treebeard. 'I never said died. We lost them, I 
line 26634=>said. We lost them and we cannot find them.' He sighed. 'I thought most folk  
line 26635=>knew that. There were songs about the hunt of the Ents for the Entwives sung 
line 26636=>among  Elves  and  Men  from  Mirkwood  to  Gondor.  They  cannot  be  quite 
line 26637=>forgotten.' 
line 26638=>     'Well, I  am  afraid the songs have not come west over the Mountains to 
line 26639=>the Shire,'  said Merry. 'Won't you tell us some more, or sing us one of the 
line 26640=>songs?' 
line 26641=>     'Yes, I will indeed,' said Treebeard, seeming pleased with the request. 
line 26642=>'But  I  cannot  tell it properly, only in short; and then  we  must end our 
line 26643=>talk: tomorrow we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey 
line 26644=>to begin.' 
line 26645=>     'It is rather a strange and sad story,' he went on after a pause. 'When 
line 26646=>the  world  was young, and the woods were  wide  and wild,  the Ents and the 
line 26647=>Entwives  --  and  there  were  Entmaidens  then:  ah!   the  loveliness  of 
line 26648=>Fimbrethil, of Wandlimb the  lightfooted, in the days of our  youth! -- they 
line 26649=>walked  together  and they  housed together.  But our  hearts did not  go on 
line 26650=>growing in the same way: the Ents gave their love to things that they met in 
line 26651=>the world, and the Entwives gave their thought to other things, for the Ents 
line 26652=>loved the great trees; and the wild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; 
line 26653=>and they drank of the mountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees 
line 26654=>
line 26655=>####-let fall in their path;  and they learned of  the Elves and  spoke  with the 
line 26656=>Trees. But  the Entwives gave their  minds to the  lesser trees, and to  the 
line 26657=>meads in the sunshine  beyond the feet of the forests; and they saw the sloe 
line 26658=>in the thicket, and  the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in spring, and 
line 26659=>the green herbs in the waterlands in summer, and the seeding grasses in  the 
line 26660=>autumn  fields. They  did  not desire  to  speak with these things; but they 
line 26661=>wished  them to  hear and obey what was said to  them. The  Entwives ordered 
line 26662=>them to  grow  according to  their wishes, and bear leaf and fruit to  their 
line 26663=>liking; for the Entwives desired order, and plenty, and peace (by which they 
line 26664=>meant that things should remain  where they had set them).  So the  Entwives 
line 26665=>made gardens to live in. But  we Ents went on wandering, and we only came to 
line 26666=>the gardens  now and again. Then when the  Darkness came  in  the North, the 
line 26667=>Entwives crossed  the Great  River, and made new  gardens,  and  tilled  new 
line 26668=>fields, and  we saw  them more seldom. After the Darkness was overthrown the 
line 26669=>land of the Entwives blossomed richly,  and their  fields were full of corn. 
line 26670=>Many men learned the crafts of  the  Entwives and honoured them greatly; but 
line 26671=>we were only a legend to them, a secret in the heart of the forest. Yet here 
line 26672=>we still are,  while  all  the gardens of the Entwives are  wasted: Men call 
line 26673=>them the Brown Lands now. 
line 26674=>     'I remember it was  long ago --  in the time of  the war between Sauron 
line 26675=>and the Men of the Sea -- desire came over me to see Fimbrethil  again. Very 
line 26676=>fair she was still in my eyes, when I had last seen her, though  little like 
line 26677=>the  Entmaiden  of old.  For  the Entwives were bent  and  browned  by their  
line 26678=>labour; their hair  parched  by the sun to the hue  of ripe corn  and  their 
line 26679=>cheeks  like  red apples.  Yet their eyes were still  the eyes  of  our  own 
line 26680=>people.  We  crossed  over Anduin and came to  their  land:  but  we found a  
line 26681=>desert: it was all  burned and uprooted, for war had passed over it. But the 
line 26682=>Entwives were not there. Long  we called, and long we searched; and we asked 
line 26683=>all  folk  that  we  met which way the Entwives had gone. Some said they had 
line 26684=>never seen them;  and  some said that they had seen them walking  away west, 
line 26685=>and some said east, and others south. But nowhere that we went could we find 
line 26686=>them. Our sorrow was very great. Yet the wild  wood called, and we  returned 
line 26687=>to it. For many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the 
line 26688=>Entwives.  walking far and wide and  calling  them by their beautiful names.  
line 26689=>But as time passed we went  more  seldom and  wandered less far. And now the 
line 26690=>Entwives are only a memory for us, and our  beards  are  long and  grey. The 
line 26691=>Elves made many songs concerning the Search of  the  Ents,  and some of  the 
line 26692=>
line 26693=>####-songs passed into the tongues of  Men. But we made  no songs about it, being 
line 26694=>content to chant  their beautiful names when we thought of the Entwives.  We 
line 26695=>believe that we may meet again in  a time to come, and perhaps we shall find 
line 26696=>somewhere  a  land where we can live together and both be content. But it is 
line 26697=>foreboded  that tha t will only be  when we have  both  lost all  that we now 
line 26698=>have.  And  it may  well be that that time is  drawing near at last. For  if 
line 26699=>Sauron of old destroyed the gardens, the Enemy today seems likely  to wither 
line 26700=>all the woods.  
line 26701=>     'There  was  an Elvish  song  that  spoke  of this, or at  least  so  I 
line 26702=>understand  it. It used to be sung up and down the Great River. It was never 
line 26703=>an Entish song, mark you: it would have been a very long song in Entish! But 
line 26704=>we  know it by heart, and  hum it now and again. This  is how it runs in your 
line 26705=>tongue: 
line 26706=>     ENT. 
line 26707=>     When Spring unfolds the beechen leaf, and sap is in the bough; 
line 26708=>     When light is on the wild-wood stream, and wind is on the brow;

line 26727=>     When honey spills, and apple swells, though wind be in the West, 
line 26728=>     I'll linger here beneath the Sun, because my land is best!

line 26732=>     When Winter comes, the winter wild that hill and wood shall slay; 
line 26733=>     When trees shall fall and starless night devour the sunless day; 
line 26734=>     When wind is in the deadly East, then in the bitter rain  
line 26735=>     I'll look for thee, and call to thee; I'll come to thee again!

line 26737=>     entwife. 
line 26738=>     When Winter comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last; 
line 26739=>     When broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past; 
line 26740=>     I'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again: 
line 26741=>     Together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain! 
line 26742=> 
line 26743=>     both. 
line 26744=>     Together we will take the road that leads into the West, 
line 26745=>     And far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest.' 
line 26746=> 
line 26747=>     Treebeard ended  his song.  'That  is  how it goes,'  he  said.  'It is 
line 26748=>Elvish, of course: lighthearted, quickworded, and soon over. I daresay it is 
line 26749=>fair  enough. But the Ents could say  more on their side,  if they had time! 
line 26750=>But now I am going to stand  up  and  take  a little sleep.  Where  will you  
line 26751=>stand?' 
line 26752=>     'We usually  lie down to  sleep,' said Merry.  'We  shall  be all right 
line 26753=>where we are.' 
line 26754=>     'Lie down to sleep!' said Treebeard. 'Why of course you do! Hm, hoom: I  
line 26755=>was  forgetting:  singing that song  put  me in mind  of  old times;  almost  
line 26756=>thought that I was talking to young Entings, I did. Well, you can lie on the 
line 26757=>bed. I am going to stand in the rain. Good night!' 
line 26758=>     Merry  and Pippin climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass 
line 26759=>and fern. It was fresh,  and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights died  down, 
line 26760=>and the glow of the trees faded; but outside  under  the arch they could see 
line 26761=>old Treebeard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head. The 
line 26762=>bright stars peered out of the sky, and lit the falling water as  it spilled 
line 26763=>on to his fingers  and head,  and  dripped, dripped, in  hundreds  of silver 
line 26764=>drops on to  his  feet. Listening to the tinkling of  the drops  the hobbits 
line 26765=>fell asleep. 
line 26766=>     They  woke to find a cool sun  shining into the great court, and on  to 
line 26767=>the floor of the bay. Shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff 
line 26768=>
line 26769=>####-easterly wind. Treebeard was not to be seen; but while Merry and Pippin were 
line 26770=>bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and  singing, as he 
line 26771=>came up the path between the trees.  
line 26772=>     'Hoo, ho! Good morning, Merry and Pippin!' he boomed, when he saw 
line 26773=>them. 
line 26774=>'You  sleep long. I have  been many a hundred  strides already today. Now we 
line 26775=>will have a drink, and go to Entmoot.' 
line 26776=>     He  poured  them  out two  full bowls  from a  stone  jar;  but  from a  
line 26777=>different jar. The taste was not the same  as it  had been the night before: 
line 26778=>it was earthier and  richer, more sustaining and  food-like,  so  to  speak. 
line 26779=>While the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of  the bed, and nibbling small 
line 26780=>pieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a  necessary part 
line 26781=>of breakfast than  because they  felt  hungry), Treebeard stood,  humming in 
line 26782=>Entish or Elvish or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky. 
line 26783=>     'Where is Entmoot?' Pippin ventured to ask. 
line 26784=>     'Hoo, eh? Entmoot?' said Treebeard, turning round. 'It is not a  place, 
line 26785=>it  is a  gathering of Ents  --  which does not often happen nowadays.  But I 
line 26786=>have  managed  to make a fair number  promise to come.  We shall meet in the 
line 26787=>place  where we have always met: Derndingle  Men  call it.  It is away south 
line 26788=>from here. We must be there before noon.' 
line 26789=>     Before long they set off. Treebeard carried the  hobbits in his arms as 
line 26790=>on the previous day. At  the entrance to  the court he turned  to the right, 
line 26791=>stepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along  the feet of great 
line 26792=>tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets 
line 26793=>of birch and rowan, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods.  Soon 
line 26794=>Treebeard 
line 26795=>turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves,  where the 
line 26796=>trees were  larger, taller, and  thicker  than any that the hobbits had ever 
line 26797=>seen before. For a  while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they 
line 26798=>had  noticed when  they  first ventured into Fangorn,  but it  soon  passed. 
line 26799=>Treebeard  did   not  talk  to  them.  He   hummed  to  himself  deeply  and 
line 26800=>thoughtfully,  but Merry and Pippin caught no proper words: it sounded  like 
line 26801=>boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, dahrar boom boom, dahrar 
line 26802=>boom,  and 
line 26803=>so on with  a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought 
line 26804=>they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed  to come out of 
line 26805=>the earth, or  from boughs above  their heads, or perhaps  from the boles of 
line 26806=>
line 26807=>####-the trees; but Treebeard did not stop or turn his head to either side. 
line 26808=>     They had been going for a  long while  -- Pippin had tried to keep count 
line 26809=>of the 'ent-strides' but had failed, getting lost at about three thousand -- 
line 26810=>when  Treebeard  began to  slacken his pace. Suddenly he  stopped,  put  the 
line 26811=>hobbits down, and raised his curled  hands to his mouth so that they  made a  
line 26812=>hollow tube; then he blew or called through them. A great hoom, hom rang out 
line 26813=>like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed  to echo  from the trees.  
line 26814=>Far off there came from  several directions  a similar  hoom, hom, hoom that 
line 26815=>was not an echo but an answer. 
line 26816=>     Treebeard  now perched Merry and Pippin on his shoulders  and strode on 
line 26817=>again, every now and then sending out another horn-call,  and each time  the 
line 26818=>answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked 
line 26819=>like an impenetrable  wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the 
line 26820=>hobbits had never seen  before:  they branched out right from the roots, and 
line 26821=>were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and  they bore 
line 26822=>many stiff upright flower -spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.  
line 26823=>     Turning to the  left and skirting this huge hedge  Treebeard  came in a  
line 26824=>few strides to a  narrow entrance. Through it a  worn path passed  and dived 
line 26825=>suddenly down  a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending 
line 26826=>into a great  dingle, almost as round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned  
line 26827=>at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge. It  was smooth and  grassclad 
line 26828=>inside,  and  there were no  trees  except  three  very tall  and  beautiful 
line 26829=>silver -birches that stood at the  bottom  of the bowl.  Two  other paths led 
line 26830=>down into the dingle: from the west and from the east. 
line 26831=>     Several Ents had already arrived.  More were coming  in down the  other  
line 26832=>paths, and  some were now following Treebeard. As they drew near the hobbits 
line 26833=>gazed  at them.  They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like 
line 26834=>Treebeard as  one hobbit is like another (at any  rate to a stranger's eye); 
line 26835=>and they were very much surprised to see nothing of the  kind. The Ents were 
line 26836=>as different from  one another as trees from trees: some as different as one 
line 26837=>tree  is  from  another of the  same  name  but  quite  different growth and 
line 26838=>history; and some as different  as one tree-kind from another, as birch from 
line 26839=>beech; oak from fir. There were a few older Ents,  bearded and gnarled  like 
line 26840=>hale  but  ancient trees (though none looked  as ancient as Treebeard);  and 
line 26841=>there   were  tall  strong  Ents,   clean-limbed  and  smooth-skinned   like 
line 26842=>forest -trees  in  their  prime; but  there were no young Ents, no  saplings. 
line 26843=>Altogether there were about two  dozen standing on the wide grassy  floor of 
line 26844=>
line 26845=>####-the dingle, and as many more were marching in. 
line 26846=>     At first Merry and Pippin were struck chiefly by the variety  that they 
line 26847=>saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and height, and 
line 26848=>length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes  and fingers (anything from 
line 26849=>three to nine). A few seemed more or less related to Treebeard, and reminded 
line 26850=>them of beech-trees  or oaks. But  there were other kinds. Some recalled the 
line 26851=>chestnut: brown-skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands, and short thick 
line 26852=>legs. Some recalled  the  ash:  tall straight grey  Ents  with many-fingered 
line 26853=>hands and long legs; some  the fir (the tallest Ents), and others the birch, 
line 26854=>the  rowan, and the linden.  But when the Ents all gather ed round Treebeard, 
line 26855=>bowing their  heads  slightly, murmuring in  their  slow musical voices, and 
line 26856=>looking long  and intently at the strangers, then the hobbits saw  that they 
line 26857=>were all of the same kindred, and all had  the same eyes: not all so old  or  
line 26858=>so  deep  as Treebeard's,  but  all  with the  same slow, steady, thoughtful 
line 26859=>expression, and the same green flicker. 
line 26860=>     As soon as the  whole company was assembled,  standing in a wide circle  
line 26861=>round  Treebeard, a curious and unintelligible conversation began.  The Ents 
line 26862=>began to murmur slowly: first  one joined and then  another, until they were 
line 26863=>all chanting together in a long rising and falling rhythm, now louder on one 
line 26864=>side  of  the ring, now dying away there and rising to a great boom  on  the 
line 26865=>other  side. Though he could not catch or  understand any of the words  -- he 
line 26866=>supposed the language was Entish  -- Pippin found the  sound very pleasant to 
line 26867=>listen to at first;  but gradually his attention wavered.  After a long time 
line 26868=>(and the  chant showed no signs  of  sla ckening) he found himself wondering, 
line 26869=>since  Entish  was  such  an 'unhasty'  language,  whether they had yet  got 
line 26870=>further than Good Morning; and if  Treebeard  was to call the roll, how many 
line 26871=>days it would take to sing all their names. 'I wonder what the Entish is for  
line 26872=>yes or no,' he thought. He yawned. 
line 26873=>     Treebeard  was immediately  aware  of him. 'Hm, ha, hey, my Pippin!' he 
line 26874=>said,  and the other Ents all stopped their chant. 'You are a hasty folk,  I 
line 26875=>was forgetting; and anyway it is  wearisome listening to a speech you do not 
line 26876=>understand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the Entmoot, 
line 26877=>and 
line 26878=>they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not Orcs, and  that  a  
line 26879=>new line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that 
line 26880=>is quick work for an Entmoot. You and Merry  can stroll about in the dingle, 
line 26881=>if you like.  There is  a well of  good water, if you  need refreshing, away 
line 26882=>
line 26883=>####-yonder in the north bank.  There are still  some  words  to speak before the 
line 26884=>Moot really begins.  I will come  and see you again, and tell you how things 
line 26885=>are going.' 
line 26886=>     He put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed  low. This 
line 26887=>feat  seemed  to amuse  the Ents very much, to judge by the  tone  of  their 
line 26888=>murmurs, and the flicker of their  eyes; but they soon turned  back to their 
line 26889=>own  business. Merry  and Pippin  climbed up the path that came in from  the 
line 26890=>west, and looked  through the opening in the  great  hedge.  Long  tree-clad 
line 26891=>slopes  rose  from  the  lip of  the dingle, and away beyond them, above the 
line 26892=>fir-trees of the furthest  ridge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of  a  
line 26893=>high  mountain.  Southwards to their left they could see the forest  falling 
line 26894=>away  down  into  the  grey distance. There far  away there was a pale green 
line 26895=>glimmer that Merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of Rohan. 
line 26896=>     'I wonder where Isengard is?' said Pippin. 
line 26897=>     'I  don't  know quite where  we are,'  said  Merry;  'but that peak  is 
line 26898=>probably Methedras. and as far  as I can remember the  ring of Isengard lies 
line 26899=>in a  fork or deep cleft  at the end of the  mountains. It  is probably down 
line 26900=>behind this  great ridge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left 
line 26901=>of the peak, don't you think?' 
line 26902=>     'What  is Isengard like?' said Pippin. 'I wonder what Ents can do a bout 
line 26903=>it anyway.'  'So do I,' said Merry.  'Isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or  
line 26904=>hills, I think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock  in 
line 26905=>the  middle, called Orthanc. Saruman has  a tower  on  it. There  is a gate, 
line 26906=>perhaps  more  than   one, in the encircling wall,  and I  believe there is a  
line 26907=>stream running  through it; it  comes  out  of  the  mountains, and flows on 
line 26908=>across the Gap  of  Rohan. It does not seem the  sort  of place for  Ents to 
line 26909=>tackle.  But I  have an odd feeling  about these Ents: somehow I don't think  
line 26910=>they are quite as safe and, well funny as  they seem. They seem slow, queer, 
line 26911=>and  patient, almost  sad; and yet I believe  they could  be roused.  If that 
line 26912=>happened, I would rather not be on the other side.' 
line 26913=>     'Yes!' said  Pippin.  'I  know  what you mean.  There might be  all the 
line 26914=>difference between an old cow sitting and  thoughtfully chewing, and a  bull  
line 26915=>charging; and the change might come  suddenly.  I wonder  if  Treebeard will 
line 26916=>rouse them. I am sure he means to  try.  Bu t they don't like  being  roused. 
line 26917=>Treebeard got roused himself last night, and then bottled it up again.' 
line 26918=>     The hobbits turned back.  The voices of the Ents were still  rising and 
line 26919=>falling in their  conclave. The sun had now risen high  enough to look  over 
line 26920=>
line 26921=>####-the high hedge: it gleamed on the tops of  the birches and lit the northward 
line 26922=>side of the  dingle  with  a  cool yellow  light.  There they  saw  a little 
line 26923=>glittering fountain. They walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet 
line 26924=>of the evergreens-it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again, 
line 26925=>and  not to  be in a hurry-and then they climbed down  to the gushing water.  
line 26926=>They drank a little,  a clean, cold, sharp  draught, and sat down on a mossy 
line 26927=>stone,  watching the  patches of  sun  on the grass and the shadows  of  the 
line 26928=>sailing clouds passing over the  floor of the dingle. The murmur of the Ents 
line 26929=>went on. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and 
line 26930=>far from everything  that had ever  happened  to  them. A great longing  came 
line 26931=>over them for the faces and voices of their companions. especially for Frodo 
line 26932=>and Sam, and for Strider. 
line 26933=>     At last there came  a pause in the  Ent-voices; and looking up they saw 
line 26934=>Treebeard coming towards them. with another Ent at his side. 
line 26935=>     'Hm, hoom, here I am again,' said Treebeard. 'Are you getting weary, or 
line 26936=>feeling  impatient,  hmm,  eh? Well, I  am  afraid  that  you  must  not get 
line 26937=>impatient yet. We have finished the first stage now; but I have still got to 
line 26938=>explain things again to those that live a  long  way off, far from Isengard, 
line 26939=>and those that I could not get round to before the Moot, and  after that  we 
line 26940=>shall have to decide  what to do. However, deciding what to do does not take 
line 26941=>Ents so  long as going over all the facts  and events that  they have to make 
line 26942=>up their  minds  about. Still, it is no use denying, we shall be here a long 
line 26943=>time yet: a couple of  days very likely. So I  have brought you a companion.  
line 26944=>He  has an ent-house nearby.  Bregalad  is his  Elvish name. He says  he has 
line 26945=>already made up his mind and does not need to remain at the Moot. Hm, hm, he 
line 26946=>is the nearest thing among us to a hasty Ent. You ought  to get on together. 
line 26947=>Good-bye!' Treebeard turned and left them. 
line 26948=>     Bregalad  stood for some  time surveying the hobbits solemnly; and they  
line 26949=>looked at him, wondering when he would show any signs of 'hastiness'. He was 
line 26950=>tall, and seemed to be one of the  younger Ents;  he had smooth shining skin 
line 26951=>on  his arms and legs; his lips  were ruddy, and his hair was grey-green. He 
line 26952=>could bend and  sway like a slender tree in the wind. At last  he spoke, and 
line 26953=>his voice though resonant was higher and clearer than Treebeard's.  
line 26954=>     'Ha, hmm, my friends, let us go  for a walk!' he said. 'I  am Bregalad, 
line 26955=>that  is Quickbeam in your language. But it is on ly  a  nickname, of course. 
line 26956=>They have called me that ever since I said yes to an elder Ent before he had 
line 26957=>finished his question. Also I drink quickly, and go out while some are still 
line 26958=>
line 26959=>####-wetting their beards. Come with me!' 
line 26960=>     He reached down two shapely arms and gave a long -fingered hand to  each 
line 26961=>of  the hobbits. All that day  they  walked  about in  the  woods with  him, 
line 26962=>singing, and laughing; for Quickbeam  often  laughed. He laughed if the  sun 
line 26963=>came out from  behind  a cloud, he laughed  if  they came upon a  stream  or  
line 26964=>spring: then  he stooped  and  splashed  his  feet  and head with water;  he 
line 26965=>laughed sometimes  at some sound or whisper in  the trees. Whenever he saw a  
line 26966=>rowan-tree he halted a  while  with  his  arms stretched out,  and sang, and 
line 26967=>swayed as he sang. 
line 26968=>     At  nightfall  he  brought  them to his ent-house:  nothing more than a  
line 26969=>mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank. Rowan-trees grew in a circle 
line 26970=>about it, and there was water  (as in all ent-houses), a spring bubbling out 
line 26971=>from the bank. They  talked for a while as darkness fell on  the forest. Not 
line 26972=>far away  the voices of  the Entmoot  could be heard still going on; but now 
line 26973=>they seemed deeper and less  leisurely,  and every  now  and again one great 
line 26974=>voice would rise in a high and  quickening music,  while all the others died 
line 26975=>away.  But beside them Bregalad  spoke gently  in their  own  tongue, almost 
line 26976=>whispering; and they learned that  he belonged to Skinbark's people, and the  
line 26977=>country where they had lived had been ravaged. That  seemed  to the  hobbits 
line 26978=>quite enough to explain his 'hastiness', at least in the matter of Orcs. 
line 26979=>     'There were rowan-trees in my home,'  said Bregalad,  softly and sadly, 
line 26980=>'rowan-trees that took root when I was an Enting, many many years ago in the 
line 26981=>quiet of the  world. The  oldest were planted by the Ents to try  and please 
line 26982=>the Entwives;  but  they looked at them and smiled and  said  that they knew 
line 26983=>where  whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing. Yet there are no  trees 
line 26984=>of all  that race, the people of the Rose, that are  so beautiful to me. And 
line 26985=>these trees grew and grew, till the  shadow of each  was like a  green hall, 
line 26986=>and  their red  berries in the  autumn  were  a burden,  and a beauty  and a  
line 26987=>wonder. Birds used to flock there. I like birds, even when they chatter; and 
line 26988=>the  rowan has enough  and  to  spare. But  the birds became  unfriendly and 
line 26989=>greedy  and tore at the trees, and threw  the fruit down and did not eat it. 
line 26990=>Then  Orcs came  with axes and cut down my trees. I came  and called them by 
line 26991=>their long names, but they did not quiver, they did not hear or answer: they 
line 26992=>lay dead. 
line 26993=>     O Orofarnl, Lassemista, Carnimnril! 
line 26994=>     O rowan fair, upon your hair how white the blossom lay! 
line 26995=>     O rowan mine, I saw you shine upon a summer's day, 
line 26996=>
line 26997=>####-     Your rind so bright, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft: 
line 26998=>     Upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft! 
line 26999=>     O rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey; 
line 27000=>     Your crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day. 
line 27001=>     O Orofarnl, Lassemista, Carnimnril! 
line 27002=>     The hobbits  fell asleep to the sound of  the soft singing of Bregalad, 
line 27003=>that seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved. 
line 27004=>     The next day they spent also in his company,  but they  did not  go far 
line 27005=>from his 'house'. Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter  of the 
line 27006=>bank; for  the wind was colder, and  the clouds closer and greyer; there was 
line 27007=>little sunshine,  and in the  distance the voices  of  the Ents at the  Moot 
line 27008=>still  rose  and  fell, sometimes  loud  and strong, sometimes low  and sad, 
line 27009=>sometimes  quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge. A  second night 
line 27010=>came and  still  the  Ents  held conclave under hurrying  clouds  and fitful 
line 27011=>stars. 
line 27012=>     The third day broke, bleak and windy.   At sunrise the Ents' voices rose 
line 27013=>to a great clamour and then died down again. As the morning wore on the wind 
line 27014=>fell  and  the  air grew  heavy with expectancy. The hobbits could  see that 
line 27015=>Bregalad  was now listening intently, although to them,  down in the dell of 
line 27016=>his ent-house, the sound of the Moot was faint. 
line 27017=>     The afternoon came, and the sun, going west towards the mountains. sent 
line 27018=>out  long  yellow beams  between the  cracks  and  fissures of  the  clouds.  
line 27019=>Suddenly they were aware  that  everything wa s very quiet; the  whole forest  
line 27020=>stood in listening silence. Of course, the Ent -voices had stopped.  What did 
line 27021=>that mean? Bregalad was standing up erect and tense, looking back northwards 
line 27022=>towards Derndingle. 
line 27023=>     Then with  a crash came  a great ringing shou t:  ra-hoom-rah! The trees 
line 27024=>quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them. There was another pause, and 
line 27025=>then a  marching  music began like solemn drums, and above the rolling beats 
line 27026=>and booms there welled voices singing high and strong. 
line 27027=>     We come, we come with roll of drum: ta -runda runda runda rom! 
line 27028=>     The Ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song: 
line 27029=>     We come, we come with horn and drum: ta -ryna ryna ryna rom! 
line 27030=>     Bregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house. 
line 27031=>     Before  long  they  saw the  marching  line approaching: the Ents  were 
line 27032=>swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them. Treebeard was 
line 27033=>at  their head,  and  some  fifty followers  were  behind him,  two abreast, 
line 27034=>
line 27035=>####-keeping step with their feet  and beating time  with  their hands upon their 
line 27036=>flanks. As they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen. 
line 27037=>     'Hoom, hom! Here we  come with a  boom, here  we come at last!'  called  
line 27038=>Treebeard when he caught sight of Bregalad  and the hobbits. 'Come, join the 
line 27039=>Moot! We are off. We are off to Isengard!' 
line 27040=>     'To Isengard!' the Ents cried in many voices.  
line 27041=>     'To Isengard!' 
line 27042=>     To Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone; 
line 27043=>     Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone, 
line 27044=>     We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door; 
line 27045=>     For bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars -- we go to war! 
line 27046=>     To land of gloom with tramp  of doom, with  roll  of drum, we come,  we  
line 27047=>come; 
line 27048=>     To Isengard with doom we come! 
line 27049=>     With doom we come, with doom we come! 
line 27050=>     So they sang as they marched southwards. 
line 27051=>     Bregalad, his eyes shining, swung into  the  line beside Treebeard. The 
line 27052=>old Ent  now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and 
line 27053=>so they rode proudly at the head of  the sin ng  company with beating hearts 
line 27054=>and heads held high. Though they ad expected something to happen eventually, 
line 27055=>they were amazed at the change that had come over the Ents. It seemed now as 
line 27056=>sudden  as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike. 
line 27057=>     'The Ents made up  their minds rather quickly, after all, didn't they?' 
line 27058=>Pippin  ventured to  say  after  some time, when  for a  moment  the singing 
line 27059=>paused, and only the beating of hands and feet was heard. 
line 27060=>     'Quickly?' said Treebeard. 'Hoom! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I expected. 
line 27061=>Indeed I have not seen them roused like this for many an age. We Ents do not 
line 27062=>like being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our 
line 27063=>trees  and our  lives  are in  great  danger. That has not happened  in this 
line 27064=>Forest since the wars of Sauron and the Men of the Sea.  It is the orc-work, 
line 27065=>the wanton hewing  -- rbrum --  without even the  bad excuse of  feeding the 
line 27066=>fires, that has so angered us; and the  treachery of a neighbour, who should 
line 27067=>have helped us. Wizards ought to know better: they do know  better. There is 
line 27068=>no curse in  Elvish, Entish, or  the  tongues  of Men bad  enough  for  such 
line 27069=>treachery. Down with Saruman!' 
line 27070=>     'Will you really break the doors of Isengard?' asked Merry. 
line 27071=>     'Ho, hm, well, we could, you know! You do not know, perhaps. how strong 
line 27072=>
line 27073=>####-we are. Maybe you have heard  of Trolls? They  are mighty strong. But Trolls 
line 27074=>are only counterfeits. made by the  Enemy in the Great  Darkness, in mockery 
line 27075=>of Ents, as Orcs were of Elves. We are stronger than Trolls.  We are made of 
line 27076=>the  bones  of  the earth. We can split stone like  the roots of trees, only 
line 27077=>quicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused!  If we  are not hewn down, or  
line 27078=>destroyed  by  fire  or blast  of  sorcery,  we could  split  Isengard  into 
line 27079=>splinters and crack its walls into rubble.' 
line 27080=>     'But Saruman will try to stop you. won't he?' 
line 27081=>     'Hm,  ah, yes, that is so. I  have  not  forgotten  it.  Indeed  I have 
line 27082=>thought long about it. But. you see, many of the Ents are younger than I am.  
line 27083=>by many lives of trees. They  are all  roused now. and  their mind is all on  
line 27084=>one  thing: breaking Isengard.  But they will  start  thinking  again before 
line 27085=>long; they  will  cool down a little.  when we take our evening drink. What a  
line 27086=>thirst we shall have! But let them march now and sing! We have a long way to 
line 27087=>go, and there is time ahead for thought. It is something to have started.' 
line 27088=>     Treebeard marched on, singing with the others for a  while.  But after a  
line 27089=>time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. Pippin could see that 
line 27090=>his old  brow was wrinkled and  knotted.  At  last he  looked up, and Pippin 
line 27091=>could see a sad look in his eyes,  sad but not unhappy. There was a light in 
line 27092=>them, as if   the green  flame had  sunk deeper into the  dark  wells of  his 
line 27093=>thought. 
line 27094=>     'Of course, it  is likely  enough, my friends,' he said slowly, 'likely 
line 27095=>enough that we are going to  our doom: the last march of the Ents. But if we 
line 27096=>stayed at home  and did noth ing, doom would find us anyway, sooner or later. 
line 27097=>That thought has long been  growing in our hearts;  and that is  why we  are 
line 27098=>marching now. It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last march of the 
line 27099=>Ents may  be worth a song.  Aye,'  he sighed, 'we may help the other peoples 
line 27100=>before we pass away. Still, I should have liked to see the  songs come  true 
line 27101=>about the Entwives. I should dearly have liked to  see Fimbrethil again. But 
line 27102=>there, my friends, songs  like trees bear fruit  only  in their own time and 
line 27103=>their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.' 
line 27104=>     The Ents  went  striding  on at a great pace. They had descended into a  
line 27105=>long fold of the land that fell away southward;  now they began to climb up,  
line 27106=>and up, on to the high western  ridge. The woods fell  away and they came to 
line 27107=>scattered groups of birch, and  then  to bare slopes where only  a few gaunt 
line 27108=>pine-trees grew. The sun  sank behind the dark hill -back in front. Grey dusk  
line 27109=>fell. 
line 27110=>
line 27111=>####-     Pippin looked behind. The number of  the Ents had grown -- or  what was 
line 27112=>happening? Where  the dim bare  slopes that  they had crossed should lie, he 
line 27113=>thought he saw groves of trees. But they were  moving! Could it be  that the 
line 27114=>trees of  Fangorn  were awake, and the  forest was rising, marching over the 
line 27115=>hills to war? He rubbed his  eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived 
line 27116=>him; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. There was a noise like 
line 27117=>wind  in many branches. The Ents were  drawing  near the  crest of the ridge 
line 27118=>now, and all song had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing was 
line 27119=>to be  heard save a faint quiver of the earth beneath the  feet of the Ents,  
line 27120=>and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of  many  drifting  leaves. At  last  
line 27121=>they stood upon the summit, and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft  
line 27122=>at the end of the mountains: Nan Curunnr, the Valley of Saruman. 
line 27123=>     'Night lies over Isengard,' said Treebeard. 
line 27124=> 
line 27125=>
line 27126=>####- 
line 27127=>
line 27128=>Chapter 5. The White Rider 
line 27129=>
line 27130=> 
line 27131=> 
line 27132=>     'My very bones are chilled,' said Gimli, flapping his arms and stamping 
line 27133=>his  feet.  Day  had  come at last.  At dawn  the companions  had made  such 
line 27134=>breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to  
line 27135=>search the ground again for signs of the hobbits. 
line 27136=>     'And do not forget that old man!' said Gimli. 'I should be happier if I 
line 27137=>could see the print of a boot.' 
line 27138=>     'Why would that make you happy?' said Legolas.  
line 27139=>     'Because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he 
line 27140=>seemed,' answered the Dwarf.  
line 27141=>     'Maybe,' said the Elf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the 
line 27142=>grass is deep and springy.' 
line 27143=>     'That would not  baffle a Ranger,' said Gimli.  'A bent blade is enough 
line 27144=>for Aragorn to read.  But I do not expect  him to find any traces. It was an 
line 27145=>evil phantom of Saruman that we saw last night.  I am sure of it, even under  
line 27146=>the light of morning. His eyes are looking out on us from Fangorn even  now,  
line 27147=>maybe.' 
line 27148=>     'It is likely enough,' said  Aragorn; 'yet I am not sure. I am thinking 
line 27149=>of the horses. You said last night, Gimli, that they were scared away. Bu t I 
line 27150=>did not think so. Did  you hear  them, Legolas? Did they  sound to you  like 
line 27151=>beasts in terror?' 
line 27152=>     'No,' said Legolas. 'I heard them clearly. But for the darkness and our 
line 27153=>own  fear I should have guessed that they  were beasts wild with some sudden 
line 27154=>gladness.  They spoke as horses will when they meet a friend  that they have 
line 27155=>long missed.' 
line 27156=>     'So I thought,'  said  Aragorn; 'but I  cannot  read the riddle, unless 
line 27157=>they return. Come! The  light  is growing fast. Let  us look first and guess 
line 27158=>later! We should  begin here,  near  to  our own  camping-ground,  searching  
line 27159=>carefully all about, and working  up  the slope  towards the forest. To find 
line 27160=>the  hobbits is  our  errand, whatever we may think of  our  visitor in  the 
line 27161=>night. If  they  escaped by some chance,  then they  must have hidden in the 
line 27162=>trees, or they would have been seen. If we find nothing between here and the 
line 27163=>eaves of the wood, then we will make a last search upon the battle-field and  
line 27164=>among the ashes. But there  is little hope there:  the horsemen  of Rohan did 
line 27165=>
line 27166=>####-their work too well.' 
line 27167=>     For some  time the companions crawled and groped upon  the  ground. The 
line 27168=>tree stood  mournfully above  them, its  dry  leaves now hanging  limp,  and  
line 27169=>rattling in the chill  easterly wind. Aragorn moved  slowly away. He came to  
line 27170=>the ashes of the watch-fire  near the river -bank, and then  began to retrace 
line 27171=>the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought. Suddenly 
line 27172=>he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. Then he called to 
line 27173=>the others. They came running up. 
line 27174=>     'Here at  last we find  news!' said Aragorn. He lifted up a broken leaf 
line 27175=>for them  to see,  a large  pale leaf of golden  hue, now fading and turning 
line 27176=>brown. 'Here is a mallorn-leaf  of Lurien, and there are small crumbs on it, 
line 27177=>and a  few more crumbs in the grass.  And  see! there are  some pieces of cut 
line 27178=>cord lying nearby!' 
line 27179=>     'And here is  the knife that cut them!' said Gimli. He stooped and drew 
line 27180=>out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged  
line 27181=>blade. The  haft from  which it  had  been snapped was beside it. 'It was an 
line 27182=>orc-weapon,'  he said,  holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the 
line 27183=>carved handle: it  had been shaped like  a hideous  head with squinting eyes 
line 27184=>and leering mouth. 
line 27185=>     'Well, here is  the strangest riddle that we have yet found!' exclaimed 
line 27186=>Legolas.  'A  bound  prisoner  escapes  both from  the  Orcs  and  from  the 
line 27187=>surrounding horsemen.  He  then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his 
line 27188=>bonds with an orc-knife. But how and why?  For if his legs were tied, how did 
line 27189=>he walk? And if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? And if neither  
line 27190=>were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? Being pleased with his skill, he 
line 27191=>then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! That at least is enough to show 
line 27192=>that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that,  I  suppose,  he 
line 27193=>turned his arms into  wings and flew away singing into the trees. It  should 
line 27194=>be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!' 
line 27195=>     'There was sorcery here right enough,' said  Gimli. 'What was that  old 
line 27196=>man doing? What have you to say, Aragorn, to the reading of Legolas. Can you  
line 27197=>better it?' 
line 27198=>     'Maybe,  I could,' said Aragorn, smiling.  'There are  some other signs 
line 27199=>near at hand  that  you have not considered. I agree that the prisoner was a  
line 27200=>hobbit and must have had either legs  or hands free, before he came  here. I 
line 27201=>guess that it was  hands, because the riddle then becomes easier,  and  also 
line 27202=>because, as I read the marks, he was carried to this point by  an Orc. Blood 
line 27203=>
line 27204=>####-was spilled  there,  a few paces away, orc-blood. There  are  deep prints of 
line 27205=>hoofs  all about this  spot, and signs that a heavy thing was  dragged away. 
line 27206=>The Orc  was slain by horsemen, and later  his body  was hauled to the fire. 
line 27207=>But the hobbit  was not seen: he was not "in the open", for it was night and 
line 27208=>he still had his elven-cloak. He was exhausted and  hungry, and it is not to 
line 27209=>be wondered at  that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen 
line 27210=>enemy, he rested and ate a little  before he crept away. But it is a comfort 
line 27211=>to  know  that he had some lembas in  his  pocket, even though  he  ran away 
line 27212=>without gear  or pack;  that, perhaps, is  like a hobbit. I say he, though I 
line 27213=>hope and guess  that both  Merry and  Pippin were  here together. There  is, 
line 27214=>however, nothing to show that for certain.' 
line 27215=>     'And how do you suppose that either of  our friends came to have a hand 
line 27216=>free?' asked Gimli. 
line 27217=>     'I do  not know how it happened,' answered Aragorn. 'Nor  do I know why 
line 27218=>an Orc was carrying them  away. Not  to help  them to escape, we may be sure. 
line 27219=>Nay, rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled 
line 27220=>me  from  the beginning: why when  Boromir had fallen  were the Orcs content 
line 27221=>with the capture  of Merry and Pippin? They did not seek out  the rest of us,  
line 27222=>nor attack our camp;  but instead they went with all speed towards Isengard.  
line 27223=>Did they suppose they had captured the Ring-bearer and his faithful comrade?  
line 27224=>I think not. Their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to Orcs,  
line 27225=>even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of 
line 27226=>the  Ring: they  are not trusty servants. But  I  think  the  Orcs had  been 
line 27227=>commanded  to capture hobbits, alive, at all costs.  An attempt was made  to 
line 27228=>slip out with the precious prisoners  before the  battle. Treachery perhaps, 
line 27229=>likely  enough with such folk; some large and bold Orc may have  been trying 
line 27230=>to  escape with the  prize  alone, for his own ends. There, that is my tale. 
line 27231=>Others might  be devised. But on this we may count in any case: one at least  
line 27232=>of our  friends escaped. It is our task to find him and help  him  before we 
line 27233=>return to Rohan.  We  must not  be  daunted by Fangorn, since need drove him 
line 27234=>into that dark place.' 
line 27235=>     'I  do  not  know  which daunts me more: Fangorn, or the thought of the 
line 27236=>long road through Rohan on foot,' said Gimli. 
line 27237=>     'Then let us go to the forest,' said Aragorn. 
line 27238=>     It was  not  long before Aragorn found fresh signs. At one point,  near 
line 27239=>the bank  of the Entwash, he came upon  footprints:  hobbit-prints, but  too 
line 27240=>light for  much to  be made of  them. Then again beneath the bole of a great 
line 27241=>
line 27242=>####-tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. The earth was 
line 27243=>bare and dry, and did not reveal much. 
line 27244=>     'One hobbit at least stood  here for a while and looked  back; and then 
line 27245=>he turned away into the forest,' said Aragorn. 
line 27246=>     'Then we must go  in, too,' said Gimli. 'But I do not like the look  of 
line 27247=>this Fangorn: and  we  were  warned  against  it. I  wish the chase had  led 
line 27248=>anywhere else!' 
line 27249=>     'I do  not think  the wood feels evil,  whatever  tales  may say,' said 
line 27250=>Legolas. He stood under the  eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he 
line 27251=>were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. 'No, it is  not 
line 27252=>evil; or what evil is in it is far away. I catch only the faintest echoes of 
line 27253=>dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. There is no malice near 
line 27254=>us; but there is watchfulness, and anger.' 
line 27255=>     'Well, it has no cause to be angry with me,'  said Gimli.  'I have done 
line 27256=>it no harm. ' 
line 27257=>     'That is just as well,' said Legolas. 'But nonetheless it has  suffered 
line 27258=>harm. There  is something  happening inside, or  going to happen. Do you not 
line 27259=>feel the tenseness? It takes my breath.' 
line 27260=>     'I feel  the air is stuffy,' said the Dwarf. 'This wood is lighter than 
line 27261=>Mirkwood, but it is musty and shabby.' 
line 27262=>     'It is old, very old,' said the Elf. 'So old that almost  I  feel young 
line 27263=>again, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you children. It is old and 
line 27264=>full of memory. I  could have been happy  here,  if  I  had come in days  of 
line 27265=>peace.' 
line 27266=>     'I dare say  you could,'  snorted Gimli. 'You are a  Wood-elf,  anyway, 
line 27267=>though Elves of any kind are strange folk. Yet you comfort me. Where you go, 
line 27268=>I will go. But keep your bow ready to  hand, and I will keep my axe loose in 
line 27269=>my belt. Not  for  use on trees,' he  added hastily, looking  up at the tree 
line 27270=>under which they  stood.  'I do not  wish to meet that  old  man at unawares 
line 27271=>without an argument ready to hand, that is all. Let us go!' 
line 27272=>     With that the three hunters plunged into the forest of Fangorn. Legolas 
line 27273=>and Gimli left the tracking to Aragorn. There was little for him to see. The 
line 27274=>floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing 
line 27275=>that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned oft en to the banks 
line 27276=>of the stream.  So it was that he came upon the place where Merry and Pippin 
line 27277=>had  drunk  and  bathed  their  feet.  There plain for all  to see were  the 
line 27278=>footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other. 
line 27279=>
line 27280=>####-     'This is good tidings,' said Aragorn. 'Yet  the marks are  two days old 
line 27281=>And it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water -side.' 
line 27282=>     'Then what shall we do now?' said Gimli. 'We cannot pursue them through 
line 27283=>the whole fastness of Fangorn. We have come ill supplied. If we do  not find  
line 27284=>them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and 
line 27285=>show our friendship by starving together.' 
line 27286=>     'If that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,'  said Aragorn. 
line 27287=>'Let us go on.' 
line 27288=>     They  came at  length  to the steep abrupt  end of Treebeard's Hill and 
line 27289=>looked  up at the rock -wall with its rough  steps leading to the high shelf.  
line 27290=>Gleams of sun were  striking through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now 
line 27291=>looked less grey and drear. 
line 27292=>     'Let  us go up a nd look about us!' said Legolas. 'I will feel my breath 
line 27293=>short. I should like to taste a freer air for a while.' 
line 27294=>     The  companions climbed  up. Aragorn came last,  moving slowly: he  was 
line 27295=>scanning the steps and ledges closely. 
line 27296=>     'I am almost sure that the  hobbits  have been up here,'  he said. 'But 
line 27297=>there  are  other marks,  very strange marks,  which  I do not understand. I 
line 27298=>wonder if  we can see anything from this ledge which  will help us to  guess 
line 27299=>which way they went next?' 
line 27300=>     He  stood up and looked about,  but he saw nothing that was of any use. 
line 27301=>The shelf  faced southward  and  eastward; but only on the east was the view 
line 27302=>open. There he could see the heads  of the trees descending in ranks towards 
line 27303=>the plain from which they had come. 
line 27304=>     'We have journeyed a long way round,' said Legolas.  'We could have all 
line 27305=>come here safe together, if  we had left  the  Great River  on the second or  
line 27306=>third day and  struck  west.  Few  can foresee whither their road  will lead 
line 27307=>them, till they come to its end.' 
line 27308=>     'But we did not wish to come to Fangorn,' said Gimli. 
line 27309=>     'Yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,' said Legolas. 'Look!' 
line 27310=>     'Look at what?' said Gimli. 
line 27311=>     'There in the trees.' 
line 27312=>     'Where? I have not elf-eyes.' 
line 27313=>     'Hush! Speak more softly! Look!'  said Legolas  pointing. 'Down in  the 
line 27314=>wood, back in the Way  that we have just come. It is he. Cannot you see him, 
line 27315=>passing from tree to tree?' 
line 27316=>     'I  see, I see  now!' hissed Gimli. 'Look, Aragorn! Did I not warn you? 
line 27317=>
line 27318=>####-There is the old man.  All in dirty  grey  rags: that is why I could not see 
line 27319=>him at first.' 
line 27320=>     Aragorn  looked and beheld a  bent figure moving slowly. It was not far 
line 27321=>away. It looked like  an old beggar-man, walking wearily, leaning on a rough 
line 27322=>staff. His head was bowed,  and he did not look towards them. In other lands 
line 27323=>they would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each 
line 27324=>feeling a strange expectancy: something was  approaching that  held a hidden 
line 27325=>power -or menace. 
line 27326=>     Gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure drew 
line 27327=>nearer. Then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he burst out: 'Your  
line 27328=>bow,  Legolas! Bend  it!  Get ready! It is Saruman. Do not let him speak, or 
line 27329=>put a spell upon us! Shoot first!' 
line 27330=>     Legolas  took  his  bow and bent  it, slowly  and  as if some other will 
line 27331=>resisted him. He held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the 
line 27332=>string. Aragorn stood silent, his face was watchful and intent. 
line 27333=>     'Why are  you waiting? What is the  matter with  you?' said Gimli in  a  
line 27334=>hissing whisper. 
line 27335=>     'Legolas is right,' said Aragorn quietly. 'We may not  shoot an old man 
line 27336=>so, at unawares and unchallenged, whatever fear or doubt be on us. Watch and 
line 27337=>wait!' 
line 27338=>     At that moment the old man quickened  his pace and came with surprising 
line 27339=>speed to the  foot of the  rock -wall. Then suddenly he looked up, while they  
line 27340=>stood motionless looking down. There was no sound. 
line 27341=>     They  could not see his face: he was hooded, and above the hood he wore 
line 27342=>a wide-brimmed hat, so that all his  features were over -shadowed, except for  
line 27343=>the end  of his  nose and his grey beard. Yet it seemed  to  Aragorn that he 
line 27344=>caught the gleam  of  eyes keen and bright  from  within  the shadow  of the 
line 27345=>hooded brows.  
line 27346=>     At last the old man  broke the silence.  'Well met indeed , my friends,' 
line 27347=>he said  in  a soft  voice. 'I wish to  speak to you. Will  you come down or  
line 27348=>shall I come up?' Without waiting for an answer he began to climb. 
line 27349=>     'Now!' said Gimli. 'Stop him, Legolas!' 
line 27350=>     'Did I not say that I wished to speak to you?'  said the old man.  'Put 
line 27351=>away that bow, Master Elf!' 
line 27352=>     The bow  and arrow fell from Legolas' hands, and his arms hung loose at 
line 27353=>his sides. 
line 27354=>     'And you, Master Dwarf, pray  take your hand from your axe-haft, till I 
line 27355=>
line 27356=>####-am up! You will not need such arguments. ' 
line 27357=>     Gimli started and then stood still as stone, staring, while the old man 
line 27358=>sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a  goat. All weariness seemed to have 
line 27359=>left him. As he stepped up on to the shelf there was a  gleam, too brief for 
line 27360=>certainty, a quick glint  of  white, as if some garment shrouded by the grey 
line 27361=>rags had been for an instant revealed The intake  of Gimli's breath could be 
line 27362=>heard as a loud hiss in the silence. 
line 27363=>     'Well met, I say again!' said the old man, coming towards them. When he 
line 27364=>was a few feet away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with his head thrust  
line 27365=>forward, peering at them from under  his hood. 'And what may you be doing in 
line 27366=>these  parts? An Elf, a Man, and  a Dwarf. all  clad  in  elvish fashion. No 
line 27367=>doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all. Such things are not often 
line 27368=>seen here.' 
line 27369=>     'You speak as one that knows Fangorn well,' said Aragorn. 'Is that so?' 
line 27370=>     'Not well,' said  the  old man: 'that would be the study of many lives.  
line 27371=>But I come here now and again.' 
line 27372=>     'Might we know your name, and then hear what it is that you have to say 
line 27373=>to us?'  said Aragorn. 'The morning passes, and we have an errand  that will 
line 27374=>not wait.' 
line 27375=>     'As  for what I wished to say, I  have said it: What  may you be doing, 
line 27376=>and  what  tale can  you tell of yourselves? As for my name!'  He broke off,  
line 27377=>laughing  long  and  softly. Aragorn  felt a shudder run  through him at the 
line 27378=>sound, a  strange  cold  thrill; and yet  it was not  fear or terror that he 
line 27379=>felt: rather it was  like  the  sudden bite of a keen air,  or the slap of a  
line 27380=>cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper. 
line 27381=>     'My name!' said the  old  man again. 'Have you not guessed it  already?  
line 27382=>You have heard  it before, I  think. Yes, you have heard it before. But come 
line 27383=>now, what of your tale?' 
line 27384=>     The three companions stood silent and made no answer. 
line 27385=>     'There are some who would begin to doubt whether your  errand is fit to 
line 27386=>tell,' said the  old man. 'Happily I know something of it.  You are tracking 
line 27387=>the footsteps of two young hobbits, I believe. Yes, hobbits. Don't stare, as 
line 27388=>if you had  never heard the strange  name before. You have,  and so have  I. 
line 27389=>Well, they climbed up  here  the day before yesterday; and  they met someone 
line 27390=>that they did not expect. Does that comfort you? And  now  you would like to 
line 27391=>know where they were taken? Well, well, maybe I can give you some news 
line 27392=>about 
line 27393=>
line 27394=>####-that.  But why are we standing? Your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent  
line 27395=>as you thought. Let us sit down and be more at ease.' 
line 27396=>     The old man turned away  and went  towards a heap of fallen stones  and 
line 27397=>rock at the  foot of the cliff  behind. Immediately, as  if a spell had been 
line 27398=>removed, the others relaxed and  stirred. Gimli's  hand  went at once to his 
line 27399=>axe-haft. Aragorn drew his sword. Legolas picked up his bow. 
line 27400=>     The old man took no notice,  but stooped and sat himself on  a low flat 
line 27401=>stone. Then  his grey cloak  drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he 
line 27402=>was clothed beneath all in white. 
line 27403=>     'Saruman!' cried Gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand. 'speak! 
line 27404=>Tell  us where you have  hidden  our friends! What  have you done with them?  
line 27405=>Speak, or  I will  make a dint in your hat that even  a wizard will find  it 
line 27406=>hard to deal with!' 
line 27407=>     The old  man was too quick for him. He sprang to his feet and leaped to 
line 27408=>the top of a large rock. There he stood, grown suddenly tall, towering above 
line 27409=>them. His hood and his grey rags were flung away. His  white garments shone. 
line 27410=>He  lifted up  his staff, and  Gimli's axe leaped from his  grasp  and  fell 
line 27411=>ringing on the ground. The sword of Aragorn,  stiff in his motionless  hand, 
line 27412=>blazed with a sudden fire. Legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high  
line 27413=>into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame. 
line 27414=>     'Mithrandir!' he cried. 'Mithrandir!' 
line 27415=>     'Well met, I say to you again. Legolas!' said the old man. 
line 27416=>     They all gazed at him. His hair was white as snow in  the sunshine; and 
line 27417=>gleaming  white  was his robe;  the eyes under  his deep  brows were bright,  
line 27418=>piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. Between wonder, joy,  
line 27419=>and fear they stood and found no words to say. 
line 27420=>     At  last  Aragorn stirred.  'Gandalf!'  he said.  'Beyond all hope  you  
line 27421=>return to us in our  need! What veil was over my sight? Gandalf!' Gimli said  
line 27422=>nothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes.  
line 27423=>     'Gandalf,' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long 
line 27424=>disused word. 'Yes, that was the name. I was Gandalf.' 
line 27425=>     He stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it  
line 27426=>about him: it seemed as if  the  sun had been  shining, but now was  hid  in 
line 27427=>cloud again.  'Yes, you may  still call me Gandalf,'  he said, and the voice 
line 27428=>was the  voice  of their old friend  and guide. 'Get  up, my  good Gimli! No 
line 27429=>blame to  you, and no harm done to  me. Indeed my friends,  none of you have 
line 27430=>any weapon that could  hurt me. Be merry! We meet  again. At the turn of the 
line 27431=>
line 27432=>####-tide. The great storm is coming, but the tide has turned.' 
line 27433=>     He laid  his hand on  Gimli's head, and the Dwarf looked up and laughed 
line 27434=>suddenly. 'Gandalf!' he said. 'But you are all in white!' 
line 27435=>     'Yes, I am white  now,' said Gandalf.  'Indeed I am  Saruman, one might 
line 27436=>almost  say,  Saruman  as  he  should have  been. But come  now, tell me  of 
line 27437=>yourselves! I  have passed through fire and  deep water,  since we parted. I 
line 27438=>have forgotten much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had 
line 27439=>forgotten. I can see  many things far off, but many things that are close at 
line 27440=>hand I cannot see. Tell me of yourselves!' 
line 27441=>     'What do  you wish to know?' said Aragorn. 'All that has happened since 
line 27442=>we parted on  the bridge would be a long tale.  Will you  not first give  us 
line 27443=>news of the hobbits? Did you find them, and are they safe?' 
line 27444=>     'No, I did not find them,' said Gandalf. 'There was a darkness over the 
line 27445=>valleys of the  Emyn Muil, and I did not know  of their captivity, until the 
line 27446=>eagle told me.' 
line 27447=>     'The eagle!' said  Legolas. 'I have seen an eagle high and far off: the 
line 27448=>last time was three days ago, above the Emyn Muil.' 
line 27449=>     'Yes,'  said Gandalf,  'that  was Gwaihir the Windlord,  who rescued me 
line 27450=>from Orthanc.  I sent him before me to watch the River and  gather  tidings. 
line 27451=>His sight is keen, but he cannot see all  that passes under hill  and  tree. 
line 27452=>Some things he has  seen, and  others I  have seen myself.  The Ring now has 
line 27453=>passed beyond my help, or  the help of any of  the Company that set out from 
line 27454=>Rivendell. Very nearly it was revealed to  the Enemy, but it escaped.  I had 
line 27455=>some part in that: for I sat  in a  high place, and I strove  with the  Dark 
line 27456=>Tower; and  the Shadow passed. Then  I  was weary, very weary; and I  walked 
line 27457=>long in dark thought.' 
line 27458=>     'Then you know about Frodo!' said Gimli. 'How do things go with him?' 
line 27459=>     'I cannot say. He was saved from a great peril, but many lie before him 
line 27460=>still. He resolved to go alone to Mordor, and he set out: that is all that I 
line 27461=>can say.' 
line 27462=>     'Not alone,' said Legolas. 'We think that Sam went with him.' 
line 27463=>     'Did he!' said Gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on 
line 27464=>his face. 'Did  he indeed? It is news to  me, yet  it does not  surprise me. 
line 27465=>Good! Very good! You lighten  my heart. You must tell me more. Now sit by 
line 27466=>me 
line 27467=>and tell me the tale of your journey.' 
line 27468=>     The companions  sat on the ground at his  feet, and Aragorn took up the 
line 27469=>
line 27470=>####-tale. For a long  while Gandalf said nothing, and he asked no quest ions. His 
line 27471=>hands were  spread upon his knees, and his eyes  were closed. At  last  when 
line 27472=>Aragorn spoke of the death of Boromir and of his last journey upon the Great 
line 27473=>River, the old man sighed. 
line 27474=>     'You have not said  all  that you know or guess, Aragorn my  friend,' he 
line 27475=>said quietly. 'Poor Boromir! I could not see what happened to him. It was  a  
line 27476=>sore trial  for such a man: a warrior, and a  lord of men. Galadriel told me 
line 27477=>that he was in peril. But  he escaped in the end.  I am glad. It was  not in 
line 27478=>vain that  the  young hobbits  came with us, if only for Boromir's sake. But 
line 27479=>that is not the  only part they have to play. They were brought  to Fangorn, 
line 27480=>and  their coming  was like  the  falling  of  small stones  that starts  an 
line 27481=>avalanche  in  the  mountains. Even  a s  we talk  here,  I  hear  the  first 
line 27482=>rumblings. Saruman  had  best  not be caught  away  from  home  when the dam 
line 27483=>bursts!' 
line 27484=>     'In one thing you  have not changed, dear friend,' said  Aragorn:  'you  
line 27485=>still speak in riddles.' 
line 27486=>     'What?  In riddles?'  sa id  Gandalf. 'No!  For I was talking  aloud  to 
line 27487=>myself. A habit of the old: they choose  the wisest  person present to speak 
line 27488=>to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.' He laughed, but 
line 27489=>the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine. 
line 27490=>     'I am  no longer  young even  in the  reckoning of  Men of the  Ancient 
line 27491=>Houses,' said Aragorn. 'Will you not open your mind more clearly to me?' 
line 27492=>     'What  then shall  I say?'  said Gandalf, and  paused  for a  while  in 
line 27493=>thought. 'This in brief is how  I  see things at the moment, if you wish  to 
line 27494=>have a piece of my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of course, has long 
line 27495=>known that the Ring  is abroad, and that it is  borne by a  hobbit. He knows 
line 27496=>now the number  of our  Company that set out fr om Rivendell, and the kind of 
line 27497=>each of us.  But he does  not yet  perceive our purpose clearly. He supposes 
line 27498=>that we were all going  to Minas Tirith; for that is what he  would  himself 
line 27499=>have done in our  place. And according to  his wisdom  it would have  been a 
line 27500=>heavy stroke against his power. Indeed he is in great fear, not knowing what 
line 27501=>mighty  one  may suddenly  appear, wielding the Ring, and assailing him with 
line 27502=>war, seeking to cast him  down and take his  place. That we  should wish  to 
line 27503=>cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that  occurs  to 
line 27504=>his  mind. That we should try to destroy the Ring itself has not yet entered 
line 27505=>into his darkest dream. In which no doubt you will see our good fortune  and  
line 27506=>our hope. For imagining war he has let loose war,  believing  that he has no 
line 27507=>
line 27508=>####-time to  waste; for he  that  strikes the  first blow, if he strikes it hard 
line 27509=>enough, may need  to strike no  more.  So the forces that he has  long  been 
line 27510=>preparing he is now  setting in motion, sooner than he intended.  Wise  fool. 
line 27511=>For if he had used all his power to guard Mordor,  so that none could enter, 
line 27512=>and bent  all his guild  to the hunting of the  Ring, then indeed hope would 
line 27513=>have faded: neither  Ring nor Bearer could long have eluded him. But now his 
line 27514=>eye gazes abroad rather than near at home; and mostly he looks towards Minas 
line 27515=>Tirith. Very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm. 
line 27516=>     'For  already he knows that the messengers that  he  sent to waylay the 
line 27517=>Company have  failed again. They have not  found the Ring. Neither have they 
line 27518=>brought away any hobbits as hostages. Had they done even so much as that, it 
line 27519=>would have been a heavy blow to us, and it might have been fatal. But let us 
line 27520=>not darken  our hearts by imagining the trial of their gentle loyalty in the 
line 27521=>Dark Tower. For the Enemy has failed-so far. Thanks to Saruman:' 
line 27522=>     'Then is not Saruman a traitor?' said Gimli. 
line 27523=>     'Indeed yes,' said Gandalf.  'Doubly. And is  not that strange? Nothing 
line 27524=>that  we have endured of  late has seemed  so grievous  as  the  treason  of 
line 27525=>Isengard. Even reckoned as a lord and captain Saruman has grown very strong. 
line 27526=>He threatens the Men of  Rohan and draws  off their help from Minas  Tirith, 
line 27527=>even as the main blow is approaching from the East. Yet a treacherous weapon 
line 27528=>is ever a danger to the hand.  Saruman also had a mind to capture  the Ring, 
line 27529=>for  himself,  or  at least to snare  some hobbits for his evil purposes. So 
line 27530=>between them our enemies have contrived only to  bring Merry and Pippin with 
line 27531=>marvellous speed, and in the  nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they  
line 27532=>would never have come at all! 
line 27533=>     'Also they have  filled  themselves with new doubts that  disturb their 
line 27534=>plans. No tidings of  the battle will come to Mordor, thanks to the horsemen  
line 27535=>of Rohan;  but the Dark Lord knows that two hobbits were  taken in the  Emyn 
line 27536=>Muil  and borne away  towards Isengard against the will of his own servants. 
line 27537=>He now has Isengard to fear as  well as Minas Tirith. If Minas Tirith falls,  
line 27538=>it will go ill with Saruman.' 
line 27539=>     'It is a pity that our  friends lie in between,' said Gimli. 'If no land 
line 27540=>divided Isengard  and Mordor, then  they could  fight  while we watched  and 
line 27541=>waited.' 
line 27542=>     'The victor would emerge  stronger  than either, and  free from doubt,' 
line 27543=>said  Gandalf.  'But  Isengard  cannot  figh t  Mordor,  unless Saruman first  
line 27544=>obtains the Ring. That he will never do now. He does not yet know his peril. 
line 27545=>
line 27546=>####-There is much that he does not know. He was so eager to lay his hands on his 
line 27547=>prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on  
line 27548=>his messengers. But he came too late, for once,  and the battle was over and 
line 27549=>beyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not  remain here long.  
line 27550=>I  look into  his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes 
line 27551=>that the horsemen slew and burned all  upon the field of battle; but he does 
line 27552=>not know whether  the Orcs were bringing any  prisoners or not. And  he does 
line 27553=>not know of  the  quarrel between his  servants and the Orcs  of Mordor; nor  
line 27554=>does he know of the Winged Messenger.' 
line 27555=>     'The Winged  Messenger!' cried  Legolas. 'I shot at him with the bow of 
line 27556=>Galadriel above Sarn Gebir, and I felled  him from the sky. He filled us all 
line 27557=>with fear. What new terror is this?' 
line 27558=>     'One that you cannot slay with arrows,'  said  Gandalf. 'You on ly  slew 
line 27559=>his steed.  It was a good deed; but the Rider was soon horsed again.  For he 
line 27560=>was a Nazgyl, one of  the Nine, who ride now upon winged  steeds. Soon their 
line 27561=>terror will overshadow the last armies of  our friends, cutting off the sun. 
line 27562=>But they have not yet been allowed to cross the River, and  Saruman does not 
line 27563=>know of this new shape  in which the Ringwraiths have been clad. His thought 
line 27564=>is ever on  the Ring.  Was  it  present in the battle? Was it found? What if 
line 27565=>Thjoden, Lord of the Mark, should come by  it and learn of its power? That is 
line 27566=>the danger that he  sees,  and  he  has fled  back to Isengard to double and 
line 27567=>treble his assault on Rohan. And all the time there is another danger, close 
line 27568=>at  hand,  which  he does  not  see, busy  with his fiery  thoughts. He  has 
line 27569=>forgotten Treebeard.' 
line 27570=>     'Now  you  speak  to  yourself  again,'  said  Aragorn  with  a  smile. 
line 27571=>'Treebeard is not known to me. And I have guessed part of  Saruman's  double 
line 27572=>treachery; yet I do not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to Fangorn 
line 27573=>has served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.' 
line 27574=>     'Wait a minute!'  cried Gimli. 'There  is another  thing that  I should 
line 27575=>like to know first. Was it you, Gandalf, or Saruman that we saw last night?' 
line 27576=>     'You  certainly did  not see me, '  answered Gandalf,  'therefore I must  
line 27577=>guess that you saw Saruman. Evidently we look so much alike that your desire 
line 27578=>to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.' 
line 27579=>     'Good, good!' said Gimli. 'I am glad that it was not you.' 
line 27580=>     Gandalf laughed again. 'Yes, my good Dwarf,' he said, 'it is a  comfort 
line 27581=>not to  be mistaken at all  points. Do I not know  it only too well! But, of 
line 27582=>course, I  never blamed you for your welcome of me. How  could I  do so, who 
line 27583=>
line 27584=>####-have so  often  counselled  my friends to suspect even their  own hands when 
line 27585=>dealing  with  the Enemy. Bless you, Gimli, son of Gluin! Maybe you will see 
line 27586=>us both together one day and judge between us!' 
line 27587=>     'But  the hobbits!' Legolas broke in. 'We have  come far to seek  them, 
line 27588=>and you seem to know where they are. Where are they now?' 
line 27589=>     'With Treebeard and the Ents,' said Gandalf.  
line 27590=>     'The Ents!' exclaimed  Aragorn. 'Then there is truth in the old legends 
line 27591=>about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees?  
line 27592=>Are  there  still  Ents in the  world? I thought they were  only a memory of 
line 27593=>ancient days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of Rohan.' 
line 27594=>     'A legend  of Rohan!' cried  Legolas. 'Nay, every Elf in Wilderland has 
line 27595=>sung songs of the old Onodrim and their long sorrow. Yet even among us  they 
line 27596=>are only a memory. If I were to meet one  still walking in this  world, then 
line 27597=>indeed I should feel young again! But Treebeard: that is only a rendering of 
line 27598=>Fangorn into the Common Speech; yet you seem  to  speak of a  person. Who is 
line 27599=>this Treebeard?' 
line 27600=>     'Ah! now you are asking much,' said Gandalf. 'The little that I know of 
line 27601=>his long  slow  story would  make  a  tale for which we  have no  time  now.  
line 27602=>Treebeard  is Fangorn, the  guardian of the  forest; he is the oldest of the 
line 27603=>Ents, the oldest living thing that still  walks  beneath the Sun  upon  this 
line 27604=>Middle-earth. I  hope indeed,  Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and 
line 27605=>Pippin have been fortunate: they  met  him here, even where  we sit. For  he  
line 27606=>came here  two days ago  and bore  them away to his  dwelling far off by the  
line 27607=>roots of the  mountains. He often  comes here, especially  when  his mind is 
line 27608=>uneasy, and rumours of  the world outside trouble him. I  saw him  four days 
line 27609=>ago striding among the trees, and  I  think he saw me, for he  paused; but I 
line 27610=>did not  speak,  for I was heavy with  thought, and  weary after my struggle 
line 27611=>with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.' 
line 27612=>     'Perhaps  he also thought that you were  Saruman,' said Gimli. 'But you  
line 27613=>speak of  him as if he was a friend. I thought Fangorn was dangerous.' 
line 27614=>     'Dangerous!'  cried  Gandalf.  'And  so  am  I,  very  dangerous:  more 
line 27615=>dangerous than anything you  will  ever meet,  unless you are  brought alive 
line 27616=>before  the seat of the Dark Lord. And Aragorn is dangerous, and Legolas  is 
line 27617=>dangerous. You  are  beset with  dangers,  Gimli  son  of Gluin; for you are 
line 27618=>dangerous yourself,  in your own fashion. Certainly the forest of Fangorn is 
line 27619=>perilous-not  least to those that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn 
line 27620=>himself, he  is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. But now 
line 27621=>
line 27622=>####-his long slow wrath is brimming over, and all the forest is filled  with it. 
line 27623=>The coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: 
line 27624=>it will soon be running like a flood; but its tide is turned against Saruman 
line 27625=>and the axes of Isengard.  A thing is about to happen which has not happened 
line 27626=>since the Elder  Days: the Ents are going to wake up and find that they  are 
line 27627=>strong.' 
line 27628=>     'What will they do?' asked Legolas in astonishment. 
line 27629=>     'I do not know,' said Gandalf. 'I do not think  they know themselves. I 
line 27630=>wonder.' He fell silent, his head bowed in thought. 
line 27631=>     The  others looked  at him. A gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell 
line 27632=>on his hands, which lay now  upturned on his  lap: they seemed to  be filled 
line 27633=>with light as  a  cup is with water. At last he looked up and gazed straight 
line 27634=>at the sun. 
line 27635=>     'The morning is wearing away,' he said. 'Soon we must go.' 
line 27636=>     'Do we go to find our friends and to see Treebeard?' asked Aragorn. 
line 27637=>     'No,' said Gandalf. 'That is not  the road that  you must take. I  have 
line 27638=>spoken words of hope. But only of hope. Hope is not victory. War is 
line 27639=>     upon us and all  our friends, a war in which only the use  of  the Ring 
line 27640=>could give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow and great 
line 27641=>     fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am Gandalf, 
line 27642=>     Gandalf the White, but Black is mightier still.' 
line 27643=>     He rose and gazed out  eastward, shading his eyes, as if he  saw things 
line 27644=>far away that none of them could see. Then he shook his head. 'No,' he  said 
line 27645=>in  a soft voice, 'it has gone beyond our reach. Of that at least let  us be 
line 27646=>glad. We can no longer be tempted to use the Ring. We must go down to face a  
line 27647=>peril near despair, yet that deadly peril is removed.' 
line 27648=>     He turned. 'Come, Aragorn son of  Arathorn!'  he said. 'Do  not  regret 
line 27649=>your choice in the valley of the Emyn Muil,  nor call it a vain pursuit. You  
line 27650=>chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the  choice  was just,  and it 
line 27651=>has  been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met 
line 27652=>too late. But the quest  of  your companions is over. Your  next  journey is 
line 27653=>marked by your given word. You must go to Edoras and seek out Thjoden in 
line 27654=>his 
line 27655=>hall. For you are needed. The  light of And®ril must now be uncovered in the 
line 27656=>battle for  which it has so long waited. There is  war in  Rohan,  and worse 
line 27657=>evil: it goes ill with Thjoden.' 
line 27658=>     'Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?' said Legolas. 
line 27659=>
line 27660=>####-     'I  did not say so,' said Gandalf. 'Who knows?  Have patience. Go where 
line 27661=>you must go, and hope! To Edoras! I go thither also.' 
line 27662=>     'It is a long  way for  a man to walk, young or old,'  said Aragorn. 'I 
line 27663=>fear the battle will be over long ere I come there. ' 
line 27664=>     'We shall  see,  we  shall see,' said  Gandalf. 'Will you come now with 
line 27665=>me?' 
line 27666=>     'Yes, we will set out together,' said Aragorn. 'But I do not doubt that 
line 27667=>you  will  come  there before me, if you wish.' He rose and  looked  long at 
line 27668=>Gandalf. The others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing  one 
line 27669=>another. The grey figure of the Man, Aragorn son of Arathorn,  was tall, and 
line 27670=>stern as stone, his hand upon the hilt of his sword; he  looked  as  if some 
line 27671=>king out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the  shores of lesser men. 
line 27672=>Before him stooped the old figure, white; shining now as if with some  light  
line 27673=>kindled within,  bent, laden  with  years,  but holding a  power beyond  the 
line 27674=>strength of kings.  
line 27675=>     'Do I not say truly, Gandalf,' said Aragorn at last, 'that you could go 
line 27676=>whithersoever you wished quicker  than  I?  And this I also say: you are our 
line 27677=>captain and our banner.  The Dark Lord  has Nine. But we have One,  mightier  
line 27678=>than  they: the White Rider. He  has passed through the fire and  the abyss, 
line 27679=>and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.' 
line 27680=>     'Yes, together we will  follow you,' said Legolas. 'But first, it would 
line 27681=>ease my heart, Gandalf, to hear what befell you  in Moria. Will you not tell 
line 27682=>us? Can you not stay even to tell your friends how you were delivered?' 
line 27683=>     'I have stayed already too long,' answered Gandalf. 'Time is short. But 
line 27684=>if there were a year to spend, I would not tell you all.' 
line 27685=>     'Then  tell  us what  you will, and  time allows!'  said  Gimli. 'Come, 
line 27686=>Gandalf, tell us how you fared with the Balrog!' 
line 27687=>     'Name him  not!' said Gandalf,  and for a moment it seemed that a cloud 
line 27688=>of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death. 'Long 
line 27689=>time I fell,' he said at last, slowly, as if thinking back with  diffi culty. 
line 27690=>'Long I fell, and he fell with me. His fire was about me. I was burned. Then 
line 27691=>we plunged into the deep water and all was  dark. Cold it was as the tide of 
line 27692=>death: almost it froze my heart.' 
line 27693=>     'Deep  is the abyss  that is spanned by Durin's  Bridge, and  none  has 
line 27694=>measured it,' said Gimli. 
line 27695=>     'Yet  it has  a  bottom, beyond  light  and  knowledge,'  said Gandalf. 
line 27696=>'Thither I came at last, to the  uttermost foundations of stone. He was with 
line 27697=>
line 27698=>####-me still.  His fire was  quenched, but now he was a thing of slime, stronger  
line 27699=>than a strangling snake. 
line 27700=>     'We fought far under the living earth, where time is  not counted. Ever  
line 27701=>he clutched  me,  and  ever I  hewed  him,  till at last he  fled into  dark 
line 27702=>tunnels. They were not made by Durin's  folk, Gimli  son of   Gluin. Far, far 
line 27703=>below the  deepest delving  of the Dwarves, the world is gnawed  by nameless 
line 27704=>things.  Even Sauron  knows them not. They  are  older  than  he. Now I have 
line 27705=>walked there, but I will bring no report to darken the light of day. In that 
line 27706=>despair my enemy was my only hope, and I pursued him, clutching at his heel. 
line 27707=>Thus he brought me back at last to the secret  ways of Khazad-dym: too  well 
line 27708=>he knew them all. Ever up now we went, until we came to the Endless Stair.' 
line 27709=>     'Long has that  been lost,' said  Gimli. 'Many have  said  that it  was 
line 27710=>never made save in legend, but others say that it was destroyed.' 
line 27711=>     'It  was made, and it had not been destroyed,'  said Gandalf. 'From the 
line 27712=>lowest dungeon to the highest peak  it climbed. ascending in unbroken spiral 
line 27713=>in many thousand steps, until it issued at last in  Durin's Tower  carved in 
line 27714=>the living rock of Zirak-zigil, the pinnacle of the Silvertine. 
line 27715=>     'There upon Celebdil was a lonely window in the snow, and before it lay 
line 27716=>a  narrow space, a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world.  The  sun shone 
line 27717=>fiercely there, but all below was wrapped in cloud.  Out he sprang, and even 
line 27718=>as I came behind, he burst into new flame. There was none to see, or perhaps 
line 27719=>in after ages songs would still be sung of the Battle of the Peak.' Suddenly 
line 27720=>Gandalf laughed. 'But what would they say in song? Those that looked up from 
line 27721=>afar thought that  the  mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, 
line 27722=>and lightning, they said, smote upon  Celebdil,  and leaped back broken into 
line 27723=>tongues of fire. Is not that enough? A great smoke rose about us, vapour and 
line 27724=>steam. Ice fell like  rain. I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high 
line 27725=>place  and broke the  mountain-side  where  he  smote it  in his ruin.  Then 
line 27726=>darkness took me; and I strayed out  of thought and time, and I wandered far  
line 27727=>on roads that I will not tell. 
line 27728=>     'Naked I was sent back -- for a brief time, until my task  is done. And 
line 27729=>naked I lay upon  the mountain-top. The tower behind was crumbled into dust, 
line 27730=>the window gone; the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone. I 
line 27731=>was alone, forgotten, without escape upon the hard horn  of the world. There 
line 27732=>I lay staring upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each day was as long 
line 27733=>as a life-age of the earth. Faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all 
line 27734=>lands: the springing and the dying,  the song  and the weeping, and the slow 
line 27735=>
line 27736=>####-everlasting  groan  of  overburdened stone. And  so  at the last Gwaihir the 
line 27737=>Windlord found me again, and he took me up and bore me away. 
line 27738=>     ' 'Ever am I fated to be your burden, friend at need,' I said. 
line 27739=>     ' 'A burden  you have been,'  he answered, 'but not so  now. Light as a  
line 27740=>swan's feather in my claw you are. The Sun shines  through you. Indeed  I do 
line 27741=>not think you need me any more: were  I to let you fall you would float upon  
line 27742=>the wind.' 
line 27743=>     ' 'Do not let me fall!' I gasped, for I felt life in me again. 'Bear me 
line 27744=>to Lothlurien!' 
line 27745=>     ' 'That indeed is the command of the Lady Galadriel who sent me to look  
line 27746=>for you,' he answered. 
line 27747=>     'Thus  it was  that  I  came to Caras Galadhon and found you but lately 
line 27748=>gone. I tarried  there  in  the  ageless time of that  land where days bring 
line 27749=>healing  not  decay. Healing I found, and I was clothed  in white. Counsel I 
line 27750=>gave and counsel took. Thence by strange roads I came, and messages I  bring 
line 27751=>to some of you. To Aragorn I was bidden to say this:  
line 27752=>     Where now are the D®nedain, Elessar, Elessar? 
line 27753=>     Why do thy kinsfolk wander afar? 
line 27754=>     Near is the hour when the Lost should come forth, 
line 27755=>     And the Grey Company ride from the North. 
line 27756=>     But dark is the path appointed for thee: 
line 27757=>     The Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea. 
line 27758=>     To Legolas she sent this word: 
line 27759=>     Legolas Greenleaf long under tree 
line 27760=>     In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the Sea! 
line 27761=>     If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore, 
line 27762=>     Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.' 
line 27763=>     Gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes.  
line 27764=>     'Then she sent me no message?' said Gimli and bent his head. 
line 27765=>     'Dark are her words,'  said Legolas, 'and little  do they mean to those 
line 27766=>that receive them.' 
line 27767=>     'That is no comfort,' said Gimli. 
line 27768=>     'What then?' said Legolas. 'Would  you  have her speak openly to you of 
line 27769=>your death?' 
line 27770=>     'Yes. if she had nought else to say.' 
line 27771=>     'What  is that?' said Gandalf, opening his  eyes. 'Yes,  I think I  can 
line 27772=>guess  what her  words  may  mean.  Your pardon,  Gimli! I was pondering the 
line 27773=>
line 27774=>####-messages once again. But indeed she sent words to you, and  neither dark nor 
line 27775=>sad. 
line 27776=>     '  "To  Gimli son  of  Gluin," she  said,  "give  his   Lady's greeting. 
line 27777=>Lock -bearer, wherever thou goest  my thought goes with thee. But have a care 
line 27778=>to lay thine axe to the right tree!" ' 
line 27779=>     'In  happy hour  you  have returned to  us, Gandalf,'  cried the Dwarf,  
line 27780=>capering  as  he sang  loudly in the  strange dwarf-tongue. 'Come, come!' he 
line 27781=>shouted, swinging his axe. 'Since Gandalf's head is now sacred, let us  find  
line 27782=>one that it is right to cleave!' 
line 27783=>     'That  will  not  be far to seek,' said  Gandalf, rising from his seat. 
line 27784=>'Come!  We have  spent all  the time that is allowed to a meeting  of parted 
line 27785=>friends. Now there is need of haste.' 
line 27786=>     He wrapped himself again  in his old  tattered cloak, and led the  way. 
line 27787=>Following  him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way 
line 27788=>back through the forest, down the bank  of the Entwash. They  spoke no  more 
line 27789=>words,  until they stood again upon the grass  beyond the eaves of  Fangorn.  
line 27790=>There was no sign of their horses to be seen. 
line 27791=>     'They have not returned,' said Legolas. 'It will be a weary walk!' 
line 27792=>     'I shall not  walk. Time presses,' said  Gandalf.  Then lifting up  his 
line 27793=>head he gave  a long whistle. So clear and  piercing was  the  note that the 
line 27794=>others  stood  amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips. 
line 27795=>Three times he whistled; and then  faint and far off it seemed to  them that 
line 27796=>they heard the whinny  of a horse borne up from the plains upon the  eastern 
line 27797=>wind.  They waited wondering. Before long there came  the sound of hoofs, at 
line 27798=>first hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only to Aragorn as 
line 27799=>he lay upon the  grass, then  growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick  
line 27800=>beat. 
line 27801=>     'There is more than one horse coming,' said Aragorn. 
line 27802=>     'Certainly,' said Gandalf. 'We are too great a burden for one.' 
line 27803=>     'There are three,'  sa id Legolas, gazing out  over the plain.  'See how 
line 27804=>they run!  There is Hasufel, and  there is my  friend Arod  beside  him! But 
line 27805=>there is another that strides ahead: a very great horse. I have not seen his 
line 27806=>like before.' 
line 27807=>     'Nor will you again,' said Gandalf. 'That is Shadowfax. He is the chief 
line 27808=>of the  Mearas, lords  of horses, and not even Thjoden, King  of  Rohan, has 
line 27809=>ever looked on  a better. Does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly 
line 27810=>as a swift stream? He has come for me: the horse of the White  Rider. We are 
line 27811=>
line 27812=>####-going to battle together.' 
line 27813=>     Even  as the old wizard  spoke,  the great horse  came striding up  the 
line 27814=>slope towards them; his coat was glistening and his mane flowing in the wind 
line 27815=>of his speed. The two others followed, now  far behind. As soon as Shadowfax 
line 27816=>saw Gandalf, he checked his  pace and  whinnied loudly; then trotting gently  
line 27817=>forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the 
line 27818=>old man's neck. 
line 27819=>     Gandalf caressed him. 'It is a  long way from Rivendell, my friend,' he 
line 27820=>said;  'but you are wise and swift and  come at need.  Far let us  ride  now 
line 27821=>together, and part not in this world again!' 
line 27822=>     Soon  the other horses  came up  and stood quietly  by, as if  awaiting 
line 27823=>orders. 'We go at once to Meduseld, the  hall of your master, Thjoden,' said 
line 27824=>Gandalf, addressing them gravely. They bowed their heads.  'Time presses, so 
line 27825=>with your leave, my friends, we  will ride. We beg you to use  all the speed 
line 27826=>that  you can. Hasufel shall bear Aragorn and Arod Legolas. I will set Gimli  
line 27827=>before me, and by  his leave  Shadowfax shall bear us both. We will wait now 
line 27828=>only to drink a little.' 
line 27829=>     'Now I understand a part of last night's  riddle,' said Legolas  as  he 
line 27830=>sprang lightly  upon Arod's back.  'Whether they  fled  at first in fear, or 
line 27831=>not,  our horses met  Shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with  joy. 
line 27832=>Did you know that he was at hand, Gandalf?' 
line 27833=>     'Yes, I knew,'  said the wizard.  'I bent  my thought upon him, bidding 
line 27834=>him to  make haste; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land. 
line 27835=>Swiftly may he bear me back again!' 
line 27836=>     Gandalf spoke  now to Shadowfax, and  the horse set off at a good pace, 
line 27837=>yet  not  beyond the measure of the  others. After a little while  he turned 
line 27838=>suddenly, and  choosing  a place where the ba nks  were  lower, he waded  the 
line 27839=>river, and then led them away due south into a flat land, treeless and wide. 
line 27840=>The wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of  grass. There was 
line 27841=>no sign of road or track, but Shadowfax did not stay or falter. 
line 27842=>     'He is  steering a straight course now for  the halls of Thjoden  under  
line 27843=>the slopes of the White  Mountains,' said  Gandalf. 'It will be  quicker so. 
line 27844=>The ground is firmer in the Eastemnet, where the chief northward track lies,  
line 27845=>across the river, but Shadowfax knows the way through every fen and hollow.' 
line 27846=>     For many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands. Often the  
line 27847=>grass was so high  that it  reached above the knees of the riders, and their 
line 27848=>
line 27849=>####-steeds seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea. They came upon many 
line 27850=>hidden 
line 27851=>pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and  treacherous bogs;  but 
line 27852=>Shadowfax found the way, and the  other horses followed in his swath. Slowly 
line 27853=>the sun  fell from the sky down into the  West. Looking  out  over the great 
line 27854=>plain,  far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into 
line 27855=>the grass. Low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red 
line 27856=>upon either side. A smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun's disc to the 
line 27857=>hue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim 
line 27858=>of earth. 
line 27859=>     'There lies the Gap of Rohan,' said Gandalf. 'It is now almost due west  
line 27860=>of us. That way lies Isengard.' 
line 27861=>     'I see a great smoke,' said Legolas. 'What may that be?' 
line 27862=>     'Battle and war!' said  Gandalf. 'Ride on!' 
line 27863=> 
line 27864=>
line 27865=>####- 
line 27866=>
line 27867=>Chapter 6. The King of the Golden Hall 
line 27868=>
line 27869=> 
line 27870=> 
line 27871=>     They rode on  through sunset,  and slow dusk, and gathering night. When 
line 27872=>at last they  halted  and  dismounted,  even  Aragorn  was stiff and  weary. 
line 27873=>Gandalf only allowed  them a few  hou rs' rest. Legolas and  Gimli  slept and  
line 27874=>Aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but Gandalf stood, leaning on his 
line 27875=>staff, gazing  into the darkness, east and  west.  All was silent, and there 
line 27876=>was no sign or sound of living thing. The night was barred with long clouds,  
line 27877=>fleeting on a  chill wind, when  they  arose again. Under the cold moon they 
line 27878=>went on once more, as swift as by the light of day. 
line 27879=>     Hours passed and still they rode on. Gimli nodded and would have fallen 
line 27880=>from his seat, if Gandalf had not clutched and shaken him. Hasufel and Arod, 
line 27881=>weary but proud, followed their  tireless leader, a grey shadow before  them 
line 27882=>hardly to he seen. The miles went by. The waxing moon  sank into the  cloudy 
line 27883=>West. 
line 27884=>     A bitter chill came into the air. Slowly in the East the dark  faded to 
line 27885=>a  cold grey. Red  shafts of light leapt  above  the black walls of the Emyn 
line 27886=>Muil  far  away upon  their  left. Dawn came clear and bright; a wind  swept  
line 27887=>across  their path,  rushing through the  bent  grasses.  Suddenly Shadowfax 
line 27888=>stood still and neighed. Gandalf pointed ahead. 
line 27889=>     'Look!' he  cried, and  they lifted their tired eyes. Before them stood 
line 27890=>the mountains  of  the South:  white-tipped  and  streaked  with black.  The 
line 27891=>grass-lands  rolled against  the  hills  that clustered  at their feet,  and 
line 27892=>flowed up into many valleys still  dim and  dark, untouched  by the light of 
line 27893=>dawn,  winding  their way into the heart of the great mountains. Immediately 
line 27894=>before  the travellers the widest of these  glens  opened  like a  long gulf 
line 27895=>among the hills. Far inward they  glimpsed a tumbled mountain -mass with  one 
line 27896=>tall peak;  at the mouth of  the  vale there  stood  like  sentinel a lonely 
line 27897=>height. About its feet  there flowed, as a thread of silver, the stream that 
line 27898=>issued from the dale; upon its brow they caught, still  far away, a glint in 
line 27899=>the rising sun, a  glimmer of gold. 'Speak, Legolas!' said Gandalf. 'Tell us 
line 27900=>what you see there before us!' 
line 27901=>     Legolas  gazed  ahead, shading  his eyes from the  level shafts  of the 
line 27902=>new-risen  sun. 'I see a  white stream  that comes down from  the snows,' he  
line 27903=>said. 'Where it issues  from the shadow  of the vale a green hill rises upon 
line 27904=>
line 27905=>####-the east. A dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it. Within  there 
line 27906=>rise the  roofs of houses; and in the midst, set upon a green terrace, there 
line 27907=>stands  aloft  a  great  hall of Men. And it  seems to  my eyes  that it  is 
line 27908=>thatched with gold. The light  of it shines  far over the land. Golden, too, 
line 27909=>are the posts of its  doors. There men  in bright  mail stand; but all  else 
line 27910=>within the courts are yet asleep.' 
line 27911=>     'Edoras  those courts are called,' said Gandalf, 'and Meduseld  is that 
line 27912=>golden hall. There dwells Thjoden son of Thengel, King of the Mark of Rohan. 
line 27913=>We  are come  with the  rising  of  the day.  Now the road lies plain to see 
line 27914=>before us.  But  we  must  ride  more  warily; for  war  is abroad,  and the 
line 27915=>Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, do not sleep, even if it seem so from afar.  Draw 
line 27916=>no  weapon, speak no  haughty  word,  I  counsel you all, until we  are come 
line 27917=>before Thjoden's seat.' 
line 27918=>     The  morning was  bright and clear about them, and birds were  singing, 
line 27919=>when the  travellers came to the stream. It ran down swiftly into the plain, 
line 27920=>and beyond the feet  of  the hills  turned across their path in a wide bend, 
line 27921=>flowing away east to  feed the Entwash far off in  its reed-choked beds. The 
line 27922=>land was green: in the wet meads and along  the grassy borders of the stream 
line 27923=>grew many willow-trees. Already in this southern land they were blushing red 
line 27924=>at  their fingertips. Feeling  the approach of spring. Over the stream there 
line 27925=>was a ford  between low banks  much trampled by the  passage of horses.  The 
line 27926=>travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the 
line 27927=>uplands.  
line 27928=>     At the  foot of the  walled  hill the  way ran under the shadow of many 
line 27929=>mounds, high and green. Upon their western sides the grass was white as with 
line 27930=>a drifted snow: small flowers  sprang there like  countless stars  amid  the 
line 27931=>turf. 
line 27932=>     'Look!' said  Gandalf. 'How fair are  the  bright  eyes  in  the grass!  
line 27933=>Evermind they  are called,  simbelmynl in this land of Men, for they blossom 
line 27934=>in all the seasons of the year, and grow where dead men rest. Behold! we are 
line 27935=>come to the great barrows  where the sires of  Thjoden sleep.' 'Seven mounds 
line 27936=>upon the left,  and nine upon the right,' said Aragorn. 'Many long  lives of 
line 27937=>men it is since the golden hall was built.' 
line 27938=>     'Five hundred times  have the  red leaves fallen in Mirkwood in my home 
line 27939=>since then,' said Legolas, 'and but a little while does that seem to us.' 
line 27940=>     'But  to the Riders of  the Mark it  seems  so long ago,' said Aragorn, 
line 27941=>'that  the  raising of this  house  is but a memory of  song, and  the years 
line 27942=>
line 27943=>####-before are lost in the mist of time.  Now  they  call this land their  home, 
line 27944=>their own, and  their speech is sundered  from their northern  kin.' Then he 
line 27945=>began  to chant softly in a  slow tongue unknown to the  Elf  and Dwarf; yet  
line 27946=>they listened, for there was a strong music in it. 
line 27947=>     'That, I guess, is the language of the Rohirrim,' said Legolas; 'for it 
line 27948=>is like  to  this land itself; rich and rolling in part,  and else  hard and 
line 27949=>stern as the mountains.  But I cannot guess what it  means, save  that it is 
line 27950=>laden with the sadness of Mortal Men.' 
line 27951=>     'It runs thus  in  the Common Speech,' said Aragorn, 'as near as  I can 
line 27952=>make it. 
line 27953=>     Where now the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing?  
line 27954=>     Where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing? 
line 27955=>     Where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing? 
line 27956=>     Where is the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing? 
line 27957=>     They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;  
line 27958=>     The days have gone down in the West behind the hills into shadow.  
line 27959=>     Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning, 
line 27960=>     Or behold the flowing years from the Sea returning? 
line 27961=>     Thus spoke a  forgotten poet long ago in Rohan, recalling how tall  and 
line 27962=>fair  was Eorl the Young,  who rode  down out  of the  North; and there were 
line 27963=>wings upon the feet  of  his steed, Felaruf, father   of horses. So men still 
line 27964=>sing in the evening.' 
line 27965=>     With these words the travellers passed the silent mounds. Following the 
line 27966=>winding way  up the  green shoulders  of the hills, they came at last to the 
line 27967=>wide wind-swept walls and the gates of Edoras.  
line 27968=>     There sat many men in bright mail, who sprang at once to their feet and 
line 27969=>barred  the  way with spears.  'Stay, strangers here unknown!' they cried in 
line 27970=>the tongue  of  the  Riddermark,  demanding  the  names and  errand  of  the  
line 27971=>strangers. Wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness; and they looked 
line 27972=>darkly upon Gandalf.  
line 27973=>     'Well do I  understand your speech,' he answered  in the same language; 
line 27974=>'yet few strangers do so. Why then do you not speak in the Common Tongue, 
line 27975=>as 
line 27976=>is the custom in the West, if you wi sh to be answered?' 
line 27977=>     'It is the will of Thjoden King that  none should enter his gates, save 
line 27978=>those who know our tongue and are our friends,'  replied one of the  guards.  
line 27979=>'None are welcome here in days of war but our  own folk, and those that come 
line 27980=>
line 27981=>####-from Mundburg in the land of Gondor. Who are you that come heedless over 
line 27982=>the 
line 27983=>plain thus strangely clad, riding horses like to our own  horses? Long  have 
line 27984=>we kept  guard here,  and we  have watched you from afar. Never have we seen 
line 27985=>other riders so strange, nor any horse more proud than is  one of these that 
line 27986=>bear  you.  He is One  of the  Mearas, unless our eyes  are cheated  by some 
line 27987=>spell. Say, are you not a wizard,  some spy from Saruman, or phantoms of his 
line 27988=>craft? Speak now and be swift!' 
line 27989=>     'We are  no phantoms,' said Aragorn,  'nor do your  eyes  cheat you. For  
line 27990=>indeed these are your own horses  that  we ride, as  you  knew well are  you  
line 27991=>asked, I  guess. But seldom  does thief  ride  home to the  stable. Here are 
line 27992=>Hasufel and Arod, that Jomer,  the  Third Marsha l  of the Mark,  lent to us,  
line 27993=>only two  days ago. We bring them back now, even as we promised him. Has 
line 27994=>not 
line 27995=>Jomer then returned and given warning of our coming?' 
line 27996=>     A troubled look came  into the guard's eyes. 'Of Jomer I have naught to 
line 27997=>say,' he answered. 'If  what you tell me  is  truth,  then doubtless Thjoden 
line 27998=>will  have heard of it. Maybe your coming was not wholly unlooked-for. It is 
line 27999=>but two nights ago that Wormtongue came to us and  said that by  the will of  
line 28000=>Thjoden no stranger should pass these gates. ' 
line 28001=>     'Wormtongue?' said Gandalf, looking sharply at the guard. 'Say no more!  
line 28002=>My errand is not to Wormtongue, but to the Lord of the Mark himself. I am in 
line 28003=>haste. Will you not go or send to say  that  we  are come?' His eyes glinted 
line 28004=>under his deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man. 
line 28005=>     'Yes,  I will go,' he answered  slowly. 'But what names shall I report?  
line 28006=>And what  shall I say of you? Old  and weary you seem now, and yet  you  are 
line 28007=>fell and grim beneath, I deem' 
line 28008=>     'Well do you see and speak,' said the wizard. 'For I am Gandalf. I have 
line 28009=>returned. And behold! I too bring back a horse. Here is Shadowfax the Great, 
line 28010=>whom no other hand can tame. And here beside me  is Aragorn son of 
line 28011=>Arathorn, 
line 28012=>the heir of Kings, and it is to Mundburg that he goes. Here also are Legolas 
line 28013=>the Elf and Gimli the  Dwarf, our  comrades. Go now and  say to your  master  
line 28014=>that we are at  his gates and  would have speech with him, if he will permit 
line 28015=>us to come into his hall.' 'Strange names you give indeed! But I will report 
line 28016=>them as you  bid and learn my master's will,' said  the  guard. 'Wait here a  
line 28017=>little  while, and f will bring you such answer as seems good to him. Do not 
line 28018=>
line 28019=>####-hope  too much!  These are dark  days.' He  went  swiftly away,  leaving the 
line 28020=>strangers  in the  watchful  keeping of his  comrades. After  some  time  he 
line 28021=>returned. 'Follow me!'  he said. 'Thjoden gives you leave  to enter; but any 
line 28022=>weapon that  you bear; be it only a  staff, you must leave on the threshold. 
line 28023=>The doorwardens will keep them.' 
line 28024=>     The dark gates were swung open. The travellers entered, walking in file 
line 28025=>behind their guide. They found  a broad path, paved  with hewn  stones,  now 
line 28026=>winding  upward,  now climbing in  short  flights of well-laid  steps.  Many 
line 28027=>houses  built of wood and many dark doors they passed.  Beside the  way in  a 
line 28028=>stone  channel a stream of clear water flowed,  sparkling and chattering. At  
line 28029=>length they came to the crown of the hill. There stood a high platform above 
line 28030=>a  green terrace,  at the foot of which a bright  spring gushed from a stone 
line 28031=>carved in the likeness of a  horse's  head;  beneath was  a  wide basin from 
line 28032=>which the  water. spilled and fed the  falling stream. Up the  green terrace 
line 28033=>went a stair of stone, high  and  broad, and  on either side of the  topmost  
line 28034=>step were stone-hewn  sea,  There sat other  guards,  with drawn swords laid 
line 28035=>upon their  knees. Their golden hair was braided on their shoulders the  sun 
line 28036=>was blazoned upon  their green shields, their  long  corslets were burnished 
line 28037=>bright, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men. 
line 28038=>     'There are the doors before you,' said the guide. 'I must return now to 
line 28039=>my duty at the gate. Farewell! And  may the Lord  of the Mark be gracious to 
line 28040=>you!' 
line 28041=>     He turned and went swiftly  back down  the road. The others climbed the 
line 28042=>long stair under the eyes of the tall  watchmen. Silent they stood now above  
line 28043=>and spoke no  word, until Gandalf stepped  out upon the paved terrace at the 
line 28044=>stairs head. Then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting  
line 28045=>in their own tongue. 
line 28046=>     Hail, corners from afar!' they said, and they turned the hilts of their 
line 28047=>swords towards the travellers in token of  peace. Green  gems flashed in the 
line 28048=>sunlight.  Then one of the guards stepped forward  and  spoke in  the Common 
line 28049=>Speech. 
line 28050=>     'I am the Doorward of Thjoden,' he said. 'Hbma is my name. Here  I must  
line 28051=>bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter.' 
line 28052=>     Then Legolas gave into his hand his silver -hafted knife, his quiver and 
line 28053=>his bow. 'Keep these well,' he said, 'for they come from the Golden Wood and 
line 28054=>the Lady of Lothlurien gave them to me.' 
line 28055=>     Wonder came into the man's eyes, and he laid the weapons hastily by the  
line 28056=>
line 28057=>####-wall, as if he feared to handle them.  'No  man  will  touch them  I promise 
line 28058=>you,' he said. 
line 28059=>     Aragorn stood a while hesitating. 'It is not my will,' he said,  'to put 
line 28060=>aside my sword or to deliver And®ril to the hand of any other man.' 
line 28061=>     'It is the will of Thjoden,' said Hbma. 
line 28062=>     'It is not clear to  me that the  will of Thjoden son of  Thengel  even 
line 28063=>though  he be lord of the  Mark, should  prevail over the will of Aragorn son  
line 28064=>of Arathorn, Elendil's heir of Gondor.' 
line 28065=>     'This  is the house of  Thjoden, not of Aragorn, even  were  he King of 
line 28066=>Gondor in  the seat of  Denethor,' said Hbma, stepping  swiftly  before  the 
line 28067=>doors  and barring the  way. His sword  was now  in  his  hand and the point  
line 28068=>towards the strangers. 
line 28069=>     'This is idle talk,' said  Gandalf. 'Needless is Thjoden's demand,  but 
line 28070=>it is useless to refuse. A king will have his  way  in his own hall,  be  it 
line 28071=>folly or wisdom.' 
line 28072=>     'Truly,' said Aragorn. 'And I would do as  the master of the house bade 
line 28073=>me, were this only a woodman's cot, if I bore now any sword but And®ril.' 
line 28074=>     'Whatever its name may be,' said Hbma, 'here you shall lay it,  if  you  
line 28075=>would not fight alone against all the men in Edoras.' 
line 28076=>     'Not alone!' said Gimli, fingering  the blade of his axe,  and  looking 
line 28077=>darkly up at the  guard, as if he were a young tree that Gimli had a mind to 
line 28078=>fell. 'Not alone!' 
line 28079=>     'Come, come!' said Gandalf. 'We are all friends here. Or should be; for  
line 28080=>the laughter  of Mordor will be our only reward, if we quarrel. My errand is 
line 28081=>pressing.  Here at least is  my sword, goodman Hbma. Keep it well. Glamdring 
line 28082=>it  is  called,  for the Elves made  it long ago.  Now  let me  pass.  Come, 
line 28083=>Aragorn!' 
line 28084=>     Slowly Aragorn unbuckled  his belt  and  himself set  his sword upright 
line 28085=>against the wall. 'Here I set it,' he  said; 'but I command you not to touch 
line 28086=>it, nor to  permit any other to lay hand on  it. In this elvish heath dwells 
line 28087=>the Blade  that was Broken and has been made again. Telchar first wrought it 
line 28088=>in the deeps of time. Death shall come to any man that draws Elendil's sword 
line 28089=>save Elendil's heir.' 
line 28090=>     The guard stepped back and looked with  amazement on Aragorn. 'It seems 
line 28091=>that you are come on the wings  of song out of the forgotten days he said. It 
line 28092=>shall be, lord, as you command. 
line 28093=>     'Well,' said Gimli, 'if it  has And®ril to keep it company, my  axe may 
line 28094=>
line 28095=>####-stay here, too, without shame'; and  he laid it on the floor. 'Now then,  if 
line 28096=>all is as you wish, let us go and speak with your master.' 
line 28097=>     The guard still  hesitated. 'Your staff,' he  said to Gandalf. 'Forgive 
line 28098=>me, but that too must be left at the doors.' 
line 28099=>     'Foolishness!' said Gandalf. 'Prudence is one thing, but discourtesy is 
line 28100=>another. I am old. If I may  not  lean on my stick  as I go, then I will sit 
line 28101=>out here, until it pleases Thjoden to hobble out himself to speak with me.' 
line 28102=>     Aragorn laughed. 'Every man has something too dear to trust to another. 
line 28103=>But  would you  part an old  man from his suppor t? Come, will you not let us 
line 28104=>enter?' 
line 28105=>     'The staff  in the hand of a wizard may  be more  than a prop for  age' 
line 28106=>said Hbma. He looked hard at  the ash -staff on which Gandalf leaned. 'Yet in 
line 28107=>doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom. I believe you are friends 
line 28108=>and folk worthy of honour, who have no evil purpose. You may go in.' 
line 28109=>     The guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly 
line 28110=>inwards grumbling on  their great hinges. The travellers entered. Inside  it 
line 28111=>seemed  dark and warm after the clear air  upon the hill.  The hall was long 
line 28112=>and wide and filled  with shadows and half lights; mighty pillars upheld its 
line 28113=>lofty roof. But  here and there bright  sunbeams fell  in glimmering  shafts 
line 28114=>from  the  eastern windows, high under the deep eaves. Through the louver in 
line 28115=>the roof, above the thin wisps  of  issuing smoke,  the sky showed  pale and 
line 28116=>blue.  As their  eyes changed, the travellers  perceived  that the floor was 
line 28117=>paved  with  stones  of  many  hues;  branching  runes  and strange  devices 
line 28118=>intertwined  beneath their feet. They  saw now that  the pillars were richly 
line 28119=>carved,  gleaming dully with gold and half-seen  colours.  Many woven cloths 
line 28120=>were hung upon  the  walls,  and over their  wide spaces  marched figures of 
line 28121=>ancient legend, some  dim with years,  some darkling in the shade. But  upon 
line 28122=>one form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a white horse. He was blowing a  
line 28123=>great horn, and his yellow hair was flying in the wind. The horse's head was 
line 28124=>lifted,  and its  nostrils were wide and red  as it neighed, smelling battle 
line 28125=>afar. Foaming water, green and white, rushed and curled about its knees. 
line 28126=>     'Behold  Eorl the Young!'  said Aragorn. 'Thus he rode out of the North 
line 28127=>to the Battle of the Field of Celebrant.' 
line 28128=>     Now the four companions  went forward, past the clear wood-fire burning 
line 28129=>upon the long hearth in  the midst of the hall. Then they halted. At the far 
line 28130=>end of the house, beyond the hearth and facing north towards  the doors, was 
line 28131=>a dais with three steps; and  in the  middle of the dais was a great  gilded 
line 28132=>
line 28133=>####-chair. Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but 
line 28134=>his white  hair was  long and thick and fell  in great braids from beneath a  
line 28135=>thin golden circle set upon his brow.  In the centre upon his forehead shone 
line 28136=>a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his 
line 28137=>eyes  still  burned  with  a bright  light,  glinting  as  he  gazed at  the 
line 28138=>strangers. Behind his  chair  stood  a woman clad in white. At his feet upon 
line 28139=>the  steps sat  a  wizened  figure of a  man,  with  a  pale  wise face  and 
line 28140=>heavy-lidded eyes.  
line 28141=>     There was a silence. The old  man  did not move in his chair. At length 
line 28142=>Gandalf spoke.  'Hail, Thjoden son of Thengel!  I have returned. For behold!  
line 28143=>the  storm  comes,  and now all  friends should  gather together,  lest each 
line 28144=>singly be destroyed.' 
line 28145=>     Slowly the old man rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon a short black  
line 28146=>staff  with a handle of  white bone; and now  the strangers  saw that,  bent 
line 28147=>though he was, he was still tall and must in youth  have been high and proud 
line 28148=>indeed. 
line 28149=>     'I greet you,'  he said,  'and maybe you look for welcome. But truth to 
line 28150=>tell your welcome is  doubtful here,  Master Gandalf.  You have ever  been a  
line 28151=>herald  of  woe. Troubles follow you like crows,  and ever  the oftener  the 
line 28152=>worse. I will  not deceive  you: when I heard that Shadowfax had  come  back 
line 28153=>riderless, I rejoiced at the return of the horse, but still more at the lack  
line 28154=>of the rider; and when Jomer brought the  tidings that you  had gone at last 
line 28155=>to your long home, I did not mourn. But news from afar is seldom sooth. Here 
line 28156=>you  come  again! And with you come  evils  worse  than before, as  might be 
line 28157=>expected. Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow? Tell me that.' 
line 28158=>Slowly  
line 28159=>he sat down again in his cha ir. 
line 28160=>     'You speak justly, lord,'  said the pale man sitting upon the steps  of 
line 28161=>the  dais. 'It is not  yet five  days since  the  bitter  tidings  came that 
line 28162=>Thjodred your son was slain upon  the West  Marches: your right hand, Second 
line 28163=>Marshal Of the Mark. In Jomer  there  is little trust. Few men would be left  
line 28164=>to guard your walls, if  he had been allowed to rule.  And even now we learn 
line 28165=>from Gondor that the Dark Lord is stirring in the East. Such  is the hour in 
line 28166=>which this wanderer chooses to return. Why indeed  should  we  welcome  you, 
line 28167=>Master Stormcrow?  Lbthspell I  name you,  Ill-news; and ill news is  an ill 
line 28168=>guest they say.' He laughed grimly, as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment 
line 28169=>and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes.  
line 28170=>
line 28171=>####-     'You are  held wise, my friend Wormtongue,  and are  doubtless a  great 
line 28172=>support to your master,' answered Gandalf in a soft voice. 'Yet in two  ways 
line 28173=>may a man  come with evil tidings. lie may be a worker of evil; or he may be 
line 28174=>such as leaves well alone, and comes only to bring aid in time of need.' 
line 28175=>     'That  is so,' said Wormtongue; 'but there is a  third kind: pickers of 
line 28176=>bones, meddlers in other men's sorrows, carrion-fowl  that grow fat  on war. 
line 28177=>What aid have you ever brought, Stormcrow? And what aid do you bring now? 
line 28178=>It 
line 28179=>was  aid from  us that you sought last time that you were here. Then my lord 
line 28180=>bade you  Choose any horse that you would and be gone; and  to the wonder of 
line 28181=>all you took Shadowfax in your insolence. My lord was sorely grieved; yet to 
line 28182=>some it seemed that to speed you from the land the price was not  too great. 
line 28183=>I guess that it is  likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid 
line 28184=>rather than  render  it. Do  you  bring men?  Do you bring  horses,  swords,  
line 28185=>spears? That I  would call aid; that is our present need. But  who are these 
line 28186=>that  follow at your tail? Three ragged wanderers in grey,  and you yourself 
line 28187=>the most beggar-like of the four!' 
line 28188=>     'The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Thjoden son of 
line 28189=>Thengel,' said  Gandalf. 'Has not the  messenger from your gate reported the 
line 28190=>names of my companions? Seldom  has any lord of  Rohan received  three  
line 28191=>such 
line 28192=>guests. Weapons they have  laid at your doors  that  are worth many a mortal 
line 28193=>man, even the mightiest. Grey is their raiment, for the Elves clad them, and 
line 28194=>thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall.' 
line 28195=>     'Then it  is true, as  Jomer reported, that  you are in league with the 
line 28196=>Sorceress of the Golden Wood?'  said Wormtongue. 'It  is not  to be wondered 
line 28197=>at: webs of deceit were ever woven in Dwimordene.' 
line 28198=>     Gimli  strode  a pace forward, but felt  suddenly  the hand  of Gandalf 
line 28199=>clutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as stone. 
line 28200=>     In Dwimordene, in Lurien 
line 28201=>     Seldom have walked the feet of Men, 
line 28202=>     Few mortal eyes have seen the light 
line 28203=>     That lies there ever, long and bright. 
line 28204=>     Galadriel! Galadriel! 
line 28205=>     Clear is the water of your well; 
line 28206=>     White is the star in your white hand; 
line 28207=>     Unmarred, unstained is leaf and land 
line 28208=>
line 28209=>####-     In Dwimordene, in Lurien 
line 28210=>     More fair than thoughts of Mortal Men. 
line 28211=>     Thus Gandalf softly  sang, and then suddenly  he changed.  Casting  his 
line 28212=>tattered cloak aside, he stood up and leaned  no longer on his staff; and he 
line 28213=>spoke in a clear cold voice.  'The wise speak only  of what they know, Grnma 
line 28214=>son of Gblmud. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and 
line 28215=>keep 
line 28216=>your forked tongue behind  your  teeth.  I  have not passed through fire and 
line 28217=>death to bandy crooked words  with a serving-man till the  lightning falls.' 
line 28218=>He raised his staff.  There was a roll of thunder. The  sunlight was blotted 
line 28219=>out from the eastern  windows; the whole hall became suddenly dark as night. 
line 28220=>The fire faded to sullen embers. Only Gandalf could be seen,  standing white 
line 28221=>and tall before the blackened hearth. 
line 28222=>     In the gloom they heard  the hiss  of  Wormtongue's voice:  'Did I  not 
line 28223=>counsel you, lord, to forbid  his  staff? That fool, Hbma, has betrayed us!' 
line 28224=>There was  a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof. Then all was silent. 
line 28225=>Wormtongue sprawled on his face. 
line 28226=>     'Now Thjoden son of Thengel, will you hearken to me?' said Gandalf. 'Do 
line 28227=>you ask for help?' He lifted his staff and pointed to a  high  window. There 
line 28228=>the darkness  seemed  to clear, and  through the opening could be seen, high 
line 28229=>and far, a patch of shining sky. 'Not all is dark. Take courage, Lord of the 
line 28230=>Mark; for better help you will not  find. No counsel have I to give to those 
line 28231=>that despair. Yet counsel I could give, and words I could speak to you. Will 
line 28232=>you  hear them? They are not for all  ears.  I bid you come out  before your 
line 28233=>doors  and look abroad.  Too  long have  you sat in  shadows and  trusted to 
line 28234=>twisted tales and crooked promptings.' 
line 28235=>     Slowly  Thjoden left his  chair. A faint light  grew in the hall again. 
line 28236=>The  woman hastened to  the king's side, taking his arm, and with  faltering 
line 28237=>steps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall. 
line 28238=>Wormtongue remained lying on the floor. They came to  the  doors and 
line 28239=>Gandalf 
line 28240=>knocked. 
line 28241=>     'Open!' he cried. 'The Lord of the Mark comes forth!' 
line 28242=>     The doors rolled  back  and a keen air  came whistling in.  A wind  was 
line 28243=>blowing  on  the  hill.  'Send your guards down  to the stairs  foot,'  said 
line 28244=>Gandalf. 'And you, lady, leave him a while with me. I will care for him.' 
line 28245=>     'Go, Jowyn sister -daughter!' said the  old king. 'The time for  fear is 
line 28246=>
line 28247=>####-past.' 
line 28248=>     The woman turned  and went slowly into  the house. As  she  passed  the  
line 28249=>doors  she turned and looked back. Grave  and thoughtful  was her glance, as 
line 28250=>she looked on the king with cool  pity in her eyes. Very fair was  her face, 
line 28251=>and her long hair was like a river of gold. Slender and tall  she was in her  
line 28252=>white  robe girt with  silver; but strong she seemed and  stern as steel,  a  
line 28253=>daughter of kings. Thus Aragorn for the first time in the  full light of day 
line 28254=>beheld  Jowyn, Lady of Rohan, and thought her fair, fair  and cold,  like  a  
line 28255=>morning of  pale spring that  is not yet come to womanhood. And she  now was 
line 28256=>suddenly  aware  of  him:  tall  heir  of kings,  wise  with  many  winters, 
line 28257=>greycloaked.  Hiding a power that yet she felt.  For a moment still as stone 
line 28258=>she stood, then turning swiftly she was gone. 
line 28259=>     'Now, lord,' said Gandalf, 'look out upon  your land!  Breathe the free 
line 28260=>air again!' 
line 28261=>     From  the porch upon the top  of the high terrace they could see beyond 
line 28262=>the stream the green fields of Rohan fading  into distant grey.  Curtains of 
line 28263=>wind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and  to the west was still 
line 28264=>dark with thunder, and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden 
line 28265=>hills. But the wind had shifted to the north, and already the storm that had 
line 28266=>come  out of  the  East  was  receding, rolling away  southward to  the sea. 
line 28267=>Suddenly through a rent  in  the clouds behind them a shaft  of sun  stabbed 
line 28268=>down. The falling  showers  gleamed  like  silver,  and  far away the  river  
line 28269=>glittered like a shimmering glass. 
line 28270=>     'It is not so dark here,' said Thjoden. 
line 28271=>     'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor does age lie so  heavily on your  shoulders as 
line 28272=>some would have you think. Cast aside your prop!' 
line 28273=>     From the  king's hand the black staff fell clattering on the stones. He 
line 28274=>drew himself up, slowly, as a man  that is stiff from long bending over some 
line 28275=>dull toil.  Now tall  and straight he stood,  and his  eyes were blue as  he 
line 28276=>looked into the opening sky. 
line 28277=>     'Dark have  been  my  dreams  of late,' he said,  'but  I  feel as  one 
line 28278=>new-awakened. I would now that you had come before, Gandalf. For I fear that 
line 28279=>already  you have come  too late, only to see the last days of my house. Not 
line 28280=>long now shall stand the high hall which Brego son of Eorl built. Fire shall 
line 28281=>devour the high seat. What is to be done?' 
line 28282=>     'Much,' said Gandalf. 'But first send for Jomer. Do I not guess rightly 
line 28283=>that  you hold him prisoner,  by the counsel of Grnma, of him that all  save 
line 28284=>
line 28285=>####-you name the Wormtongue?' 
line 28286=>     'It is  true,' said Thjoden. 'He  had rebelled against my commands, and 
line 28287=>threatened death to Grnma in my hall.' 
line 28288=>     'A man  may love you  and yet not love Wormtongue or his counsels' said 
line 28289=>Gandalf. 
line 28290=>     'That may be. I will  do as you ask. Call  Hbma to  me. Since he proved 
line 28291=>untrusty  as a  doorward, let him  become an errand -runner. The guilty shall  
line 28292=>bring the guilty to judgement,' said Thjoden, and his voice was grim, yet he 
line 28293=>looked  at  Gandalf and  smiled and  as  he did so many lines  of care  were 
line 28294=>smoothed away and did not return. 
line 28295=>     When  Hbma  had  been  summoned and had  gone, Gandalf led Thjoden to 
line 28296=>a 
line 28297=>stone seat, and then sat  himself before  the  king upon  the topmost stair. 
line 28298=>Aragorn and his companions stood nearby. 
line 28299=>     'There is no time to tell all that you should hear,' said Gandalf. 'Yet 
line 28300=>if my  hope is not cheated, a time will come ere  long when I can speak more 
line 28301=>fully. Behold! you  are  come into  a peril  greater  even  than the wit  of 
line 28302=>Wormtongue could weave into your dreams. But see!  you  dream no longer. 
line 28303=>You 
line 28304=>live.  Gondor and  Rohan do not stand alone. The enemy  is strong beyond our 
line 28305=>reckoning, yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed.' 
line 28306=>     Quickly now Gandalf spoke. His voice  was low and secret, and none save 
line 28307=>the  king heard what he said. But  ever as he spoke the light shone brighter  
line 28308=>in Thjoden's eye, and at  the last he rose from his seat to his full height, 
line 28309=>and  Gandalf  beside him, and  together  they looked out from the high place 
line 28310=>towards the East. 
line 28311=>     'Verily,' said Gandalf, now in a loud voice,  keen and clear, 'that way 
line 28312=>lies our hope,  where sits our greatest  fear. Doom hangs still on a thread. 
line 28313=>Yet  hope  there  is  still, if we can  but  stand  unconquered for a little 
line 28314=>while.' 
line 28315=>     The others  too  now  turned their  eyes eastward.  Over the  sundering 
line 28316=>leagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope and fear 
line 28317=>bore their thoughts  still on, beyond dark  mountains to the Land of Shadow.  
line 28318=>Where now was the  Ring-bearer? How thin  indeed was  the thread  upon 
line 28319=>which 
line 28320=>doom  still hung! It seemed to Legolas, as he  strained his farseeing  eyes, 
line 28321=>that he caught a  glint  of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on  a  
line 28322=>
line 28323=>####-pinnacle of the  Tower of Guard. And further still, endlessly remote and yet 
line 28324=>a present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame. 
line 28325=>     Slowly  Thjoden  sat  down again,  as if  weariness still struggled  to 
line 28326=>master  him against the will  of Gandalf.  He turned and looked at his great 
line 28327=>house. 'Alas!'  he said, 'that these evil days  should  be  mine, and should 
line 28328=>come in my old  age instead of that peace  which  I  have earned.  Alas  for  
line 28329=>Boromir  the  brave!  The young  perish and the old  linger,  withering.' He 
line 28330=>clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands. 
line 28331=>     'Your fi ngers would remember their old strength better, if they grasped 
line 28332=>a sword-hilt,' said Gandalf. 
line 28333=>     Thjoden rose and put his  hand to his  side;  but no sword hung at  his 
line 28334=>belt. 'Where has Grnma stowed it?' he muttered under his breath. 
line 28335=>     'Take this,  dear lord!'  said  a  clear  voice.  'It  was ever at your 
line 28336=>service.' Two  men had  come softly up the  stair and stood now a few  steps  
line 28337=>from the top. Jomer was there. No helm was on his head, no  mail  was on his 
line 28338=>breast, but in  his hand he  held a drawn sword; and as he knelt  he offered 
line 28339=>the hilt to his master. 
line 28340=>     'How comes this?' said Thjoden sternly. He turned towards Jomer and the  
line 28341=>men looked in wonder at him, standing now proud and erect. Where was the 
line 28342=>old 
line 28343=>man whom they had left crouching in his chair or leaning on his stick? 
line 28344=>     'It is my doing,  lord,' said Hbma,  trembling. I understood that Jomer  
line 28345=>was  to be set free. Such  joy was in my heart that maybe I have erred. Yet, 
line 28346=>since  he was free again, and he  a  Marshal of  the Mark,!  brought him his 
line 28347=>sword as he bade me.' 
line 28348=>     'To lay at your feet, my lord,' said Jomer. 
line 28349=>     For a moment of silence Thjoden stood looking down at Jomer as he knelt 
line 28350=>still before him. Neither moved. 
line 28351=>     'Will you not take the sword?' said Gandalf.  
line 28352=>     Slowly Thjoden stretched forth his hand. As his fingers  took the hilt, 
line 28353=>it seemed  to the watchers that  firmness  and strength returned to his thin 
line 28354=>arm. Suddenly he  lifted the blade  and swung it shimmering and whistling in 
line 28355=>the air. Then he gave a great cry. His voice rang clear as he chanted in the 
line 28356=>tongue of Rohan a call to arms. 
line 28357=>     Arise now, arise, Riders of Thjoden! 
line 28358=>     Dire deeds awake, dark is it eastward. 
line 28359=>     Let horse be bridled, horn be sounded! 
line 28360=>
line 28361=>####-     Forth Eorlingas! 
line 28362=>     The guards, thinking that they were summoned, sprang up the stair. They 
line 28363=>looked at  their lord  in amazement, and  then  as one  man they  drew their 
line 28364=>swords and laid them at his feet. 'Command us!' they said. 
line 28365=>     'Westu Thjoden hbl!' cried Jomer. 'It  is a joy to us to see you return 
line 28366=>into your  own.  Never  again  shall it be said, Gandalf, that you come only 
line 28367=>with grief!' 
line 28368=>     'Take  back your sword, Jomer, sister -son!'  said  the king. 'Go, Hbma, 
line 28369=>and  seek my own sword!  Grnma has it in his keeping. Bring him to  me also. 
line 28370=>Now, Gandalf,  you said   that  you had counsel to  give, if I would hear it.  
line 28371=>What is your counsel?' 
line 28372=>     'You have yourself already  taken it,' answered Gandalf.  'To put  your 
line 28373=>trust in Jomer, rather than in a man of crooked mind.  To cast aside  regret 
line 28374=>and fear.  To do the deed at hand. Every  man that can ride should  be  sent 
line 28375=>west at once, as  Jomer counselled you: we must first destroy the  threat of 
line 28376=>Saruman, while we have time. If we fail, we  fall. If we succeed  -- then  we 
line 28377=>will  face the next task. Meanwhile your people tha t are left, the women and 
line 28378=>the children and the old, should stay  to the refuges  that  you have in the 
line 28379=>mountains. Were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this? Let  
line 28380=>them  take  provision, but delay not, nor burden themselves  with treasures,  
line 28381=>great or small. It is their lives that are at stake.' 
line 28382=>     'This counsel seems good to me now,' said Thjoden. 'Let all my folk get 
line 28383=>ready! But  you my guests-truly you  said, Gandalf, that the  courtesy of my  
line 28384=>hall is  lessened. You have ridden through the night,  and the morning wears 
line 28385=>away.  You have had  neither  sleep nor food. A  guest -house  shall be  made  
line 28386=>ready: there you shall sleep, when you have eaten.' 
line 28387=>     'Nay, lord,' said Aragorn. 'There is no rest yet for the weary. The men 
line 28388=>of Rohan must ride forth today, and we  will ride with them, axe, sword, and  
line 28389=>bow. We did not bring them to rest against your wall, Lord  of the Mark. And 
line 28390=>I promised Jomer that my sword and his should be drawn together.' 
line 28391=>     'Now indeed there is hope of victory!' said Jomer. 
line 28392=>     'Hope,  yes,' said Gandalf. 'But Isengard  is strong. And  other perils 
line 28393=>draw ever nearer. Do not delay, Thjoden,  when we are gone. Lead your people 
line 28394=>swiftly to the Hold of Dunharrow in the hills!' 
line 28395=>     'Nay,  Gandalf!' said  the king.  'You do not know your  own  skill  in 
line 28396=>healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall  in  the front 
line 28397=>of the battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.' 
line 28398=>
line 28399=>####-     'Then even the defeat of Rohan will be glorious in song,' said Aragorn. 
line 28400=>The armed men that st ood  near clashed their weapons, crying:  'The  Lord of 
line 28401=>the Mark will ride! Forth Eorlingas!' 
line 28402=>     'But  your  people  must  not be  both  unarmed and shepherdless'  said 
line 28403=>Gandalf. 'Who shall guide them and govern them in your place?' 
line 28404=>     'I will take thought for that  ere I go,' answered Thjoden. 'Here comes 
line 28405=>my counsellor.' 
line 28406=>     At  that moment  Hbma  came  again from  the hall. Behind him  cringing  
line 28407=>between two other men, came Grnma  the  Wormtongue. His face was very 
line 28408=>white. 
line 28409=>His eyes blinked in the sunlight. Hbma knelt and presented to Thjoden a long 
line 28410=>sword in a scabbard clasped with gold and  set with green gems. 'Here, lord,  
line 28411=>is Herugrim, your  ancient blade,' he said. 'It was found in his chest. Loth 
line 28412=>was  he to render up  the  keys. Many other things are there which  men have 
line 28413=>missed.' 
line 28414=>     'You lie,'  said Wormtongue.  'And  this sword your master himself gave 
line 28415=>into my keeping.' 
line 28416=>     'And  he  now  requires  it  of  you again,' said  Thjoden. 'Does  that 
line 28417=>displease you?' 
line 28418=>     'Assuredly not. lord,' said  Wormtongue. 'I care for you and  yours  as 
line 28419=>best I may. But do not weary yourself, or tax too heavily your strength. Let 
line 28420=>others deal  with these irksome guests. Your meat is  about to be set on the 
line 28421=>board. Will you not go to it?' 
line 28422=>     'I will,' said Thjoden. 'And let food for my guests be set on the board 
line 28423=>beside me. The host rides today. Send the heralds forth! Let them summon all 
line 28424=>who dwell nigh!  Every  man and strong lad able to bear  arms,  all who have 
line 28425=>horses, let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour from 
line 28426=>noon!' 
line 28427=>     'Dear  lord!'  cried Wormtongue.  'It  is as I feared. This wizard  has 
line 28428=>bewitched  you.  Are  none  to  be  left to defend  the  Golden Hall of your 
line 28429=>fathers, and all your treasure? None to guard the Lord of the Mark?' 
line 28430=>     'If this is bewitchment,' said Thjoden, 'it seems to me more  wholesome 
line 28431=>than your whisperings. Your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on 
line 28432=>all  fours like  a beast.  No, not  one shall be left, not even Grnma. Grnma  
line 28433=>shall ride too. Go! You have ye t time to clean the rust from your sword.' 
line 28434=>     'Mercy, lord!' whined Wormtongue,  grovelling on the ground. 'Have pity 
line 28435=>on one worn out in your service. Send me not from your side! I at least will 
line 28436=>
line 28437=>####-stand by you  when all  others have gone.  Do  not send your  faithful Grnma  
line 28438=>away!' 
line 28439=>     'You have my pity,' said Thjoden. 'And I do not send you from my  side. 
line 28440=>I  go myself to  war with my  men.  I  bid  you come with me and prove  your 
line 28441=>faith.' 
line 28442=>     Wormtongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted look of 
line 28443=>a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies. He licked his lips with 
line 28444=>a  long pale tongue. 'Such a resolve  might be expected  from a lord of  the 
line 28445=>House  of Eorl,  old though  he be,' he  said. 'But those who truly love him 
line 28446=>would spare his failing years. Yet I  see that I come too late. Others, whom 
line 28447=>the death of my lord would perhaps grieve less, have already persuaded  him. 
line 28448=>If I cannot undo their work,  hear me at least in  this, lord! One who knows 
line 28449=>your mind  and honours your  commands shou ld  be  left in  Edoras. Appoint a  
line 28450=>faithful  steward.  Let your  counsellor Grnma  keep  all  things till  your 
line 28451=>return-and  I pray  that we  may  see it,  though no  wise man  will deem it 
line 28452=>hopeful.' 
line 28453=>     Jomer  laughed. 'And if  that plea does not excuse you  from war,  most  
line 28454=>noble Wormtongue,' he said, what office of less honour would you accept?  To 
line 28455=>carry a sack of meal up  into the mountains-if any man would trust you  with  
line 28456=>it?' 
line 28457=>     'Nay,  Jomer,  you  do  not  fully  understand   the  mind   of  Master  
line 28458=>Wormtongue,' said Gandalf, turning his piercing glance upon him. 'He is bold 
line 28459=>and cunning. Even now he plays a game with  peril and wins a throw. Hours of 
line 28460=>my precious time he has wasted already. 'Down snake!' he said suddenly in  a 
line 28461=>terrible voice. 'Down on  your belly!  How long is it  since  Saruman bought 
line 28462=>you? What was  the promised price? When all the  men were  dead, you were to 
line 28463=>pick your  share of  the treasure, and take the woman  you  desire? Too long 
line 28464=>have you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps.' 
line 28465=>     Jomer grasped his sword. 'That I knew  already,' he muttered. 'For that 
line 28466=>reason I would  have slain him  before,  forgetting the law of the hall. But 
line 28467=>there are other reasons.' He  stepped forward,  but Gandalf stayed him  with 
line 28468=>his hand. 
line 28469=>     'Jowyn is safe now,' he said. 'But you, Wormtongue,  you have done what 
line 28470=>you could for  your  true master.  Some reward you have earned at least. Yet 
line 28471=>Saruman is apt to  overlook his bargains. I should advise you  to go quickly 
line 28472=>and remind him, lest he forget your faithful service.' 
line 28473=>     'You lie,' said Wormtongue. 
line 28474=>
line 28475=>####-     'That word comes too oft and easy from  your lips,' said Gandalf. 'I do 
line 28476=>not lie. See, Thjoden, here is a snake! With  safety you cannot take it with 
line 28477=>you,  nor can you leave it behind. To slay it  would be just. But it was not 
line 28478=>always as it now is. Once it was a man,  and did you service in its fashion. 
line 28479=>Give him a horse and  let him go at once, wherever he chooses. By his choice 
line 28480=>you shall judge him.' 
line 28481=>     'Do  you hear this, Wormtongue?' said Thjoden. 'This is your choice: to 
line 28482=>ride with me to war, and let us see in battle whether you are true; or to go 
line 28483=>now,  whither  you will. But  then, if ever we  meet again, I  shall not  be 
line 28484=>merciful.' 
line 28485=>     Slowly Wormtongue rose. He  looked  at them with half-closed eyes. Last 
line 28486=>of all he scanned Thjoden's face and opened his mouth  as if  to speak. Then  
line 28487=>suddenly he drew  himself up.  His  hands  worked. His eyes glittered.  Such 
line 28488=>malice was in them that men stepped  back from  him. He bared his teeth; and 
line 28489=>then with a  hissing breath he spat before the king's feet, and  darting  to 
line 28490=>one side, he fled down the stair. 
line 28491=>     'After him!' said Thjoden. 'See that he does no harm to any, but do not 
line 28492=>hurt him or hinder him. Give him a horse, if he wishes it.' 
line 28493=>     'And if any will bear him,' said Jomer. 
line 28494=>     One of the guards ran down the stair.  Another went to the  well at the 
line 28495=>foot of  the terrace and in his helm drew water. With it he washed clean the 
line 28496=>stones that Wormtongue had defiled. 
line 28497=>     'Now my guests, come!' said Thjoden. 'Come and take such refreshment as 
line 28498=>haste allows.' 
line 28499=>     They passed back into the great house. Already they heard below them in  
line 28500=>the town the heralds crying and the  war -horns  blowing. For the king was to 
line 28501=>ride forth as soon as the  men of the  town and those dwelling near could be 
line 28502=>armed and assembled. 
line 28503=>     At the  king's  board sat  Jomer  and  the four guests, and there  also 
line 28504=>waiting  upon  the king was  the lady Jowyn. They ate and drank swiftly. The 
line 28505=>others were silent while Thjoden questioned Gandalf concerning Saruman. 
line 28506=>     'How far back his treachery goes, who can guess?' said Gandalf. 'He was 
line 28507=>not always evil. Once  I  do not doubt that he  was the friend of Rohan; and 
line 28508=>even when his heart grew colder, he found you useful still. But for long now 
line 28509=>he  has plotted  your  ruin, wearing the  mask of Friendship,  until  he was 
line 28510=>ready. In those years Wormtongue's task was easy, and all that  you did  was 
line 28511=>swiftly known in Isengard; for your  land  was  open, and strangers came and 
line 28512=>
line 28513=>####-went. And  ever Wormtongue's  whispering was  in your ears,  poisoning  your 
line 28514=>thought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and 
line 28515=>could do nothing, for your will was in his keeping. 
line 28516=>     'But  when I escaped and  warned you, then the mask was torn, for those 
line 28517=>who would see. After  that Wormtongue played dangerously, always  seeking 
line 28518=>to 
line 28519=>delay  you, to  prevent  your full strength being gathered.  He  was crafty: 
line 28520=>dulling men's  wariness, or working on their fears,  as served the occasion. 
line 28521=>Do you not remember how eagerly  he urged  that no man should be spared on 
line 28522=>a 
line 28523=>wildgoose  chase  northward,  when  the  immediate  peril was  westward?  He 
line 28524=>persuaded you  to  forbid Jomer to pursue the raiding Orcs. If Jomer had not  
line 28525=>defied  Wormtongue's voice speaking  with your mouth, those Orcs would  
line 28526=>have 
line 28527=>reached Isengard by now,  bearing a great prize. Not indeed that prize which  
line 28528=>Saruman desires  above all else, but at the least two members of my Company, 
line 28529=>sharers of a  secret hope, of  which even  to you,  lord, I cannot yet speak 
line 28530=>openly. Dare you think of what they might now be  suffering, or what Saruman 
line 28531=>might now have learned to our destruction?' 
line 28532=>     'I owe much to  Jomer,' said Thjoden. 'Faithful heart  may have forward 
line 28533=>tongue.' 'Say also,' said  Gandalf,  'that to crooked  eyes truth may wear a  
line 28534=>wry face.' 
line 28535=>     'Indeed my eyes were almost blind,' said Thjoden. 'Most of all I owe to 
line 28536=>you, my guest. Once again you have come in time. I would give you a gift ere 
line 28537=>we  go, at your own  choosing. You  have only to name aught  that is mine. I 
line 28538=>reserve now only my sword!' 
line 28539=>     'Whether I came in time or not is yet  to be  seen,' said Gandalf. 'But 
line 28540=>as for your gift, lord, I will choose  one that will fit my need: swift  and 
line 28541=>sure. Give me Shadowfax! He was  only lent  before, if loan we may  call it.  
line 28542=>But now shall ride  him into great hazard,  setting silver against  black: I 
line 28543=>would not risk anything that is not my own.  And already there is  a bond of 
line 28544=>love between us.' 
line 28545=>     'You choose  well,' said Thjoden; 'and I give him now gladly. Yet it  is 
line 28546=>a great  gift. There  is none like  to Shadowfax. In him  one of  the mighty 
line 28547=>steeds of old  has returned. None  such shall  return again. And  to you  my 
line 28548=>other guests I  will offer such things as may be found in my armoury. Swords 
line 28549=>you  do  not need,  but there  are helms and coats  of mail of cunning work, 
line 28550=>
line 28551=>####-gifts to my fathers out of Gondor. Choose from these ere we go, and may they 
line 28552=>serve you well!' 
line 28553=>     Now men came bearing  raiment  of  war from  the  king's hoard and they 
line 28554=>arrayed Aragorn and Legolas in shining mail. Helms too they chose, and round 
line 28555=>shields: their bosses were  overlaid with gold and set with gems,  green and 
line 28556=>red  and white.  Gandalf took no armour; and Gimli needed no coat of  rings, 
line 28557=>even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in 
line 28558=>the hoards of Edoras  of  better make than his short corslet forged  beneath 
line 28559=>the Mountain  in the North.  But he  chose a  cap of iron  and leather  that 
line 28560=>fitted well upon his  round head; and  a small  shield he also took. It bore 
line 28561=>the  running  horse,  white upon green, that was the emblem of  the House of 
line 28562=>Eorl. 
line 28563=>     'May it keep you well!' said Thjoden.  'It was made for me in Thengel's 
line 28564=>day, while still I was a boy.' 
line 28565=>     Gimli bowed.  'I am proud, Lord  of the Mark, to bear your  device,' he 
line 28566=>said. 'Indeed  sooner would I bear a  horse than be borne by one. I  love my 
line 28567=>feet better. But, maybe, I shall come yet where I can stand and fight.' 
line 28568=>     'It may well be so,' said Thjoden. 
line 28569=>     The king now rose, and at once Jowyn came forward bearing wine.  'Ferthu 
line 28570=>Thjoden hbl!' she  said. 'Receive  now this  cup  and drink  in happy  hour. 
line 28571=>Health be with thee at thy going and coming!' 
line 28572=>     Thjoden drank from the cup, and she then proffered it to the guests. As 
line 28573=>she stood before  Aragorn she paused suddenly and  looked  upon him, and her 
line 28574=>eyes were shining. And he  looked down upon her fair face and smiled; but as 
line 28575=>he took the cup, his hand  met hers,  and he knew  that she trembled at  the 
line 28576=>touch. 'Hail  Aragorn son of Arathorn!' she said. 'Hail Lady of  Rohan!'  he 
line 28577=>answered, but his face now was troubled and he did not smile. 
line 28578=>     When  they had  all drunk, the king went  down  the hall to  the doors.  
line 28579=>There  the  guards awaited him, and  heralds  stood, and all  the  lords and 
line 28580=>chiefs were gathered together that remained in Edoras or dwelt nearby. 
line 28581=>     'Behold! I  go forth, and  it  seems like to be  my last riding,'  said 
line 28582=>Thjoden. 'I have  no  child. Thjodred  my  son  is  slain.  I name Jomer  my 
line 28583=>sister -son to be my heir. If neither of us return, then choose a new lord as 
line 28584=>you will. But to some one I must now entrust my people that I  leave behind,  
line 28585=>to rule them in my place. Which of you will stay?' 
line 28586=>     No man spoke. 
line 28587=>     'Is there none whom you would name? In whom do my people trust?' 
line 28588=>
line 28589=>####-     'In the House of Eorl,' answered Hbma. 
line 28590=>     'But Jomer I cannot spare, nor  would he stay,'  said the king; 'and he 
line 28591=>is the last of that House.' 
line 28592=>     'I  said not Jomer,'  answered Hbma. 'And he is not the  last. There is 
line 28593=>Jowyn, daughter of Jomund, his sister. She is fearless and high-hearted. All 
line 28594=>love her. Let her be as lord to the Eorlingas, while we are gone.' 
line 28595=>     'It shall be so,' said Thjoden. 'Let the heralds  announce to  the folk  
line 28596=>that the Lady Jowyn will lead them!' 
line 28597=>     Then the king sat upon a seat before his doors, and  Jowyn knelt before 
line 28598=>him   and  received  from   him  a  sword  and  a  fair  corslet.  'Farewell 
line 28599=>sister -daughter!' he said. 'Dark is the hour, yet maybe we shall  return  to 
line 28600=>the Golden Hall. But in Dunharrow the people may long defend themselves, 
line 28601=>and 
line 28602=>if the battle go ill, thither will come all who escape.' 'Speak not so!' she 
line 28603=>answered.  'A  year shall I endure  for every  day  that passes  until  your 
line 28604=>return.' But as she spoke her eyes went to Aragorn who stood nearby. 
line 28605=>     'The king shall come again,' he said.  'Fear not! Not West but East does 
line 28606=>our doom await us.' 
line 28607=>     The  king now went down  the stair  with Gandalf beside him. The others 
line 28608=>followed. Aragorn looked back  as they  passed towards the gate. Alone Jowyn 
line 28609=>stood before the  doors of the house at the stair's head; the  sword was set 
line 28610=>upright before her, and her hands were laid upon the hilt. She was  clad now 
line 28611=>in mail and shone like silver in the sun. 
line 28612=>     Gimli walked with Legolas. his axe on his  shoulder. 'Well, at last  we 
line 28613=>set off!' he said. 'Men need many words before deeds. My  axe is restless in 
line 28614=>my  hands.  Though I doubt not that these Rohirrim are fell -handed when they 
line 28615=>come  to it. Nonetheless this is not the warfare  that suits me. How shall I 
line 28616=>come to  the battle?  I  wish  I  could  walk and  not  bump like a sack  at 
line 28617=>Gandalf's saddlebow.' 
line 28618=>     'A safer seat than many, I guess,' said Legolas. 'Yet doubtless Gandalf 
line 28619=>will  gladly put you  down  on  your  feet  when  blows  begin; or Shadowfax 
line 28620=>himself. An axe is no weapon for a rider.' 
line 28621=>     'And a Dwarf is no horseman. It is orc-necks I would hew, not shave the 
line 28622=>scalps of Men,' said Gimli, patting the haft of his axe. 
line 28623=>     At the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in 
line 28624=>the saddle. More than a thousand were there mustered. Their spears were like 
line 28625=>a springing wood. Loudly and  joyously  they shouted as  Thjoden came forth. 
line 28626=>
line 28627=>####-Some  held in  readiness the  king's horse, Snowmane,  and  others  held the 
line 28628=>horses of  Aragorn and Legolas. Gimli stood ill at ease, frowning, bu t Jomer  
line 28629=>came up to him, leading his horse. 
line 28630=>     'Hail,  Gimli Gluin's  son!' he cried.  'I have  not had  time to learn 
line 28631=>gentle speech under your  rod, as you promised. But  shall  we not put aside  
line 28632=>our quarrel? At least I will speak no evil again of the Lady of the Wood.' 
line 28633=>     'I will forget my wrath for  a while, Jomer son of Jomund,' said Gimli; 
line 28634=>'but if ever you chance to  see the Lady Galadriel with your eyes, then  you  
line 28635=>shall  acknowledge her  the fairest of  ladies, or our friendship will end.' 
line 28636=>'So be  it!' said Jomer.  'But  until that  time pardon me, and  in token of 
line 28637=>pardon ride with me, I beg. Gandalf will be at the head with the Lord of the 
line 28638=>Mark; but Firefoot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.' 
line 28639=>     'I thank  you  indeed,' said Gimli  greatly   pleased. 'I will gladly go 
line 28640=>with you, if Legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.' 
line 28641=>     'It shall he so,'  said Jomer. 'Legolas upon  my left, and Aragorn upon 
line 28642=>my right, and none will dare to stand before us!' 
line 28643=>     'Where is Shadowfax?' said Gandalf.  
line 28644=>     'Running  wild  over the grass,' they  answered.  'He  will let  no man 
line 28645=>handle him. There he goes, away down by the  ford, like a  shadow among  the 
line 28646=>willows.' 
line 28647=>     Gandalf  whistled  and called aloud the horse's  name,  and far away he 
line 28648=>tossed  his head and neighed,  and  turning sped  towards the host  like  an 
line 28649=>arrow. 
line 28650=>     'Were the breath of the West Wind to take a body visible, even so would 
line 28651=>it appear,' said Jomer, as the great horse ran up, until he stood before the 
line 28652=>wizard. 
line 28653=>     'The gift seems already to be  given,'  said Thjoden. 'But hearken all! 
line 28654=>Here  now I name my  guest, Gandalf  Greyhame,  wisest of  counsellors; most  
line 28655=>welcome of wanderers, a lord of the Mark, a chieftain of the Eorlingas while  
line 28656=>our kin shall last; and I give to him Shadowfax, prince of horses.' 
line 28657=>     'I thank you, Thjoden King,' said Gandalf. Then suddenly he threw  back  
line 28658=>his grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to horseback. He  wore no 
line 28659=>helm nor mail. His snowy hair  flew free in the wind, his  white robes shone 
line 28660=>dazzling in  the sun. 
line 28661=>     'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn, and all took up the words.  
line 28662=>     'Our King and the White Rider!' they shouted. 'Forth Eorlingas!' 
line 28663=>     The trumpets sounded. The horses reared and neighed.  Spear  clashed on  
line 28664=>
line 28665=>####-shield. Then the king raised his hand, and with a rush like the sudden onset 
line 28666=>of a great wind  the  last host of Rohan rode thundering into  the West. Far 
line 28667=>over  the  plain Jowyn saw the glitter of their spears, as she stood  still, 
line 28668=>alone before the doors of the silent house. 
line 28669=> 
line 28670=>
line 28671=>####- 
line 28672=>
line 28673=>Chapter 7. Helm's Deep 
line 28674=>
line 28675=> 
line 28676=> 
line 28677=>     The sun was  already westering as they rode  from Edoras, and the light 
line 28678=>of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to a golden 
line 28679=>haze. There was  a beaten way,  north-westward  along the foot-hills  of the 
line 28680=>White Mountains,  and  this they  followed, up and  down in a green country, 
line 28681=>crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the 
line 28682=>Misty Mountains  loomed; ever darker  and taller they grew as the miles went 
line 28683=>by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind. 
line 28684=>     The  host rode on. Need drove them. Fearing to come too late, they rode 
line 28685=>with all the speed they  could, pausing seldom. Swift and  enduring were the 
line 28686=>steeds of Rohan, but there were many leagues to go. Forty  leagues  and more 
line 28687=>it was,  as  a bird flies, from Edoras to the fords of  the Isen, where they 
line 28688=>hoped to find the king's men that held back the hosts of Saruman. 
line 28689=>     Night closed about them. At last they  halted  to make their camp. They 
line 28690=>had ridden for some five hours and  were far out upon the western plain, yet  
line 28691=>more than half their journey lay still before them. In a great circle, under  
line 28692=>the starry sky and the waxing moon, they now made their bivouac. They lit no 
line 28693=>fires, for they  were  uncertain  of events; but they set a ring of  mounted 
line 28694=>guards about them, and  scouts  rode out far ahead, passing like shadows  in  
line 28695=>the folds  of  the land. The  slow night passed without tidings or alarm. At  
line 28696=>dawn the horns sounded, and within an hour they took the road again. 
line 28697=>     There were no clouds overhead yet,  but a  heaviness was in the air; it 
line 28698=>was hot for the season of the year. The rising sun was  hazy, and behind it, 
line 28699=>following it slowly up the sky, there was a growing darkness, as of a  great 
line 28700=>storm moving out of the East. And   away in the North-west there seemed to be 
line 28701=>another  darkness brooding about  the feet of the Misty Mountains,  a shadow 
line 28702=>that crept down slowly from the Wizard's Vale. 
line 28703=>     Gandalf dropped back to where Legolas rode beside Jomer.  'You have the 
line 28704=>keen  eyes  of  your fair  kindred, Legolas,' he said; 'and they  can tell  a  
line 28705=>sparrow from a finch a league off. Tell me, can you sec anything away yonder  
line 28706=>towards Isengard?' 
line 28707=>     'Many miles  lie between,' said Legolas, gazing thither and shading his 
line 28708=>eyes with his long hand. 'I can see a darkness. There  are shapes moving  in 
line 28709=>it,  great shapes  far away upon the bank of the river; but  what they are I 
line 28710=>
line 28711=>####-cannot tell. It  is  not  mist  or  cloud that defeats  my  eyes: there is a  
line 28712=>veiling shadow that  some power lays upon   the  land, and  it marches slowly 
line 28713=>down  stream.  It  is as  if the twilight under  endless trees were  flowing 
line 28714=>downwards from the hills.' 
line 28715=>     'And behind us comes a very storm of Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'It will be 
line 28716=>a black night.' 
line 28717=>     As  the second day  of their riding drew on, the  heaviness in the  air 
line 28718=>increased. In the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre 
line 28719=>canopy with great billowing  edges flecked with dazzling light. The sun went 
line 28720=>down, blood-red in a smoking haze. The spears of  the Riders were tipped with 
line 28721=>fire as  the  last shafts of light kindled the steep  faces  of the peaks of 
line 28722=>Thrihyrne: now very near they stood  on the  northernmost arm of  the  White 
line 28723=>Mountains, three jagged horns staring at  the  sunset. In the last red  glow 
line 28724=>men in the vanguard saw a black speck, a horseman  riding back towards them. 
line 28725=>They halted awaiting him. 
line 28726=>     He came, a  weary man  with dinted helm  and cloven shield.  Slowly  he 
line 28727=>climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping. At  length he spoke.  
line 28728=>'Is  Jomer  here?' he asked. 'You come at last, but too late,  and with  too 
line 28729=>little strength. Things have gone evilly since Thjodred fell. We were driven 
line 28730=>back yesterday over the Isen with great loss; many perished at the crossing. 
line 28731=>Then at  night fresh   forces  came  over  the river  against  our camp.  All 
line 28732=>Isengard  must  be  emptied;  and Saruman has  armed the  wild  hillmen  and 
line 28733=>herd-folk of Dunland beyond the rivers, and these also he loosed upon us. We 
line 28734=>were overmastered. The  shield-wall was  broken. Erkenbrand of  Westfold has 
line 28735=>drawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in Helm's Deep. The 
line 28736=>rest are scattered. 
line 28737=>     'Where is Jomer? Tell him there is no hope ahead.  He should  return to 
line 28738=>Edoras  before  the wolves of Isengard come there.' Thjoden  had sat silent, 
line 28739=>hidden from  the  man's sight behind his  guards; now  he  urged  his  horse 
line 28740=>forward. 'Come, stand before me, Ceorl!'  he said. 'I am here. The last host  
line 28741=>of the Eorlingas has ridden forth. It will not return without battle.' 
line 28742=>     The man's face lightened with joy and wonder.  He drew himself up. Then 
line 28743=>he knelt,  offering his  notched sword to the king. 'Command  me, lord!'  he 
line 28744=>cried. 'And pardon me! I thought--' 
line 28745=>     'You thought I remained  in Meduseld bent like an old tree under winter  
line 28746=>snow. So  it was  when you  rode  to war. But  a  west  wind has shaken  the  
line 28747=>boughs,' said Thjoden. 'Give this man a fresh horse! Let us ride to the help 
line 28748=>
line 28749=>####-of Erkenbrand!' 
line 28750=>     While Thjoden was speaking, Gandalf  rode a short way ahead, and he sat 
line 28751=>there  alone, gazing north  to Isengard and west to  the setting sun. Now he 
line 28752=>came back. 
line 28753=>     'Ride,  Thjoden!' he said. 'Ride to Helm's Deep! Go not to the Fords of 
line 28754=>Isen, and do not tarry in the plain! I must leave you for a while. Shadowfax 
line 28755=>must  bear me now on a swift errand.'  Turning to Aragorn and Jomer  and the 
line 28756=>men of the king's household, he cried: 'Keep well the Lord of the Mark, till 
line 28757=>I return. Await me at Helm's Gate! Farewell!' 
line 28758=>     He spoke a word to Shadowfax, and like an arrow  from the bow the gr eat 
line 28759=>horse sprang away. Even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the 
line 28760=>sunset, a wind over the  grass, a shadow that fled  and  passed  from sight. 
line 28761=>Snowmane  snorted and reared,  eager to follow; but only a swift bird on the 
line 28762=>wing could have overtaken him. 
line 28763=>     'What does that mean?' said one of the guard to Hbma. 
line 28764=>     'That Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste,' answered Hbma. 'Ever he goes 
line 28765=>and comes unlooked-for:' 
line 28766=>     'Wormtongue, were he here, would not find it hard to explain  'Said the 
line 28767=>other. 
line 28768=>     'True  enough,'  said Hbma; 'but for myself, I will  wait  until I  see 
line 28769=>Gandalf again.' 
line 28770=>     'Maybe you will wait long,' said the other. 
line 28771=>     The host turned away now from  the  road to the  Fords of Isen and bent 
line 28772=>their course southward. Night fell,  a nd still they rode on. The hills  drew 
line 28773=>near, but the tall peaks of Thrihyrne were already dim against the darkening 
line 28774=>sky.  Still  some miles away, on  the far side of the Westfold  Vale,  lay a  
line 28775=>green coomb, a great bay in  the mountains,  out of which  a gorge opened in  
line 28776=>the hills. Men of that land called it Helm's  Deep, after a hero of old wars 
line 28777=>who  had  made  his refuge there. Ever steeper and narrower it wound  inward 
line 28778=>from  the  north  under the shadow  of the Thrihyrne, till the  crow-haunted 
line 28779=>cliffs rose  like mighty towers on either side, shutting out the light. 
line 28780=>     At Helm's Gate, before the  mouth of the Deep, there was a heel of rock  
line 28781=>thrust outward by the northern cliff. There  upon its spur stood  high walls 
line 28782=>of  ancient stone, and within them was a lofty  tower. Men said that  in the 
line 28783=>far-off  days of  the glory  of  Gondor  the  sea -kings  had built here this 
line 28784=>fastness with the hands of giants. The Hornburg it was called, for a trumpet 
line 28785=>sounded  upon   the   tower  echoed  in  the  Deep  behind,  as   i f  armies 
line 28786=>
line 28787=>####-long-forgotten  were issuing to war from  caves beneath the  hills. A  wall, 
line 28788=>too,  the men  of old  had made  from the  Hornburg to  the  southern cliff,  
line 28789=>barring  the  entrance  to  the gorge.  Beneath  it by a  wide  culvert  the 
line 28790=>Deeping-stream passed out.  About the  feet  of  the Hornrock it wound,  and  
line 28791=>flowed  then in  a gully through the  midst of a wide  green  gore,  sloping 
line 28792=>gently  down  from  Helm's Gate  to  Helm's Dike.  Thence it  fell into  the 
line 28793=>Deeping-coomb and  out into  the Westfold  Vale.  There  in the  Hornburg at 
line 28794=>Helm's Gate Erkenbrand, master  of Westfold on the borders of the  Mark, now 
line 28795=>dwelt. As the days darkened with threat of war, being  wise, he had repaired 
line 28796=>the wall and made the fastness strong. 
line 28797=>     The Riders were still  in the low valley before the  mouth of the Coomb, 
line 28798=>when cries and  hornblasts were heard  from their scouts that went in front. 
line 28799=>Out of the  darkness arrows whistled. Swiftly a scout rode back and reported  
line 28800=>that wolf-riders were abroad in the valley, and tha t a host of Orcs and wild 
line 28801=>men were hurrying southward from the Fords of  Isen and seemed  to be 
line 28802=>making 
line 28803=>for Helm's Deep. 
line 28804=>     'We have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither,' said 
line 28805=>the scout. 'And we  have met scattered companies, going  this way  and that,  
line 28806=>leaderless. What has become of Erkenbrand  none seem to  know.  It is likely 
line 28807=>that  he  will be  overtaken  ere he can  reach Helm's Gate, if  he  has not 
line 28808=>already perished.' 
line 28809=>     'Has aught been seen of Gandalf?' asked Thjoden. 
line 28810=>     'Yes,   lord. Many have seen an old man in white upon a  horse,  passing 
line 28811=>hither and thither over the  plains like wind in  the grass. Some thought he 
line 28812=>was Saruman. It  is said  that he went away ere  nightfall towards Isengard. 
line 28813=>Some say also  that  Wormtongue was  seen  earlier,  going northward  with a 
line 28814=>company of Orcs.' 
line 28815=>     'It  will  go ill  with Wormtongue,  if  Gandalf  comes  upon  him said 
line 28816=>Thjoden.  'Nonetheless I miss now both my  counsellors, the old and the new.  
line 28817=>But in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as Gandalf said, to 
line 28818=>Helm's Gate, whether Erkenbrand be there or no. Is it known how great is the 
line 28819=>host that comes from the North?' 
line 28820=>     'It is very great,' said the scout. 'He  that flies counts every foeman 
line 28821=>twice, yet I have spoken  to stouthearted  men, and I do not doubt that  the 
line 28822=>main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here.' 
line 28823=>     'Then let us be swift,' said Jomer. 'Let us drive through such foes  as 
line 28824=>
line 28825=>####-are  already  between  us  and the  fastness. There are caves in Helm's Deep 
line 28826=>where hundreds may lie hid; and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills.  
line 28827=>     'Trust not to secret ways,' said the king. 'Saruman  has long spied out 
line 28828=>this land. Still in that place our defence may last long. Let us go!' 
line 28829=>     Aragorn and  Legolas went now with Jomer in the van. On through the dark 
line 28830=>night they rode, ever  slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed 
line 28831=>southward, higher and higher into the  dim folds about the  mountains' feet. 
line 28832=>They  found  few of the  enemy before  them. Here and  there they came  upon 
line 28833=>roving bands of Orcs; but they fled ere the Riders could take or slay them. 
line 28834=>     'It will not be long I fear,' said Jomer, 'ere the coming of the king's 
line 28835=>host will be known to the leader of our enemies, Saruman or whatever captain 
line 28836=>he has sent forth.' 
line 28837=>     The rumour of war grew behind them. Now they could hear, borne over the 
line 28838=>dark,  the  sound  of harsh  singing.  They  had  climbed far  up  into  the 
line 28839=>Deeping-coomb  when they looked back. Then they saw torches countless 
line 28840=>points 
line 28841=>of fiery light upon the  black fields behind, scattered like red flowers, or  
line 28842=>winding  up from  the lowlands in  long flickering lines.  Here and  there a  
line 28843=>larger blaze leapt up. 
line 28844=>     'It is a great host and follows us hard,' said Aragorn. 
line 28845=>     'They br ing fire,' said Thjoden,  'and they are  burning as  they come, 
line 28846=>rick, cot, and tree. This was  a rich vale and had many homesteads. Alas for  
line 28847=>my folk!' 
line 28848=>     'Would that day  was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm 
line 28849=>out of the mountains!' said Aragorn. 'It grieves me to fly before them.' 
line 28850=>     'We need not  fly much further,' said Jomer.  'Not  far ahead now  lies 
line 28851=>Helm's  Dike,  an  ancient trench  and rampart scored across the  coomb, two 
line 28852=>furlongs below Helm's Gate. There we can turn and give ba ttle.' 
line 28853=>     'Nay, we are too  few to defend the Dike,' said Thjoden. 'It  is a mile 
line 28854=>long or more, and the breach in it is wide.' 
line 28855=>     'At  the breach our  rearguard  must  stand,  if we  are pressed,' said 
line 28856=>Jomer. 
line 28857=>     There was neither star  nor moon when  the Riders came  to the breach in  
line 28858=>the Dike, where the stream from above passed out, and the road beside it ran 
line 28859=>down from  the  Hornburg. The  rampart loomed suddenly  before  them, a high 
line 28860=>shadow beyond a dark pit. As they rode up a sentinel challenged them. 
line 28861=>     'The Lord of the Mark rides  to Helm's Gate,' Jomer answered. 'I, Jomer  
line 28862=>
line 28863=>####-son of Jomund, speak.' 
line 28864=>     'This  is good  tidings beyond hope,' said  the  sentinel. 'Hasten! The 
line 28865=>enemy is on your heels.' 
line 28866=>     The host  passed  through the breach  and halted  on the sloping  sward 
line 28867=>above. They now learned to their joy  that Erkenbrand  had left  many men to 
line 28868=>hold Helm's Gate, and more had since escaped thither. 
line 28869=>     'Maybe, we have a thousand fit  to fight on foot,' said Gamling, an old 
line 28870=>man, the leader of those that watched the Dike. 'But  most of them have seen 
line 28871=>too many winters, as I have,  or too few, as my son's son here. What news of 
line 28872=>Erkenbrand? Word came yesterday that he was retreating hither with all  that 
line 28873=>is left of the best Riders of Westfold. But he has not come.' 
line 28874=>     'I fear that he will not come now,' said Jomer. 'Our scouts have gained 
line 28875=>no news of him, and the enemy fills all the valley behind us.' 
line 28876=>     'I would that he had  escaped,'  said Thjoden. 'He was a mighty man. In 
line 28877=>him lived again the  valour of Helm the Hammerhand.  But we cannot await 
line 28878=>him 
line 28879=>here. We must draw all our forces now behind the walls. Are you well stored?  
line 28880=>We bring  little  provision,  for we  rode forth  to open  battle,  not to a  
line 28881=>siege.' 
line 28882=>     'Behind us  in the caves  of the Deep  are  three  parts of the folk  of 
line 28883=>Westfold, old and young, children and women,' said Gamling. 'But great store 
line 28884=>of food, and many beasts and their fodder, have also been gathered there.' 
line 28885=>     'That is well,' said Jomer. 'They are burning or despoiling all that is 
line 28886=>left in the vale.' 
line 28887=>     'If they come to  bargain for our goods at Helm's Gate, they will pay a  
line 28888=>high price,' said Gamling. 
line 28889=>     The king and his Riders passed on. Before the causeway that crossed the  
line 28890=>stream they dismounted. In a long file they led their horses up the ramp and 
line 28891=>passed within the gates of the Hornburg. There they were welcomed again with 
line 28892=>joy and renewed hope; for now there were men enough to man both the burg 
line 28893=>and 
line 28894=>the barrier wall. 
line 28895=>     Quickly  Jomer set his  men in readiness. The king and  the men of  his 
line 28896=>household  were  in  the   Hornburg,  and  there  also  were   many  of  the  
line 28897=>Westfold-men.  But on  the Deeping  Wall and its tower, and behind it, Jomer  
line 28898=>arrayed most of  the strength that he had, for here the  defence seemed more 
line 28899=>doubtful, if the assault were determined and in great force. The horses were 
line 28900=>
line 28901=>####-led far up the Deep under such guard as could be spared. 
line 28902=>     The Deeping Wall was twenty feet high, and so thick that four men could  
line 28903=>walk abreast along the top, sheltered by a parapet  over  which  only a tall  
line 28904=>man could look. Here and there were clefts  in the  stone  through which men 
line 28905=>could shoot. This battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a 
line 28906=>door in the outer court of the Hornburg; three flights of steps led  also up 
line 28907=>on to the wall  from the Deep  behind; but in front  it  was smooth, and the 
line 28908=>great stones of it were set with such  skill that no foothold could be found 
line 28909=>at their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea -delved cliff.  
line 28910=>     Gimli  stood  leaning  against the breastwork upon the wall. Legolas sat 
line 28911=>above on the parapet, fingering his bow, and peering out into the gloom. 
line 28912=>     'This  is more to my liking,' said the dwarf, stamping  on  the stones.  
line 28913=>'Ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains. There is good rock here. 
line 28914=>This country has tough bones. I felt them in my feet as we came  up from the 
line 28915=>dike. Give  me  a year and a hundred of my kin and I would make this a place 
line 28916=>that armies would break upon like water.' 
line 28917=>     'I do not doubt  it,'  said Legolas.  'But you are a dwarf, and dwarves 
line 28918=>are strange folk. I do not like this  place, and I shall like it no more  by 
line 28919=>the light of  day.  But you  comfort me, Gimli, and I  am  glad  to have you  
line 28920=>standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe. I wish there were more 
line 28921=>of your kin among us. But even more would I give  for a hundred good archers 
line 28922=>of Mirkwood. We shall need  them.  The Rohirrim have good bowmen after 
line 28923=>their 
line 28924=>fashion, but there are too few here, too few.' 
line 28925=>     'It is dark for archery,'  said  Gimli. 'Indeed it is  time  for sleep. 
line 28926=>Sleep! I feel the need of it, as never  I thought any dwarf could. Riding is 
line 28927=>tiring  work. Yet my axe is restless in my hand. Give  me a row of orc-necks 
line 28928=>and room to swing and all weariness will fall from me!' 
line 28929=>     A  slow time  passed.  Far down  in  the valley  scattered  fires still 
line 28930=>burned. The hosts of Isengard were  advancing in  silence now. Their torches 
line 28931=>could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines.  
line 28932=>     Suddenly from the Dike yells  and screams,  and the fierce battle-cries 
line 28933=>of  men  broke  out. Flaming  brands  appeared over  the brink and clustered 
line 28934=>thickly at the  breach. Then they scattered and vanished. Men came galloping 
line 28935=>back  over the  field and  up the ramp to  the  gate of  the  Hornburg.  The 
line 28936=>rearguard of the Westfolders had been driven in. 
line 28937=>     'The enemy is at hand!' they said. 'We loosed every arrow  that we had, 
line 28938=>
line 28939=>####-and  filled the Dike with Orcs. But it will not halt them long. Already they 
line 28940=>are  scaling the bank at many  points,  thick as marching ants. But we  have 
line 28941=>taught them not to carry torches.' 
line 28942=>     It was  now past  midnight. The sky was utterly dark, and the stillness 
line 28943=>of the  heavy  air foreboded storm.  Suddenly  the  clouds were  seared by a  
line 28944=>blinding flash. Branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills. For a 
line 28945=>staring moment the watchers  on the walls saw all the space between them and 
line 28946=>the  Dike lit with white  light: it  was  boiling  and  crawling  with black  
line 28947=>shapes. some squat and broad, some  tall and grim, with high helms and sable 
line 28948=>shields. Hundreds and hundreds more  were pouring over the Dike and  through 
line 28949=>the breach.  The dark tide flowed  up to  the  walls  from  cliff  to cliff. 
line 28950=>Thunder rolled in the valley. Rain came lashing down. 
line 28951=>     Arrows thick  as the rain came whistling over the battlements, and fell 
line 28952=>clinking  and glancing on the stones. Some  found  a  mark.  The  assault on  
line 28953=>Helm's Deep  had  begun, but  no  sound  or challenge  was heard within;  no 
line 28954=>answering arrows came. 
line 28955=>     The  assailing  hosts halted, foiled  by the silent menace  of rock and 
line 28956=>wall. Ever and again  the lightning  tore aside the darkness.  Then the Orcs 
line 28957=>screamed, waving spear and sword, and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that 
line 28958=>stood  revealed upon the battlements;  and the men of the Mark amazed looked 
line 28959=>out,  as it seemed  to them, upon a great field of  dark corn, tossed  by  a  
line 28960=>tempest of war, and every ear glinted with barbed light. 
line 28961=>     Brazen trumpets sounded.  The enemy surged  forward,  some against  the 
line 28962=>Deeping Wall,  other  towards the causeway a nd  the ramp that led up to  the  
line 28963=>Hornburg-gates. There the hugest Orcs were mustered, and the wild men of the 
line 28964=>Dunland fells. A moment they hesitated and then  on they came. The lightning 
line 28965=>flashed,  and blazoned  upon  every helm  and  shield  the  ghastly  hand of 
line 28966=>Isengard was seen: They reached the summit of the  rock;  they drove towards 
line 28967=>the gates.  
line 28968=>     Then at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them,  and a hail of 
line 28969=>stones. They  wavered, broke, and fled  back; and  then charged again, broke 
line 28970=>and charged  again; and each time, like  the incoming sea, they  halted at a  
line 28971=>higher point. Again trumpets rang, and a press of roaring  men leaped forth.  
line 28972=>They held their great shields  above them like a roof, while in  their midst 
line 28973=>they  bore two trunks of  mighty  trees.  Behind  them orc-archers  crowded,  
line 28974=>sending a hail  of  darts against the bowmen on the walls. They  gained  the 
line 28975=>gates. The  trees, swung by  strong  arms, smote the timbers  with a rending 
line 28976=>
line 28977=>####-boom. If any man fell,  crushed by a stone hurtling  from above,  two others 
line 28978=>sprang to take his place. Again and again the great rams swung and crashed. 
line 28979=>     Jomer and Aragorn stood  together on  the Deeping Wall. They heard  the 
line 28980=>roar  of voices and the thudding of  the rams; and then in a sudden flash of 
line 28981=>light they beheld the peril of the gates.  
line 28982=>     'Come!' said Aragorn. 'This is the hour when we draw swords together!' 
line 28983=>     Running  like fire, they  sped along  the  wall, and up the  steps, and 
line 28984=>passed  into the  outer  court  upon the Rock.  As they  ran they gathered a  
line 28985=>handful of stout swordsmen. There was a small postern-door that opened in an 
line 28986=>angle of the burg-wall on the west, where the cliff  stretched  out to  meet 
line 28987=>it. On that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate, between the 
line 28988=>wall and the  sheer brink of  the Rock.  Together Jomer  and Aragorn  sprang 
line 28989=>through the door, their men close behind. The swords flashed from the sheath 
line 28990=>as one. 
line 28991=>     'G®thwinl!' cried Jomer. 'G®thwinl for the Mark!' 
line 28992=>     'And®ril!' cried Aragorn. 'And®ril for the D®nedain!' 
line 28993=>     Charging  from  the side,  they  hurled themselves  upon the  wild men. 
line 28994=>And®ril rose and fell,  gleaming with white fire. A shout went  up from wall 
line 28995=>and tower: 'And®ril! And®ril goes to  war. The Blade that  was Broken shines 
line 28996=>again!' 
line 28997=>     Dismayed  the  rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight;  but the 
line 28998=>wall of their shields  was broken as by  a  lightning-stroke, and  they were 
line 28999=>swept  away, hewn down,  or cast over the Rock into the stony stream  below.  
line 29000=>The orc-archers shot wildly and then fled. 
line 29001=>     For a moment Jomer and Aragorn halted before the gates. The thunder was 
line 29002=>rumbling in  the distance now.  The lightning flickered still, far off among 
line 29003=>the mountains  in the  South. A keen wind was blowing from  the North again. 
line 29004=>The clouds were torn and drifting, and stars peeped out; and above the hills 
line 29005=>of  the  Coomb-side  the  westering  moon  rode,  glimmering yellow  in  the 
line 29006=>storm-wrack. 
line 29007=>     'We  did not come too soon,' said Aragorn, looking  at the gates. Their 
line 29008=>great  hinges and  iron bars were  wrenched and bent; many  of their timbers 
line 29009=>were cracked. 
line 29010=>     'Yet we cannot stay here beyond  the walls to defend them,' said Jomer. 
line 29011=>'Look!'  He pointed to the causeway. Already a great press of Orcs  and  Men 
line 29012=>were  gathering again beyond the stream. Arrows whined, and  skipped on  the 
line 29013=>stones about  them. 'Come! We must get  back and see what we  can do to pile 
line 29014=>
line 29015=>####-stone and beam across the gates within. Come now!' 
line 29016=>     They  turned  and ran. At  that  moment some dozen Orcs that  had  lain 
line 29017=>motionless among  the slain  leaped  to their feet,  and  came  silently and 
line 29018=>swiftly behind. Two flung themselves to the ground at Jomer's heels, tripped 
line 29019=>him,  and in a moment they were on top of him. But a  small dark figure that 
line 29020=>none had observed sprang out of the shadows  and gave a hoarse  shout: Baruk 
line 29021=>Khazvd! Khazvd ai-mknu! An axe swung and swept back. Two Orcs fell 
line 29022=>headless.  
line 29023=>The rest fled. 
line 29024=>     Jomer struggled to his feet, even as Aragorn ran back to his aid. 
line 29025=>     The postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside 
line 29026=>with  stones. When all  were safe  within, Jomer turned: 'I thank you, Gimli 
line 29027=>son of Gluin!' he said. 'I did not know that you were with us in the sortie. 
line 29028=>But oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. How came you there?' 
line 29029=>     'I followed you to shake off sleep,'  said Gimli; 'but I looked on  the 
line 29030=>hillmen  and they seemed over large for me, so  I sat  beside a stone to see 
line 29031=>your sword-play.' 
line 29032=>     'I shall not find it easy to repay you,' said Jomer. 
line 29033=>     'There may be many a chance ere the night is over,' laughed the  Dwarf.  
line 29034=>'But I am content. Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria.' 
line 29035=>     'Two!' said Gimli, patting his axe. He had returned to his place on the 
line 29036=>wall. 
line 29037=>     'Two?' said Legolas. 'I have done  better, though  now I must grope for  
line 29038=>spent arrows; all mine are gone. Yet I make my tale twenty at the least. But 
line 29039=>that is only a few leaves in a forest.' 
line 29040=>     The  sky  now  was  quickly clearing and the sinking  moon was  shining  
line 29041=>brightly. But the light brought little hope to  the Riders  of the Mark. The 
line 29042=>enemy before them seemed to  have  grown rather than diminished,  still more 
line 29043=>were  pressing up from  the valley through  the breach. The sortie  upon the 
line 29044=>Rock gained  only a  brief respite. The  assault on the gates was redoubled. 
line 29045=>Against the Deeping Wall the hosts of Isengard roared like a  sea.  Orcs and 
line 29046=>hillmen swarmed about  its feet from end  to end. Ropes with grappling hooks 
line 29047=>were hurled over the  parapet faster  than men could cut them  or fling them 
line 29048=>back.  Hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. Many were cast down in ruin, 
line 29049=>but many more replaced  them, and Orcs sprang up them like  apes in the dark 
line 29050=>forests of the South. Before the wall's foot  the dead and broken were piled 
line 29051=>like shingle in  a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the  
line 29052=>
line 29053=>####-enemy came on. 
line 29054=>     The men of Rohan grew weary.  All their arrows  were  spent, and  every 
line 29055=>shaft  was shot;  their swords were notched, and their shields  were  riven. 
line 29056=>Three  times Aragorn and Jomer  rallied them, and three times And®ril flamed 
line 29057=>in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall. 
line 29058=>     Then  a  clamour arose  in the Deep  behind. Orcs had crept  like  rats 
line 29059=>through the culvert  through  which the stream  flowed out. There  they  had 
line 29060=>gathered in the  shadow of the cliffs, until  the assault  above was hottest  
line 29061=>and  nearly all  the men of the defence had rushed to  the  wall's top. Then 
line 29062=>they sprang out. Already some had passed into the jaws of  the Deep and were 
line 29063=>among the horses, fighting with the guards.  
line 29064=>     Down from  the wall leapt Gimli with a fierce  cry  that echoed in  the 
line 29065=>cliffs.  'Khazvd! Khazvd!' He soon had work enough. 
line 29066=>     'Ai -oi!'  he  shouted.  'The  Orcs are  behind  the  wall. Ai -oi! Come, 
line 29067=>Legolas! There are enough for us both. Khazvd ai-mknu!' 
line 29068=>     Gamling the Old looked down  from the Hornburg, hearing the great voice 
line 29069=>of the  dwarf above all the  tumult.  'The Orcs are in  the Deep!' he cried. 
line 29070=>'Helm! Helm!  Forth Helmingas. he shouted as he leaped  down the  stair from 
line 29071=>the Rock with many men of Westfold at his back. 
line 29072=>     Their  onset was fierce and sudden, and the Orcs gave way before  them.  
line 29073=>Ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain 
line 29074=>or driven shrieking into the chasm of the Deep to fall before the  guardians 
line 29075=>of the hidden caves. 
line 29076=>     'Twenty-one!'  cried  Gimli. He  hewed a two -handed stroke and laid the 
line 29077=>last Orc before his feet. 'Now my count passes Master Legolas again.' 
line 29078=>     'We must stop this rat-hole,' said Gamling.  'Dwarves  are  said  to be 
line 29079=>cunning folk with stone. Lend us your aid, master!' 
line 29080=>     'We do  not shape stone with battle-axes,  nor with our  finger -nails,' 
line 29081=>said Gimli. 'But I will help as I may.' 
line 29082=>     They  gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find  
line 29083=>to hand, and under  Gimli's direction  the Westfold-men blocked up the inner 
line 29084=>end  of  the  culvert,  until  only  a  narrow  outlet  remained.  Then  the 
line 29085=>Deeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and fretted in its choked path,  
line 29086=>and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff. 
line 29087=>     'It will  be drier above,' said  Gimli. 'Come, Gamling, let us see  how 
line 29088=>things go on the wall!' 
line 29089=>     He  climbed up and  found Legolas beside Aragorn and Jomer. The elf was 
line 29090=>
line 29091=>####-whetting his long knife. There was  for a while a lull in the assault, since 
line 29092=>the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled. 
line 29093=>     'Twenty-one!' said Gimli. 
line 29094=>     'Good!' said  Legolas.  'But my count  is  now  two  dozen. It has been 
line 29095=>knife-work up here.' 
line 29096=>     Jomer  and Aragorn  leant wearily on their swo rds. Away on the left the 
line 29097=>crash  and  clamour  of the battle  on the Rock rose  loud  again.  But  the 
line 29098=>Hornburg still held fast, like an island in the sea.  Its gates lay in ruin; 
line 29099=>but over  the  barricade of  beams and  stones  within no  enemy  as yet had 
line 29100=>passed. 
line 29101=>     Aragorn  looked at the pale stars, and  at the moon, now sloping behind 
line 29102=>the  western  hills that enclosed  the valley. 'This is a  night  as long as 
line 29103=>years,' he said. 'How long will the day tarry?' 
line 29104=>     'Dawn is not far off,' said Gamling, who had now climbed up beside him. 
line 29105=>'But dawn will not help us, I fear.' 
line 29106=>     'Yet dawn is ever the hope of men,' said Aragorn. 
line 29107=>     'But these creatures of  Isengard, these half-orcs and  goblin-men that 
line 29108=>the foul craft of Saruman  has bred, they will not quail at the  sun,'  said 
line 29109=>Gamling. 'And neither will  the wild men of the hills. Do you not hear their 
line 29110=>voices?' 
line 29111=>     'I  hear them,' said  Jomer; 'but they are only the scream of birds and 
line 29112=>the bellowing of beasts to my ears.' 
line 29113=>     'Yet  there  are many that cry in the Dunland tongue,' said Gamling. 'I  
line 29114=>know that tongue.  It is an ancient speech  of men, and  once  was spoken in  
line 29115=>many western valleys of the Mark. Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for 
line 29116=>our doom seems certain to them. 'The king the king!' they cry. 'We will take 
line 29117=>their king.  Death to the Forgoil!  Death  to the Strawheads! Death  to  the  
line 29118=>robbers of the North!'  Such names they have for  us. Not in half a thousand 
line 29119=>years have they forgotten their  grievance that the lords of Gondor gave the 
line 29120=>Mark to  Eorl the  Young and  made alliance with him. That old hatred Saruman 
line 29121=>has  inflamed. They are fierce folk when roused. They  will not give way now 
line 29122=>for dusk or dawn, until Thjoden is taken, or they themselves are slain.' 
line 29123=>     'Nonetheless day will bring hope to me,' said Aragorn.  'Is it not said 
line 29124=>that no foe has ever taken the Hornburg, if men defended it?' 
line 29125=>     'So the minstrels say,' said Jomer. 
line 29126=>     'Then let us defend it, and hope!' said Aragorn. 
line 29127=>     Even as they  spoke there came a blare  of trumpets. Then there  was  a  
line 29128=>
line 29129=>####-crash  and a flash of  flame and  smoke. The waters  of  the  Deeping-stream 
line 29130=>poured out  hissing and  foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping  hole 
line 29131=>was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in. 
line 29132=>     'Devilry of Saruman! ' cried  Aragorn.  'They have crept  in the culvert 
line 29133=>again, while  we talked, and  they have  lit the fire of Orthanc beneath our 
line 29134=>feet. Elendil, Elendil!' he shouted, as he leaped down into  the breach; but 
line 29135=>even as he  did  so  a hundred ladders were raised  against the  battlements.  
line 29136=>Over the wall and under  the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark 
line 29137=>wave upon a hill of  sand. The  defence  was  swept away. Some of the Riders 
line 29138=>were driven back, further and further into the Deep, falling and fighting a s 
line 29139=>they gave way, step  by step, towards the caves.  Others cut  their way back  
line 29140=>towards the citadel. 
line 29141=>     A  broad  stairway,  climbed  from  the Deep  up  to the  Rock and  the 
line 29142=>rear-gate of the Hornburg. Near the bottom stood  Aragorn. In his hand still 
line 29143=>And®ril gleamed,  and  the terror of  the sword  for a while  held  back the 
line 29144=>enemy,  as one by one all who  could  gain the  stair passed up  towards the 
line 29145=>gate. Behind  on the upper  steps knelt Legolas. His bow  was  bent, but one  
line 29146=>gleaned arrow  was all that he had left,  and he  peered out now,  ready  to 
line 29147=>shoot the first Orc that should dare to approach the stair. 
line 29148=>     'All  who  can  have now got safe  within, Aragorn,' he  called.  'Come 
line 29149=>back!' 
line 29150=>     Aragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as  he ran he stumbled in his 
line 29151=>weariness. At once  his  enemies  leapt forward. Up  came the Orcs, yelling,  
line 29152=>with  their  long arms stretched out to  seize  him. The foremost  fell with 
line 29153=>Legolas' last  arrow in his  throat. but the rest sprang  over  him.  Then a  
line 29154=>great boulder, cast from the outer wall above,  crashed down upon the stair, 
line 29155=>and hurled them back into the Deep.  Aragorn gained the door, and swiftly it 
line 29156=>clanged to behind him. 
line 29157=>     'Things go ill,  my friends,'  he said, wiping the sweat  from his brow 
line 29158=>with his arm. 
line 29159=>     'Ill enough,' said Legolas,  'but not yet hopeless, while  we have  you  
line 29160=>with us. Where is Gimli?' 
line 29161=>     'I do not  know.' said Aragorn. 'I last saw  him fighting on the ground 
line 29162=>behind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.' 
line 29163=>     'Alas! That is evil news,' said Legolas. 
line 29164=>     'He is  stout and strong,'  said Aragorn. 'Let  us  hope  that he  will 
line 29165=>escape back to the caves. There he would be safe for a while. Safer than we. 
line 29166=>
line 29167=>####-Such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.' 
line 29168=>     'That must be my hope'' said Legolas. 'But I wish that he had come this 
line 29169=>way. I desired to tell Master Gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine.' 
line 29170=>     'If he wins back to the caves, he will pass your  count again,' laughed 
line 29171=>Aragorn. 'Never did I see an axe so wielded.' 
line 29172=>     'I must go  a nd seek some arrows,' said Legolas. 'Would that this night 
line 29173=>would end, and I could have better light for shooting.' 
line 29174=>     Aragorn  now  passed into the  citadel. There to his  dismay he learned 
line 29175=>that Jomer had not reached the Hornburg. 
line 29176=>     'Nay,  he did not come to the Rock,'  said one  of the Westfold-men,  'I 
line 29177=>last saw him gathering men about him and fighting  in the mouth of the Deep. 
line 29178=>Gamling was with him, and the dwarf; but I could not come to them.' 
line 29179=>     Aragorn strode  on  through  the  inner court,  and  mounted to a  high 
line 29180=>chamber in  the tower. There stood  the king, dark  against a narrow window, 
line 29181=>looking out upon the vale. 
line 29182=>     'What is the news, Aragorn?' he said. 
line 29183=>     'The Deeping Wall is taken, lord, and  all the  defence swept away; but 
line 29184=>many have escaped hither to the Rock.' 
line 29185=>     'Is Jomer here?' 
line 29186=>     'No, lord. But many  of your men  retreated into the Deep; and some say 
line 29187=>that Jomer was amongst them. In the narrows they may hold back the enemy 
line 29188=>and 
line 29189=>come within the caves. What hope they may have then I  do not know.' 
line 29190=>     'More than we.  Good  provision,  it is said. And  the air is wholesome 
line 29191=>there because of  the outlets through fissures  in the rock  far above. None 
line 29192=>can force an entrance against determined men. They may hold out long.' 
line 29193=>     'But the Orcs have brought a devilry from Orthanc,' said Aragorn. 'They 
line 29194=>have a blasting fire, and with it they took the Wall. If they cannot come in 
line 29195=>the caves, they may seal up those that are inside.  But now we must turn all 
line 29196=>our thoughts to our own defence.' 
line 29197=>     'I fret in this prison,'  said Thjoden. 'If I could have set a spear in 
line 29198=>rest, riding before my men upon the field, maybe I could have felt again the  
line 29199=>joy of battle, and so ended. But I serve little purpose here.' 
line 29200=>     'Here at least you are guarded in the  strongest fastness of the Mark,' 
line 29201=>said Aragorn.  'More  hope we  have to defend you  in  the Hornburg than  in 
line 29202=>Edoras, or even at Dunharrow in the mountains.' 
line 29203=>     'It  is said  that the Hornburg  has  never  fallen  to  assault,' said 
line 29204=>
line 29205=>####-Thjoden; 'but now my heart is doubtful. The world changes, and all that once 
line 29206=>was strong now proves unsure. How shall any tower withstand such numbers 
line 29207=>and 
line 29208=>such reckless  hate? Had I known that the strength  of Isengard was grown so 
line 29209=>great, maybe  l should  not so rashly have ridden forth to  meet it, for all 
line 29210=>the arts of Gandalf. His counsel  seems  not now so good as it did under the 
line 29211=>morning sun.' 
line 29212=>     'Do not judge  the counsel  of  Gandalf, until all is over, lord,' said 
line 29213=>Aragorn. 
line 29214=>     'The  end will not be  long,'  said the king. 'But I will not end here, 
line 29215=>taken like an old badger  in a trap. Snowmane and Hasufel  and the horses of 
line 29216=>my guard are  in the inner court.  When  dawn comes, I  will bid  men  sound 
line 29217=>Helm's horn,  and I  will ride forth.  Will  you ride  with me then, son  of 
line 29218=>Arathorn? Maybe we shall cleave a road, or make such an end as will be worth 
line 29219=>a song-if any be left to sing of us hereafter.' 
line 29220=>     'I will ride with you,' said Aragorn. 
line 29221=>     Taking  his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their 
line 29222=>circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot.  
line 29223=>Legolas  went with  him.  Blasts of  fire leaped up from  below  shaking the 
line 29224=>stones. Grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. Again and again the 
line 29225=>Orcs gained the  summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them 
line 29226=>down. 
line 29227=>     At last Aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless  of the darts  of 
line 29228=>the  enemy. As  he  looked forth he  saw the eastern sky grow  pale. Then he 
line 29229=>raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley. 
line 29230=>     The Orcs yelled and jeered. 'Come down! Come down!' they cried. 'If you 
line 29231=>wish  to speak  to us, come down! Bring out your  king!  We are the fighting 
line 29232=>Uruk-hai.  We will fetch him from his hole,  if  he does not come. Bring out 
line 29233=>your skulking king!' 
line 29234=>     'The king stays or comes at his own will,' said Aragorn. 
line 29235=>     'Then what are you doing here?' they answered. 'Why do you look out? Do 
line 29236=>you wish to see the greatness of our army? We are the fighting Uruk-hai.' 
line 29237=>     'I looked out to see the dawn,' said Aragorn. 
line 29238=>     'What of the dawn?' they jeered. 'We are the Uruk-hai:  we  do not stop  
line 29239=>the fight for night or day, for fair  weather or for storm. We come to kill, 
line 29240=>by sun or moon. What of the dawn?' 
line 29241=>     'None knows what the  new day shall bring him,' said  Aragorn. 'Get you  
line 29242=>
line 29243=>####-gone, ere it turn to your evil.' 
line 29244=>     'Get down or  we will shoot you from the wall,' they cried. 'This is no 
line 29245=>parley. You have nothing to say.' 
line 29246=>     'I have still this to say,' answered Aragorn. 'No  enemy has  yet taken 
line 29247=>the Hornburg. Depart, or not one of you will be spared. Not one will be left 
line 29248=>alive to take back tidings to the North. You do not know your peril.' 
line 29249=>     So great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragorn, as he stood there 
line 29250=>alone  above the ruined gates before  the host of  his  enemies, that many of 
line 29251=>the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and  
line 29252=>some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Orcs laughed with loud voices; 
line 29253=>and a  hail of darts and arrows whistled over  the  wall, as  Aragorn leaped 
line 29254=>down. 
line 29255=>     There  was a roar and a blast of  fire. The archway  of the gate  above 
line 29256=>which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed  in smoke  and 
line 29257=>dust. 
line 29258=>The  barricade was  scattered as if  by  a thunderbolt. Aragorn  ran to  the 
line 29259=>king's tower. 
line 29260=>     But even as the gate fell, and the Orcs  about it yelled,  preparing to 
line 29261=>charge, a murmur arose behind them. like a wind in the distance, and it grew 
line 29262=>to a clamour of many voices crying strange news  in the dawn.  The Orcs upon 
line 29263=>the Rock, hearing the  rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back.  And then, 
line 29264=>sudden and terrible, from the  tower above, the sound  of the great horn  of 
line 29265=>Helm rang out. 
line 29266=>     All that heard that sound trembled. Many of the Orcs cast themselves on 
line 29267=>their faces and covered their ears  with their claws. Back from the Deep the 
line 29268=>echoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald 
line 29269=>stood. But on the walls men looked up, listening with wonder; for the echoes 
line 29270=>did not die. Ever the  horn-blasts wound on among the hills; nearer now  and  
line 29271=>louder they answered one to another, blowing fierce and free. 
line 29272=>     'Helm!  Helm!' the Riders  shouted.  'Helm is arisen  and comes back to 
line 29273=>war. Helm for Thjoden King!' 
line 29274=>     And with that shout the king came. His horse  was white as snow, golden 
line 29275=>was  his shield,  and his  spear was long. At his  right  hand  was Aragorn, 
line 29276=>Elendil's  heir, behind him rode the lords of the  House of Eorl the  Young. 
line 29277=>Light sprang in the sky. Night departed. 
line 29278=>     'Forth Eorlingas!' With a cry and a great noise they charged. Down from 
line 29279=>the gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove  through 
line 29280=>
line 29281=>####-the hosts of Isengard as a wind among grass. Behind them  from the Deep came 
line 29282=>the stern cries of' men issuing from the caves, driving forth the enemy. Out 
line 29283=>poured  all the men that were left upon  the Rock.  And  ever the  sound  of 
line 29284=>blowing horns echoed in the hills.  
line 29285=>     On they rode, the king and his companions. Captains  and champions fell  
line 29286=>or fled before them. Neither orc nor man withstood them. Their backs were to 
line 29287=>the swords  and  spears of the Riders and their  faces to  the  valley. They 
line 29288=>cried  and  wailed,  for fear and great wonder had  come upon  them with the  
line 29289=>rising of the day. 
line 29290=>     So King Thjoden rode from Helm's Gate and clove his path to  the  great 
line 29291=>Dike. There the company  halted. Light grew bright about them. Shafts of the 
line 29292=>sun flared above the  eastern hills and  glimmered on their spears. But they 
line 29293=>sat silent on their horses, and they gazed down upon the Deeping-coomb. 
line 29294=>     The land had changed. Where before the green dale had  lain, its grassy 
line 29295=>slopes lapping  the ever -mounting hills,  there  now a forest  loomed. Great 
line 29296=>trees, bare and  silent,  stood, rank on  rank, with tangled bough and hoary 
line 29297=>head;  their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass. Darkness was 
line 29298=>under them. Between the  Dike and the eaves of that  nameless wood only  two 
line 29299=>open furlongs lay.  There now cowered  the proud hosts of Saruman, in terror 
line 29300=>of the  king and in terror of the trees. They streamed down from Helm's Gate 
line 29301=>until all above the Dike was  empty  of them, but below it they were  packed 
line 29302=>like swarming flies.  Vainly they crawled and clambered about  the walls  of 
line 29303=>the coomb. seeking to escape.  Upon the  east  too sheer and stony  was  the 
line 29304=>valley's side; upon the left, from the west, their final doom approached. 
line 29305=>     There suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in 
line 29306=>the rising  sun.  Over  the low hills  the horns were  sounding. Behind him, 
line 29307=>hastening down the long slopes,  were a  thousand  men on foot; their swords 
line 29308=>were in their hands. Amid them strode a man tall and strong.  His shield was 
line 29309=>red. As he came to the valley's brink, he set to his lips a great black horn 
line 29310=>and blew a ringing blast. 
line 29311=>     'Erkenbrand!' the Riders shouted. 'Erkenbrand!' 
line 29312=>     'Behold the White Rider!' cried Aragorn. 'Gandalf is come again!' 
line 29313=>     'Mithrandir, Mithrandir!' said Legolas. 'This is wizardry indeed! Come!  
line 29314=>I would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.' 
line 29315=>     The  hosts  of Isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from 
line 29316=>fear to fear. Again the horn sounded from the tower. Down through the breach 
line 29317=>of  the  Dike  charged  the  king's  company.  Down  from  the hills  leaped 
line 29318=>
line 29319=>####-Erkenbrand, lord  of Westfold. Down leaped Shadowfax, like a  deer that runs 
line 29320=>surefooted  in  the mountains. The White Rider was upon them, and the terror  
line 29321=>of  his coming filled  the enemy with  madness. The  wild men fell on  their 
line 29322=>faces before him. The Orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and 
line 29323=>spear. Like  a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. Wailing they 
line 29324=>passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever  
line 29325=>came again. 
line 29326=> 
line 29327=>
line 29328=>####- 
line 29329=>
line 29330=>Chapter 8. The Road to Isengard 
line 29331=>
line 29332=> 
line 29333=> 
line 29334=>     So it was that in the  light of a fair morning King Thjoden and Gandalf 
line 29335=>the White Rider met again  upon the green  grass beside the  Deeping -stream. 
line 29336=>There was also Aragorn son of Arathorn, and Legolas  the Elf, and Erkenbrand 
line 29337=>of Westfold, and the lords of the Golden House. About them were gathered the 
line 29338=>Rohirrim, the Riders of  the Mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and 
line 29339=>their eyes were turned towards the wood. 
line 29340=>     Suddenly there was a great shout, and down from the Dike came those who 
line 29341=>had been driven back into the  Deep. There came  Gamling  the Old, and Jomer  
line 29342=>son of Jomund, and  beside them walked Gimli the dwarf. He had  no helm, 
line 29343=>and 
line 29344=>about his head was a linen band stained  with blood; but his voice  was loud 
line 29345=>and strong. 
line 29346=>     'Forty-two,  Master Legolas!' he cried. 'Alas! My  axe is  notched: the 
line 29347=>forty-second had an iron collar on his neck. How is it with you?' 
line 29348=>     'You have passed my  score  by  one,' answered Legolas. 'But  I  do not  
line 29349=>grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs!' 
line 29350=>     'Welcome, Jomer, sister -son!' said Thjoden. 'Now that I see you safe, I 
line 29351=>am glad indeed.' 
line 29352=>     'Hail, Lord  of the Mark!' said Jomer. 'The dark night has  passed  and 
line 29353=>day has come again. But  the day has brought strange tidings.' He turned and 
line 29354=>gazed in wonder, first at the  wood and then at Gandalf. 'Once more you come 
line 29355=>in the hour of need, unlooked-for,' he said. 
line 29356=>     'Unlooked-for?' said Gandalf. 'I said that I would return and  meet you  
line 29357=>here.' 
line 29358=>     'But you did not name the hour, nor foretell the manner of your coming. 
line 29359=>Strange help you bring. You are mighty in wizardry, Gandalf the White!' 
line 29360=>     'That may be. But if so, I have not shown it yet. I have but given good 
line 29361=>counsel in peril, and made  use of the  speed of Shadowfax. Your  own valour 
line 29362=>has done more, and  the stout legs of the Westfold-men  marching through the 
line 29363=>night.' 
line 29364=>     Then  they all gazed  at Gandalf with still greater wonder. Some glanced 
line 29365=>darkly  at the wood,  and  passed their  hands  over their brows, as if they 
line 29366=>thought their eyes saw otherwise than his.  
line 29367=>
line 29368=>####-     Gandalf laughed long and merrily. 'The trees?' he said. 'Nay, I see the 
line 29369=>wood as plainly as do you. But that is no deed of mine. It is a thing beyond 
line 29370=>the counsel of the wise. Better than my design, and better even than my hope 
line 29371=>the event has proved.' 
line 29372=>     'Then  if  not  yours,  whose  is  the  wizardry?'  said Thjoden.   'Not 
line 29373=>Saruman's, that is plain. Is there some mightier sage, of  whom  we have yet 
line 29374=>to learn?' 
line 29375=>     'It is  not  wizardry, but a power far older,' said  Gandalf:  'a power  
line 29376=>that walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang. 
line 29377=>     Ere iron was found or tree was hewn, 
line 29378=>     When young was mountain under moon; 
line 29379=>     Ere ring was made, or wrought was woe, 
line 29380=>     It walked the forests long ago.' 
line 29381=>     'And what may be the answer to your riddle?' said Thjoden. 
line 29382=>     'If you  would  learn  that,  you  should come  with me  to  Isengard ' 
line 29383=>answered Gandalf.  
line 29384=>     'To Isengard?' they cried. 
line 29385=>     'Yes,'  said Gandalf. 'I shall  return to  Isengard, and those who will 
line 29386=>may come with me. There we may see strange things.' 
line 29387=>     'But  there  are  not men  enough  in  the Mark,  not if  they were all 
line 29388=>gathered  together and  healed  of  wounds  and  weariness, to  assault  the 
line 29389=>stronghold of Saruman,' said Thjoden. 
line 29390=>     'Nevertheless  to Isengard I go,' said Gandalf. 'I shall not stay there 
line 29391=>long. My way lies now eastward. Look for me in Edoras, ere the waning of the 
line 29392=>moon!' 
line 29393=>     'Nay!' said Thjoden.  'In  the dark hour  before dawn I doubted, but we 
line 29394=>will not part now. I will come with you, if that is your counsel.' 
line 29395=>     'I  wish to speak with Saruman, as soon as may be  now,' said  Gandalf, 
line 29396=>'and since he  has done you  great injury, it  would  be fitting if you were 
line 29397=>there. But how soon and how swiftly will you ride?' 
line 29398=>     'My  men  are weary with battle,' said the King; 'and  I am weary also. 
line 29399=>For I have ridden far and slept little. Alas! My  old age is not feigned nor  
line 29400=>due only to the  whisperings  of  Wormtongue. It is an ill that no leech can 
line 29401=>wholly cure, not even Gandalf.' 
line 29402=>     'Then let all who are to ride with me rest now,' said Gandalf. 'We will 
line 29403=>journey under the shadow of evening. It is  as well;  for  it is my  counsel 
line 29404=>that all our comings and goings should be as  secret as may  be, henceforth. 
line 29405=>
line 29406=>####-But do not command many  men to go with you, Thjoden. We go to  a parley 
line 29407=>not 
line 29408=>to a fight.' 
line 29409=>     The King then chose  men that  were unhurt and had swift horses, and he 
line 29410=>sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the Mark; and 
line 29411=>they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste 
line 29412=>to Edoras. There the Lord of the Mark  would  hold an  assembly  of all that 
line 29413=>could bear arms, on the second day after the full moon. To  ride with him to  
line 29414=>Isengard the King chose Jomer and twenty men of his household. With  
line 29415=>Gandalf 
line 29416=>would go  Aragorn, and Legolas, and Gimli. In spite  of his hurt  the  dwarf 
line 29417=>would not stay behind. 
line 29418=>     'It  was only a  feeble blow and the cap turned it;' he said. 'It would 
line 29419=>take more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.' 
line 29420=>     'I will tend it, while you rest,' said Aragorn. 
line 29421=>     The king now returned to the Hornburg, and slept, such a sleep of quie t 
line 29422=>as he had not known for many years,  and the remainder of his chosen company 
line 29423=>rested also. But the others, all that  were not  hurt  or wounded,  began  a  
line 29424=>great labour; for many had fallen  in the battle and lay dead upon the field 
line 29425=>or in the Deep. 
line 29426=>     No  Orcs remained alive; their bodies were uncounted. But  a great many 
line 29427=>of the hillmen had given themselves up; and they were afraid,  and cried for  
line 29428=>mercy. 
line 29429=>     The Men of the Mark took their weapons from them, and set them to work. 
line 29430=>     'Help  now  to  repa ir  the  evil  in  which  you  have  joined,'  said 
line 29431=>Erkenbrand;  'and afterwards you  shall take an oath never again to pass the 
line 29432=>Fords of Isen in arms, nor to march  with the  enemies of Men;  and then you 
line 29433=>shall go free back to your land. For you have been deluded  by Saruman. Many 
line 29434=>of  you  have got  death  as  the  reward  of your trust in him; but had you  
line 29435=>conquered, little better would your wages have been.' 
line 29436=>     The men of Dunland were amazed, for Saruman had told  them that the men 
line 29437=>of Rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive. 
line 29438=>     In the  midst of  the field before the Hornburg two mounds were raised, 
line 29439=>and  beneath them  were laid  all  the Riders of the Mark who  fell  in  the 
line 29440=>defence, those of the  East Dales upon one side, and  those of Westfold upon  
line 29441=>the  other. In a_ grave alone  under the shadow  of  the Hornburg  lay Hbma, 
line 29442=>captain of the King's guard. He fell before the Gate. 
line 29443=>
line 29444=>####-     The Orcs  were piled in great heaps, away  from the mounds  of Men, not 
line 29445=>far  from  the eaves of the forest. And the people  were  troubled in  their 
line 29446=>minds; for the  heaps of carrion were too great  for burial or for  burning. 
line 29447=>They had little wood for firing, and none would have dared to take an axe to 
line 29448=>the strange trees, even if Gandalf had not warned them to hurt  neither bark 
line 29449=>nor bough at their great peril. 
line 29450=>     'Let the Orcs lie,' said Gandalf. 'The morning may bring new counsel.' 
line 29451=>     In  the  afternoon the King's company prepared  to depart.  The work of 
line 29452=>burial was then but beginning; and Thjoden mourned for the loss of Hbma, his 
line 29453=>captain,  and cast the first earth upon  his grave. 'Great injury indeed has 
line 29454=>Saruman  done  to me and all  this land,' he said; 'and  I will remember it, 
line 29455=>when we meet.' 
line 29456=>     The sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west  of the Coomb,  
line 29457=>when  at last  Thjoden and Gandalf and their companions  rode down from  the 
line 29458=>Dike. Behind them were gathered a great host,  both of the Riders and of the 
line 29459=>people of Westfold, old and young, women and children, who had come out 
line 29460=>from 
line 29461=>the caves. A song of victory they sang with clear voices; and then they fell 
line 29462=>silent, wondering what would chance,  for their  eyes were on the trees  and 
line 29463=>they feared them. 
line 29464=>     The Riders came to the wood, and they halted; horse and  man, they were 
line 29465=>unwilling  to  pass in. T he trees were grey and menacing, and a shadow  or a  
line 29466=>mist  was about them. The ends of their long  sweeping boughs hung down like 
line 29467=>searching  fingers, their roots  stood up from the ground like the  limbs of 
line 29468=>strange monsters,  and  dark  caverns opened benea th them.  But Gandalf went 
line 29469=>forward, leading the company, and where the road from  the Hornburg  met the 
line 29470=>trees they saw now an opening like an arched gate  under mighty  boughs; and 
line 29471=>through  it  Gandalf passed,  and they followed him. Then to their amazement 
line 29472=>they  found that the road ran on, and the Deeping-stream  beside it; and the 
line 29473=>sky was open above  and  full of golden light. But on either side the  great 
line 29474=>aisles  of the  wood  were  already  wrapped in  dusk,  stretching away into 
line 29475=>impenetrable shadows; and there  they  heard the  creaking  and  groaning of  
line 29476=>boughs, and far cries, and a rumour of  wordless  voices, murmuring angrily.  
line 29477=>No Orc or other living creature could be seen. 
line 29478=>     Legolas  and  Gimli were now riding  together  upon one horse; and they  
line 29479=>kept close beside Gandalf, for Gimli was afraid of the wood. 
line 29480=>     'It is hot in  here,'  said Legolas  to Gandalf. 'I feel  a great wrath 
line 29481=>
line 29482=>####-about me. Do you not feel the air throb in your ears?' 
line 29483=>     'Yes,' said Gandalf.  
line 29484=>     'What has become of the miserable Orcs?' said Legolas.  
line 29485=>     'That, I think, no one will ever know,' said Gandalf. 
line 29486=>     They  rode  in silence for a while; but  Legolas was ever glancing from 
line 29487=>side to side, and would often have halted  to  listen to  the  sounds of the 
line 29488=>wood, if Gimli had allowed it. 
line 29489=>     'These are the strangest trees that ever I saw,'  he said; 'and  I have 
line 29490=>seen many  an  oak grow from acorn  to ruinous age.  I wish that  there were 
line 29491=>leisure now to walk among  them: they have voices, and  in time I might come 
line 29492=>to understand their thought.' 
line 29493=>     'No, no!'  said  Gimli.  'Let  us leave  them!  I guess  their  thought 
line 29494=>already: hatred of all that go on two legs; and their  speech is of crushing 
line 29495=>and strangling.' 
line 29496=>     'Not of all that go on two legs,' said  Legolas. 'There I think you are 
line 29497=>wrong.  It is Orcs that they hate.  For they  do not  belong  here and  know 
line 29498=>little of Elves and  Men. Far away  are the valleys where they sprang.  From 
line 29499=>the deep dales of Fangorn, Gimli, that is whence they come, I guess.' 
line 29500=>     'Then that is the most  perilous wood in Middle-earth,'  said Gimli. 'I  
line 29501=>should  be grateful for  the part they have played, but I  do not love them. 
line 29502=>You may think them wonderful, but I have seen a greater wonder in this land, 
line 29503=>more beautiful than any grove or glade that  ever   grew: my  heart  is still 
line 29504=>full of ft. 'Strange are the ways of Men, Legolas! Here they have one of the 
line 29505=>marvels of the Northern  World, and what do they say of it? Caves, they say! 
line 29506=>Caves! Holes to fly to in time of  war, to store fodder in! My good Legolas, 
line 29507=>do you  know that the caverns of Helm's Deep  are vast and beautiful?  There 
line 29508=>would  be an  endless pilgrimage of Dwarves, merely to gaze at them, if such 
line 29509=>things  were known  to be. Aye indeed, they would pay pure gold  for a brief 
line 29510=>glance!' 
line 29511=>     'And I would give  gold to be excused,' said Legolas; 'and double to be 
line 29512=>let out, if I strayed in!' 
line 29513=>     'You have not seen, so I forgive your jest,' said Gimli. 'But you speak 
line 29514=>like a fool. Do you think those halls are fair, where your King dwells under  
line 29515=>the hill in Mirkwood, and Dwarves helped in their making long  ago? They are 
line 29516=>but hovels compared with  the caverns I have  seen here: immeasurable halls, 
line 29517=>filled with an everlasting music  of  water that tinkles into pools, as fair 
line 29518=>as Kheled-zvram in the starlight. 
line 29519=>
line 29520=>####-     'And, Legolas,  when the torches are kindled and men walk  on the sandy  
line 29521=>floors  under  the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas,  gems  and crystals and  
line 29522=>veins of  precious ore  glint  in the polished  walls; and  the  light glows 
line 29523=>through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen 
line 29524=>Galadriel.  There are  columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose,  Legolas, 
line 29525=>fluted  and twisted into dreamlike forms;  they spring up from many-coloured 
line 29526=>floors to meet the glistening pendants  of  the roof:  wings, ropes, curtains 
line 29527=>fine as  frozen  clouds; spears,  banners, pinnacles  of suspended  palaces!  
line 29528=>Still lakes mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered 
line 29529=>with clear glass;  cities.  such as  the  mind  of Durin  could  scarce have 
line 29530=>imagined in his sleep,  stretch  on through avenues and pillared  courts, on 
line 29531=>into  the dark recesses  where no light can come.  And  plink! a silver drop 
line 29532=>falls,  and the round wrinkles in  the glass make all  the  towers  bend and 
line 29533=>waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. Then evening comes: they 
line 29534=>fade  and twinkle out; the torches pass on into another  chamber and another  
line 29535=>dream. There is chamber after chamber, Legolas;  hall opening  out of  hall, 
line 29536=>dome after  dome,  stair beyond  stair; and still  the winding paths lead on 
line 29537=>into the mountains' heart.  Caves! The Caverns of Helm's Deep! Happy was the 
line 29538=>chance that drove me there! It makes me weep to leave them.' 
line 29539=>     'Then I  will wish you this fortune for your  comfort, Gimli,' said the 
line 29540=>Elf, 'that you may come safe from war and return to  see  them again. But do 
line 29541=>not tell all your kindred! There seems little left for them to do, from your 
line 29542=>account. Maybe the men of  this land  are wise  to say little: one family of 
line 29543=>busy dwarves with hammer and chisel might mar more than they made.' 
line 29544=>     'No, you do not understand,' said Gimli. 'No dwarf could be  unmoved by 
line 29545=>such loveliness. None  of Durin's race would mine those  caves for stones or  
line 29546=>ore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there.  Do you cut down groves  of 
line 29547=>blossoming trees in the spring-time for firewood? We would tend these glades 
line 29548=>of flowering  stone, not  quarry them. With cautious skill, tap  by tap  -- a 
line 29549=>small  chip of rock and no  more, perhaps, in a whole  anxious  day  -- so we 
line 29550=>could work,  and  as the  years went  by, we  should open  up new  ways, and 
line 29551=>display far chambers that  are still dark, glimpsed  only as a  void  beyond 
line 29552=>fissures in the rock. And lights, Legolas! We should make lights, such lamps 
line 29553=>as once shone  in Khazad-dym; and when  we  wished  we  would drive away 
line 29554=>the 
line 29555=>night  that has  lain there  since the hills were made; and when we  desired 
line 29556=>rest, we would let the night return.' 
line 29557=>
line 29558=>####-     'You  move me, Gimli,' said Legolas. 'I have never heard you speak like 
line 29559=>this  before. Almost you make  me regret that  I  have not seen these caves.  
line 29560=>Come! Let us make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the perils that 
line 29561=>await us, we will journey for a while together. You shall visit Fangorn with 
line 29562=>me, and then I will come with you to see Helm's Deep.' 
line 29563=>     'That would not be the way of return that I should choose,' said Gimli. 
line 29564=>'But I will endure Fangorn, if I have your promise to come back to the caves 
line 29565=>and share their wonder with me.' 
line 29566=>     'You have  my promise,' said Legolas. 'But  alas!  Now  we  must  leave 
line 29567=>behind both cave and wood for a while: See! We  are coming to the end of the 
line 29568=>trees. How far is it to Isengard, Gandalf?' 
line 29569=>     'About fifteen leagues, as the crows of Saruman make it.' said Gandalf:  
line 29570=>'five from the mouth of Deeping-coomb to  the Fords: and ten more from there 
line 29571=>to the gates of Isengard. But we shall not ride all the way this night.' 
line 29572=>     'And  when we come there,  what shall  we see?'  asked Gimli. 'You  may 
line 29573=>know, but I cannot guess.' 
line 29574=>     'I do  not know myself for certain,'  answered the wizard. 'I was there 
line 29575=>at  nightfall yesterday, but much may have happened since. Yet  I think that 
line 29576=>you will not say that the journey was  in vain  -- not though the Glittering 
line 29577=>Caves of Aglarond be left behind.' 
line 29578=>     At last the company passed  through  the trees, and found that they had 
line 29579=>come to the bottom of the Coomb, where  the road from Helm's  Deep 
line 29580=>branched, 
line 29581=>going one way east to  Edoras,  and the other north to the Fords of Isen. As 
line 29582=>they  rode from under the eaves of the wood, Legolas  halted and looked back 
line 29583=>with regret. Then he gave a sudden cry. 
line 29584=>     'There are eyes!' he said.  'Eyes looking out  from the shadows  of the 
line 29585=>boughs! I never saw such eyes before.' 
line 29586=>     The others,  surprised  by  his cry,  halted  and turned;  but  Legolas 
line 29587=>started to ride back. 
line 29588=>     'No, no!' cried Gimli. 'Do  as  you please in your madness,  but let me 
line 29589=>first get  down  from  this horse! I wish  to see  no eyes!' 'Stay,  Legolas 
line 29590=>Greenleaf!' said Gandalf. 'Do not go back into the wood, not yet! Now is not 
line 29591=>your time.' 
line 29592=>     Even as he spoke,  there came forward out of  the  trees three  strange 
line 29593=>shapes.  As  tall as trolls they were, twelve feet  or more in height; their 
line 29594=>strong bodies, stout as  young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment or with 
line 29595=>
line 29596=>####-hide of close-fitting grey and br own. Their limbs were long, and their hands 
line 29597=>had many fingers; their hair was stiff, and their beards grey-green as moss.  
line 29598=>They gazed out with solemn  eyes, but they were not  looking at the  riders:  
line 29599=>their eyes were bent northwards.  Suddenly they  lifted their long  hands to 
line 29600=>their  mouths, and  sent forth ringing calls, clear as notes  of a horn, but 
line 29601=>more musical and various.  The calls  were answered; and turning  again, the  
line 29602=>riders  saw other creatures of the same  kind approaching, striding  through 
line 29603=>the grass. They came swiftly from the North, walking  like wading herons  in 
line 29604=>their gait,  but not in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat 
line 29605=>quicker than the heron's  wings.  The riders cried aloud in wonder, and some 
line 29606=>set their hands upon their swor d-hilts. 
line 29607=>     'You need no  weapons,' said Gandalf. 'These are but herdsmen. They are 
line 29608=>not enemies, indeed they are not concerned with us at all.' 
line 29609=>     So  it  seemed to be;  for  as  he spoke the tall creatures,  without a  
line 29610=>glance at the riders, strode into the wood and vanished. 
line 29611=>     'Herdsmen!'  said  Thjoden. 'Where  are their  flocks? What  are  they, 
line 29612=>Gandalf? For it is plain that to you, at any rate, they are not strange.' 
line 29613=>     'They are the shepherds of the trees,' answered Gandalf. 'Is it so long 
line 29614=>since you listened to tales by the fireside? There are children in your land 
line 29615=>who, out  of the twisted  threads of story, could pick the  answer  to  your 
line 29616=>question. You have seen  Ents, O King, Ents out of  Fangorn Forest, which in 
line 29617=>your tongue you call the Entwood. Did you think that the name was given only 
line 29618=>in  idle  fancy?  Nay, Thjoden,  it is otherwise: to  them  you are  but the 
line 29619=>passing tale;  all the years from Eorl the Young to Thjoden  the  Old are of 
line 29620=>little count to them; and all the deeds of your house but a small matter.' 
line 29621=>     The king was silent. 'Ents!' he said at  length. 'Out of the shadows of 
line 29622=>legend I  begin a little to  understand the marvel  of the trees, I think. I 
line 29623=>have  lived  to see  strange  days. Long  we have tended our beasts  and our 
line 29624=>fields, built our houses, wrought  our tools, or ridden away to help in  the 
line 29625=>wars  of  Minas Tirith. And that we called  the life of Men,  the way of the 
line 29626=>world. We cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land. Songs we 
line 29627=>have that  tell of these things, but we are forgetting them,  teaching  them 
line 29628=>only  to children, as  a careless custom. And now  the  songs have come down 
line 29629=>among us out of strange places, and walk visible under the Sun.' 
line 29630=>     'You should  be  glad, Thjoden  King,' said Gandalf. 'For not only  the 
line 29631=>little  life  of Men is  now endangered, but the  life also of  those things 
line 29632=>which you have deemed the matter of legend. You are not without allies, even 
line 29633=>
line 29634=>####-if you know them not.' 
line 29635=>     'Yet  also I should  be sad,' said Thjoden. 'For however the fortune of 
line 29636=>war shall go, may it not so end  that much that was fair and wonderful shall 
line 29637=>pass for ever out of Middle-earth?' 
line 29638=>     'It may,' said Gandalf. 'The evil of Sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor  
line 29639=>made as if it had not been. But to such days we are doomed. Let us now go on 
line 29640=>with the journey we have begun!' 
line 29641=>     The company turned then away from the  Coomb and from the wood and 
line 29642=>took  
line 29643=>the  road  towards the Fords. Legolas followed reluctantly. The sun had set, 
line 29644=>already  it had sunk behind the rim of the world; but  as they rode out from 
line 29645=>the shadow of  the  hills  and looked west to the  Gap  of Rohan the sky was 
line 29646=>still  red, and a burning light was under the  floating clouds. Dark against  
line 29647=>it there wheeled and flew many black -winged birds. Some passed overhead 
line 29648=>wi th 
line 29649=>mournful cries, returning to their homes among the rocks. 
line 29650=>     'The carrion-fowl have been busy about the battle-field,' said Jomer. 
line 29651=>     They rode now at an easy pace and dark came  down upon the plains about 
line 29652=>them. The slow moon mounted,  now  waxing towards the full, and  in its cold 
line 29653=>silver light the swelling grass-lands  rose and fell  like a wide  grey sea. 
line 29654=>They  had ridden for  some four  hours from  the branching of the roads when 
line 29655=>they drew near to the Fords. Long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river  
line 29656=>spread  in stony shoals  between high grassy terraces. Borne upon  the  wind 
line 29657=>they heard the howling of  wolves. Their hearts were heavy,  remembering the 
line 29658=>many men that had fallen in battle in this place. 
line 29659=>     The  road dipped between rising turf-banks, carving its way through the 
line 29660=>terraces to the river's edge, and up again upon the further side. There were 
line 29661=>three  lines of flat stepping-stones  across  the  stream,  and between them 
line 29662=>fords for horses, that went from either brink to a  bare  eyot in the midst. 
line 29663=>The riders looked down upon the crossings,  and  it seemed strange to  them;  
line 29664=>for the Fords had ever been a place full  of the rush  and  chatter of water  
line 29665=>upon stones; but now they  were  silent. The beds of the  stream were almost  
line 29666=>dry, a bare wast e of shingles and grey sand. 
line 29667=>     'This  is  become  a  dreary  place,'  said Jomer. 'What  sickness  has 
line 29668=>befallen the river? Many fair things Saruman has  destroyed: has he devoured 
line 29669=>the springs of Isen too?' 'So it would seem,' said Gandalf. 
line 29670=>     'Alas!'  said Thjoden. 'Must we pass this way,  where the carrion-beasts 
line 29671=>
line 29672=>####-devour so many good Riders of the Mark?' 
line 29673=>     'This is our way,' said Gandalf. 'Grievous is the fall of your men; but 
line 29674=>you shall see that at least the wolves  of the mountains do not devour them. 
line 29675=>It is with their friends, the Orcs, that they hold their feast:  such indeed 
line 29676=>is the friendship of their kind. Come!' 
line 29677=>     They rode down to the river,  and as  they came the wolves ceased their 
line 29678=>howling and  slunk away. Fear  fell on them seeing Gandalf in the moon,  and 
line 29679=>Shadowfax his horse shining like  silver.  The  riders  passed  over to  the 
line 29680=>islet, and glittering eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks. 
line 29681=>     'Look!' said Gandalf. 'Friends have laboured here.' 
line 29682=>     And they saw that  in  the midst  of the eyot  a mound was piled, ringed 
line 29683=>with stones, and set about with many spears. 
line 29684=>     'Here  lie  all the  Men of the Mark that fell  near this place,'  said 
line 29685=>Gandalf. 
line 29686=>     'Here let them rest!' said Jomer. 'And when  their  spears  have rotted 
line 29687=>and rusted, long still may their mound stand and guard the Fords of Isen!' 
line 29688=>     'Is  this  your work  also, Gandalf,  my  friend?'  said Thjoden.  'You  
line 29689=>accomplished much in an evening and a night!' 
line 29690=>     'With  the help of Shadowfax  -- and others,' said Gandalf. 'I rode fast  
line 29691=>and  far.  But here beside the  mound I will say this for your comfort: many 
line 29692=>fell in the battles of the Fords, but fewer than rumour made them. More were 
line 29693=>scattered than were slain;  I gathered together all that I  could find. Some 
line 29694=>men I sent with Grimbold of Westfold  to join Erkenbrand. Some I set to make 
line 29695=>this burial. They  have now followed your marshal,  Elfhelm. I sent him with 
line 29696=>many Riders  to Edoras.  Saruman  I  knew had  despatched  his full strength 
line 29697=>against you, and his  servants  had turned aside from all  other errands and 
line 29698=>gone to Helm's Deep: the  lands seemed empty  of enemies; yet I  feared that 
line 29699=>wolf-riders and plunderers might ride nonetheless  to Meduseld, while it was 
line 29700=>undefended. But now I  think you need not fear:  you will find your house to 
line 29701=>welcome your return.' 
line 29702=>     'And glad shall I be to see it again,' said Thjoden, 'though brief now, 
line 29703=>I doubt not, shall be my abiding there.' 
line 29704=>     With that the  company said  farewell to the island  and the mound, and 
line 29705=>passed over the river, and climbed the further bank. Then they rode on, glad 
line 29706=>to have left the mournful  Fords. As they  went  the  howling of the  wolves 
line 29707=>broke out anew. 
line 29708=>     There  was an  ancient highway that  ran  down  from  Isengard  to  the 
line 29709=>
line 29710=>####-crossings. For some way i t took its course beside the river, bending with it 
line 29711=>east  and  then north; but at  the last it  turned away  and  went  straight 
line 29712=>towards the gates of Isengard; and these were under the mountain-side in the  
line 29713=>west of the valley, sixteen miles  or more from its mouth.  This  road  they 
line 29714=>followed but they  did not ride upon it;  for the ground beside it  was firm 
line 29715=>and level, covered for many miles about with short springing turf. They rode  
line 29716=>now more swiftly, and by midnight the Fords were nearly five leagues behind. 
line 29717=>Then they halted, ending their night's journey, for the King was weary. They 
line 29718=>were come to  the feet  of the  Misty  Mountains, and the long  arms of  Nan 
line 29719=>Curunnr stretched down to  meet them. Dark lay the vale before them, for the 
line 29720=>moon had  passed  into  the West, and its light was hidden by the hills. But 
line 29721=>out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as 
line 29722=>it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimmering 
line 29723=>billows, black and silver, over the starry sky. 
line 29724=>     'What do you  think  of that,  Gandalf?' asked Aragorn.  'One would say 
line 29725=>that all the Wizard's Vale was burning.' 
line 29726=>     'There  is ever a fume above  that  valley in these  days,' said Jomer: 
line 29727=>'but I have never seen aught like this before. These are  steams rather than 
line 29728=>smokes. Saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us. Maybe he is boiling all 
line 29729=>the waters of Isen, and that is why the river runs dry.' 
line 29730=>     'Maybe he is,' said Gandalf. 'Tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing. 
line 29731=>Now let us rest for a while,  if we can.' 
line 29732=>     They camped  beside  the bed of the Isen river; it was still silent and 
line 29733=>empty. Some of them slept a little. But late in the night the watchmen cried 
line 29734=>out, and all awoke. The moon was gone.  Stars were  shining  above; but over 
line 29735=>the ground there crept a darkness blacker than the night.  On both  sides of 
line 29736=>the river it rolled towards them, going northward. 
line 29737=>     'Stay where you are!' said Gandalf. 'Draw no weapons! Wait! and it will 
line 29738=>pass you by!' 
line 29739=>     A mist gathered about  them. Above  them a  few stars  still  glimmered 
line 29740=>faintly;  but  on either side there arose  walls of impenetrable gloom; they 
line 29741=>were in a narrow  lane between moving towers of shadow. Voices  they  heard, 
line 29742=>whisperings  and groanings and an  endless  rustling sigh;  the  earth shook 
line 29743=>under them. Long  it  seemed to them that they sat  and  were afraid; but at 
line 29744=>last the darkness and the rumour passed, and vanished between the mountain's 
line 29745=>arms. 
line 29746=>     Away south upon the Hornburg, in the  middle  night  men heard a  great 
line 29747=>
line 29748=>####-noise, as a wind  in the valley, and the ground trembled; and all were afraid 
line 29749=>and no one ventured to go forth. But in the morning  they went  out and were 
line 29750=>amazed; for  the slain Orcs were gone, and the trees also. Far down into the 
line 29751=>valley of the Deep  the grass was crushed   and trampled brown,  as if  giant 
line 29752=>herdsmen had  pastured  great droves of  cattle there;  but a mile below the 
line 29753=>Dike a huge pit had  been delved in the earth, and over it stones were piled 
line 29754=>into  a  hill.  Men believed that the Orcs whom they had  slain  were buried 
line 29755=>there;  but whether those  who had  fled into  the wood were with them, none 
line 29756=>could say, for no man  ever  set foot upon that hill. The Death Down it  was 
line 29757=>afterwards called, and no grass would grow there. But the strange trees were 
line 29758=>never seen in Deeping-coomb again; they had  returned at night, and had gone 
line 29759=>far  away to the dark dales  of  Fangorn.  Thus they were  revenged upon the 
line 29760=>Orcs. 
line 29761=>     The king  and his company slept  no more that  night;  but they saw and 
line 29762=>heard  no other strange thing,  sa ve one: the voice of the river beside them 
line 29763=>suddenly  awoke. There  was a  rush of water hurrying down among the stones;  
line 29764=>and when it had  passed, the Isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again, as it 
line 29765=>had ever done. 
line 29766=>     At  dawn  they made ready to go on. The light came grey  and pale,  and 
line 29767=>they  did  not see  the rising of the sun. The air above was heavy with fog, 
line 29768=>and a reek lay on the land about them. They went slowly, riding now upon the 
line 29769=>highway.  It  was broad and  hard, and  well -tended. Dimly through the mists 
line 29770=>they could  descry the long arm of the mountains rising on  their left. They 
line 29771=>had passed into Nan Curunnr, the Wizard's Vale. That was a sheltered valley, 
line 29772=>open only to the South. Once  it had been fair and green, and through it the 
line 29773=>Isen flowed, already deep and strong before it found  the plains; for it was 
line 29774=>fed by many springs and lesser streams among  the rain-washed hills. and all  
line 29775=>about it there had lain a pleasant, fertile land. 
line 29776=>     It was not so now. Beneath the walls of Isengard there still were acres 
line 29777=>tilled  by  the  slaves  of Saruman;  but  most  of the valley had  become a  
line 29778=>wilderness of  weeds and  thorns.  Brambles  trailed  upon  the  ground,  or 
line 29779=>clambering over bush and  bank, made shaggy caves where small beasts 
line 29780=>housed. 
line 29781=>No  trees grew there; but among  the rank  grasses  could still be  seen the 
line 29782=>burned and axe-hewn stumps of ancient groves. It  was  a sad country, silent  
line 29783=>now  but for the stony noise  of quick  waters. Smokes and steams drifted in  
line 29784=>sullen clouds and lurked  in the  hollows.  The  riders did  not speak.  Many 
line 29785=>
line 29786=>####-doubted in their hearts, wondering to what dismal end their journey led. 
line 29787=>     After they had ridden for some miles, the highway became a wide street,  
line 29788=>paved with great flat stones, squared and laid with skill; no blade of  grass 
line 29789=>was seen in any joint. Deep  gutters, filled with  trickling water. ran down 
line 29790=>on either side. Suddenly  a tall pillar loomed up before them. It was black; 
line 29791=>and set upon it was a great stone, carved and painted in the likeness  of  a  
line 29792=>long  White Hand. Its finger pointed north. Not far now they knew  that  the 
line 29793=>gates of Isengard  must stand, and  their hearts  were heavy; but their eyes 
line 29794=>could not pierce the mists ahead. 
line 29795=>     Beneath  the  mountain's  arm within  the  Wizard's Vale through  years 
line 29796=>uncounted had stood that ancient place that  Men called Isengard.  Partly it 
line 29797=>was shaped  in  the making of  the mountains, but  mighty works  the  Men of 
line 29798=>Westernesse had wrought there of  old; and Saruman  had dwelt there long and 
line 29799=>had not been idle. 
line 29800=>     This  was  its fashion,  while Saruman was at  his height, accounted by 
line 29801=>many the chief of Wizards. A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, 
line 29802=>stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran  and then 
line 29803=>returned again. One entrance only was there made in  it, a great arch delved 
line 29804=>in the  southern wall. Here  through the black  rock a long  tunnel had been 
line 29805=>hewn, closed at either end with mighty  doors of iron.  They were so wrought 
line 29806=>and poised upon their  huge hinges, posts of  steel driven  into the  living 
line 29807=>stone, that  when unbarred they could  be moved with  a light  thrust of the 
line 29808=>arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of  the  echoing  
line 29809=>tunnel,  beheld a  plain,  a great  circle, somewhat  hollowed  like a  vast  
line 29810=>shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and 
line 29811=>filled  with avenues, and  groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams that 
line 29812=>flowed  from the mountains to  a lake. But no green thing grew there  in the 
line 29813=>latter  days of Saruman. The  roads wer e  paved with stone-flags,  dark  and 
line 29814=>hard;  and beside their borders instead of trees there marched long lines of 
line 29815=>pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron. joined by heavy chains.  
line 29816=>     Many  houses  there  were,  chambers,  halls,  and  passages,  cut  and 
line 29817=>tunnelled back into the  walls upon their  inner side, so that all  the open 
line 29818=>circle  was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors. Thousands  could 
line 29819=>dwell  there,  workers, servants, slaves, and warriors with  great  store of 
line 29820=>arms; wolves  were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath. The plain, too, was 
line 29821=>bored and delved. Shafts were driven deep into the  ground; their upper ends  
line 29822=>were  covered by low mounds and domes of stone, so that in the moonlight the 
line 29823=>
line 29824=>####-Ring  of Isengard looked like a  graveyard  of  unquiet dead. For the ground  
line 29825=>trembled. The shafts  ran  down by many slopes and  spiral stairs to caverns 
line 29826=>far under; there Saruman had treasuries,  store-houses, armouries, smithies,  
line 29827=>and  great  furnaces.  Iron  wheels  revolved  there endlessly, and  hammers 
line 29828=>thudded. At night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents, lit  from beneath 
line 29829=>with red light, or blue, or venomous green. 
line 29830=>     To the  centre  all the roads ran between  their chains. There stood  a  
line 29831=>tower of  marvellous shape.  It  was  fashioned by  the builders of old, who 
line 29832=>smoothed  the  Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed  a thing not  made by the 
line 29833=>craft  of Men, but riven from the bones of the  earth in the ancient torment 
line 29834=>of the hills. A peak and isle of rock  it was. black and gleaming hard: four 
line 29835=>mighty piers of many-sided stone were  welded  into one, but near the summit 
line 29836=>they  opened  into gaping  horns. their  pinnacles sharp  as the  points  of 
line 29837=>spears, keen-edged as  knives. Between  them was a narrow  space,  and there 
line 29838=>upon a floor of   polished stone,  written  with  strange signs,  a man might  
line 29839=>stand  five  hundred feet above the plain. This was Orthanc,  the citadel of 
line 29840=>Saruman, the  name of which had (by design or chance) a twofold meaning; for  
line 29841=>in the Elvish  speech orthanc  signifies Mount Fang,  but in the language of 
line 29842=>the Mark of old the Cunning Mind. 
line 29843=>     A strong  place  and wonderful  was  Isengard,  and  long  it had  been 
line 29844=>beautiful;  and there great lords had dwelt, the wardens of  Gondor upon the 
line 29845=>West, and wise men that watched the stars.  But Saruman had slowly shaped it 
line 29846=>to  his  shifting  purposes,  and made  it  better.  as  he  thought,  being 
line 29847=>deceived-for  all  those arts and  subtle devices, for which  he forsook his 
line 29848=>former  wisdom, and which fondly  he imagined  were his own. came  but  
line 29849=>from 
line 29850=>Mordor; so that what he made was naught, only a little copy, a child's model  
line 29851=>or a slave's  flattery, of that  vast fortress. armoury, prison,  furnace of 
line 29852=>great power, Barad-dyr, the Dark Tower, which suffered no rival, and laughed 
line 29853=>at  flattery, biding its  time, secure  in  its pride and  its  immeasurable 
line 29854=>strength. 
line 29855=>     This  was  the stronghold of  Saruman, as  fame reported it; for within 
line 29856=>living memory the men of Rohan had not passed its gates, save perhaps a few,  
line 29857=>such as Wormtongue, who came in secret and told no man what they saw.  
line 29858=>     Now Gandalf rode to the great pillar of the Hand, and passed it: and as 
line 29859=>he did so the Riders  saw to  their wonder that  the Hand appeared no longer  
line 29860=>white. It was stained as with dried blood; and looking closer they perceived 
line 29861=>
line 29862=>####-that its  nails were red.  Unheeding  Gandalf rode  on  into  the mist,  and 
line 29863=>reluctantly  they followed him. All about them now,  as if  there had been a  
line 29864=>sudden flood.  wide pools of water lay beside the road, filling the hollows.  
line 29865=>and rills went trickling down among the stones.  
line 29866=>     At last Gandalf  halted  and beckoned to them; and they  came, and  saw 
line 29867=>that beyond him  the mists  had cleared, and a pale sunlight shone. The hour  
line 29868=>of noon had passed. They were come to the doors of Isengard. 
line 29869=>     But the  doors lay  hurled and twisted  on the ground.  And  all about, 
line 29870=>stone, cracked  and  splintered into  countless jagged shards, was scattered 
line 29871=>far and wide, or piled in ruinous heaps. The great arch  still stood, but it 
line 29872=>opened now upon a roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare.  and through the 
line 29873=>cliff-like walls  on  either side great  rents  and  breaches had been torn; 
line 29874=>their towers were beaten into  dust. If the Great Sea had risen in wrath and 
line 29875=>fallen on the hills with storm. it could ha ve worked no greater ruin. 
line 29876=>     The ring beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron, in 
line 29877=>which  there heaved  and floated  a wreckage of beams and  spars, chests and 
line 29878=>casks and broken  gear. Twisted and leaning pillars reared their  splintered 
line 29879=>stems above the  flood. but all the roads were drowned. Far off, it  seemed, 
line 29880=>half veiled in  winding cloud, there loomed the  island rock. Still dark and 
line 29881=>tall, unbroken by the storm,  the tower of Orthanc stood. Pale waters lapped  
line 29882=>about its feet. 
line 29883=>     The  king and all his company  sat silent on  their horses, marvelling, 
line 29884=>perceiving  that the power of Saruman was overthrown; but how they could not 
line 29885=>guess.  And  now they turned their eyes towards the archway  and  the ruined 
line 29886=>gates. There they  saw close  beside  them a great rubble-heap; and suddenly 
line 29887=>they were aware  of two small figures  lying on it at their ease, grey-clad, 
line 29888=>hardly  to  be seen  among  the  stones. There were  bottles and  bowls  and 
line 29889=>platters  laid beside them, as if  they had just eaten  well, and now rested 
line 29890=>from their labour. One seemed asleep; the other, with crossed legs  and arms 
line 29891=>behind his head,  leaned  back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth 
line 29892=>long wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke. 
line 29893=>     For  a  moment Thjoden  and Jomer  and all  his men  stared at  them in 
line 29894=>wonder.  Amid all the  wreck  of Isengard  this seemed to them the strangest  
line 29895=>sight.  But  before the king could speak,  the  small smoke-breathing figure 
line 29896=>became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent  on the edge of  the 
line 29897=>mist. He sprang to his feet. A young man he looked, or like one, though  not  
line 29898=>much  more than half a man  in height; his head  of  brown curling hair  was 
line 29899=>
line 29900=>####-uncovered,  but he was  clad in a  travel-stained cloak of the same  hue and 
line 29901=>shape a s the companions  of Gandalf had worn when  they rode  to Edoras.  He 
line 29902=>bowed very low. putting  his  hand upon  his breast.  Then,  seeming not  to 
line 29903=>observe the wizard and his friends, he turned to Jomer and the king. 
line 29904=>     'Welcome, my lords,  to  Isengard!' he said. 'We  are  the doorwardens. 
line 29905=>Meriadoc,  son  of  Saradoc  is  my  name; and my  companion, who,  alas! is 
line 29906=>overcome with  weariness'  -- here he gave the other a dig with  his  foot -- 
line 29907=>'is Peregrin, son of Paladin, of the house of Took. Far in the North  is our 
line 29908=>home. The Lord Saruman  is within; but at the moment he is closeted with one 
line 29909=>Wormtongue,  or  doubtless  he  would be here  to  welcome  such  honourable 
line 29910=>guests.' 
line 29911=>     'Doubtless he would!' laughed Gandalf. 'And was it Saruman that ordered 
line 29912=>you to  guard his  damaged  doors, and watch for the arrival of guests, when 
line 29913=>your attention could be spared from plate and bottle?' 
line 29914=>     'No, good sir, the matter escaped him,' answered Merry gravely 'He  has 
line 29915=>been much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who  has taken  over 
line 29916=>the 
line 29917=>management of Isengard. He  commanded me to  welcome  the Lord of Rohan 
line 29918=>with 
line 29919=>fitting words. I have done my best.' 
line 29920=>     'And  what about  your companions?  What about  Legolas  and me?' cried 
line 29921=>Gimli, unable to contain himself longer .  'You rascals, you woolly-footed and 
line 29922=>wool-pated truants!  A fine  hunt you  have  led  us! Two  hundred  leagues,  
line 29923=>through  fen and forest, battle  and death, to  rescue you! And here we find 
line 29924=>you feasting and  idling-and smoking!  Smoking! Where did  you  come  by the 
line 29925=>weed, you villains?  Hammer and  tongs!  I am so torn between  rage and joy, 
line 29926=>that if I do not burst. it will be a marvel!' 
line 29927=>     'You  speak  for  me, Gimli,' laughed Legolas.  'Though I would  sooner  
line 29928=>learn how they came by the wine.' 
line 29929=>     'One thing you  have  not found  in your hunting,  and that's  brighter 
line 29930=>wits,' said  Pippin, opening an eye. 'Here you find us sitting on a field of 
line 29931=>victory, amid  the plunder of armies, and  you wonder how we  came by  a few 
line 29932=>well-earned comforts!' 
line 29933=>     'Well-earned?' said Gimli. 'I cannot believe that!' 
line 29934=>     The  Riders laughed. 'It cannot be doubted  that we witness the meeting 
line 29935=>of dear friends,' said Thjoden. 'So these are the lost ones of your company, 
line 29936=>Gandalf? The days are fated  to  be filled with marvels.  Already I have seen  
line 29937=>
line 29938=>####-many since I left my house; and now here before my eyes stand yet another of 
line 29939=>the folk of legend. Are not these the Halflings, that some among us call the 
line 29940=>Holbytlan?' 
line 29941=>     'Hobbits, if you please, lord,' said Pippin. 
line 29942=>     'Hobbits?'  said Thjoden. 'Your  tongue is  strangely changed; but  the 
line 29943=>name sounds  not  unfitting so.  Hobbits! No report that I have  heard  does 
line 29944=>justice to the truth.' 
line 29945=>     Merry  bowed; and Pippin got up and bowed low. 'You are gracious, lord; 
line 29946=>or I hope  that I may so take your words,'  he said.  'And  here is  another  
line 29947=>marvel! I have wandered in  many lands, since I left my home, and never till 
line 29948=>now have I found people that knew any story concerning hobbits.' 
line 29949=>     'My people came out of the North long  ago,' said  Thjoden. 'But I will 
line 29950=>not deceive  you: we know no tales  about hobbits. All that is said among us 
line 29951=>is that far away, over many hills and  rivers, live  the halfling folk  that 
line 29952=>dwell in holes in sand-dunes. But there are no legends of their  deeds.  for 
line 29953=>it  is said that they do little, and avoid the sight of  men, being able  to 
line 29954=>vanish in  a  twinkling: and they  can change their voices  to  resemble the 
line 29955=>piping of birds. But it seems that more could be said.' 
line 29956=>     'It could indeed, lord,' said Merry. 
line 29957=>     'For one thing,' said Thjoden, 'I had not heard that they spouted smoke 
line 29958=>from their mouths.' 
line 29959=>     'That is not surprising,'  answered Merry; 'for  it is an art which  we 
line 29960=>have  not  practised  for  more  than  a  few  generations.  It  was  Tobold 
line 29961=>Hornblower,  of Longbottom  in the Southfarthing,  who  first grew  the true 
line 29962=>pipe-weed  in his gardens, about  the year  1070 according to our reckoning.  
line 29963=>How old Toby came by the plant...' 
line 29964=>     'You do  not  know your  danger,  Thjoden,' interrupted Gandalf. 'These 
line 29965=>hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table, 
line 29966=>or the small doings of  their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers,  
line 29967=>and  remoter cousins to the ninth degree,  if  you encourage them with undue 
line 29968=>patience. Some  other time wou ld be more fitting for the history of smoking. 
line 29969=>Where is Treebeard, Merry?' 
line 29970=>     'Away on the north side, I believe. He went to  get  a  drink-of  clean 
line 29971=>water. Most of the other Ents are with him, still busy at their work -- over  
line 29972=>there.' Merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake; and as  they looked, 
line 29973=>they heard a  distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was  falling 
line 29974=>from  the  mountain-side.  Far  away  came a  hoom-hom, as of  horns blowing 
line 29975=>
line 29976=>####-triumphantly. 
line 29977=>     'And is Orthanc then left unguarded?' asked Gandalf.  
line 29978=>     'There is  the water,' said Merry. 'But Quickbeam and  some  others are 
line 29979=>watching it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain  are of  Saruman's 
line 29980=>planting. Quickbeam, I think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair.' 
line 29981=>     'Yes, a tall grey Ent is there,' said Legolas, 'but his arms are at his 
line 29982=>sides, and he stands as still as a door -tree.' 
line 29983=>     'It is  past  noon,'  said Gandalf, 'and we at any  rate have not eaten 
line 29984=>since early morning. Yet I wish  to  see Treebeard as soon as may be. Did he  
line 29985=>leave me no message, or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind?' 
line 29986=>     'He left a message,' said  Merry, 'and  I was coming to  it, but I have 
line 29987=>been hindered by many other questions. I was to say that, if the Lord of the 
line 29988=>Mark and Gandalf  will ride  to  the northern wall  they will find Treebeard 
line 29989=>there,  and he will welcome them. I may add that they will also find food of 
line 29990=>the best there, it  was discovered and selected by your humble servants.' He 
line 29991=>bowed. 
line 29992=>     Gandalf laughed. 'That is  better!' he  said. 'Well,  Thjoden. will you  
line 29993=>ride with me  to find Treebeard?  We must go round about, but it is not far. 
line 29994=>When you see Treebeard,  you will learn much. For  Treebeard is Fangorn, and 
line 29995=>the eldest and chief of the  Ents, and when you speak with him you will hear  
line 29996=>the speech of the oldest of all living things.' 
line 29997=>     'I  will come with you,' said  Thjoden. 'Farewell, my hobbits!  May  we 
line 29998=>meet again in my house! There  you shall sit beside me and tell  me all that 
line 29999=>your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires,  as far as  you can reckon 
line 30000=>them; and we will speak also of Tobold the Old and his herb-lore. Farewell!' 
line 30001=>     The hobbits bowed low. 'So that  is the King of Rohan!'  said Pippin in 
line 30002=>an undertone.  'A fine old fellow. Very polite.' 
line 30003=>
line 30004=>####- 
line 30005=>
line 30006=>Chapter 9. Flotsam and Jetsam 
line 30007=>
line 30008=> 
line 30009=> 
line 30010=>     Gandalf and the King's  company rode away, turning eastward to make the 
line 30011=>circuit of the ruined  walls of Isengard.  But  Aragorn, Gimli,  and Legolas 
line 30012=>remained behind. Leaving Arod and Hasufel to  stray in search of grass, they 
line 30013=>came and sat beside the hobbits. 
line 30014=>     'Well, well! The hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of 
line 30015=>us ever thought to come,' said Aragorn. 
line 30016=>     'And now  that the  great ones have gone to discuss high matters,' said 
line 30017=>Legolas,  'the hunters  can  per haps learn the  answers  to  their own small 
line 30018=>riddles. We tracked you  as  far  as  the forest, but there  are  still many 
line 30019=>things that I should like to know the truth of.' 
line 30020=>     'And there is a great deal, too, that we want to  know about you ' said 
line 30021=>Merry.  'We have learnt a few things through Treebeard, the Old Ent, but that 
line 30022=>is not nearly enough.' 
line 30023=>     'All  in good time,' said Legolas. 'We were the hunters, and you should 
line 30024=>give an account of yourselves to us first.' 
line 30025=>     'Or  second,' said Gimli. 'It would  go better after a meal. t  have  a  
line 30026=>sore head; and it is past mid-day. You truants might make  amends by finding 
line 30027=>us some of the plunder that you spoke  of. Food and drink would pay off some 
line 30028=>of my score against you.' 
line 30029=>     'Then you shall  have  it,' said Pippin.  'Will you have it here, or in 
line 30030=>more  comfort in what's left of Saruman's guard-house--over  there under the 
line 30031=>arch? We had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road.' 
line 30032=>     'Less than an eye!' said Gimli. 'But  I will not go into  any orc-house 
line 30033=>nor touch Orcs' meat or anything that they have mauled.' 
line 30034=>     'We wouldn't  ask  you  to,' said Merry. 'We have had  enough  of  Orcs 
line 30035=>ourselves to last a life-time. But there  were  many other folk in Isengard. 
line 30036=>Saruman  kept enough wisdom not  to  trust his Orcs. He had Men to guard his 
line 30037=>gates:  some of his  most faithful  servants,  I  suppose. Anyway  they were 
line 30038=>favoured and got good provisions.' 
line 30039=>     'And pipe-weed?' asked Gimli. 
line 30040=>     'No,  I  don't  think  so,' Merry laughed. 'But that  is another story, 
line 30041=>which can wait until after lunch.' 
line 30042=>     'Well let us go and have lunch then!' said the Dwarf. 
line 30043=>
line 30044=>####-     The hobbits led the way; and they  passed under the arch  and came to a  
line 30045=>wide  door upon the  left, at  the  top of a stair. It opened  direct into a  
line 30046=>large chamber,  with other smaller  doors  at the far end,  and a hearth and 
line 30047=>chimney at one side. The chamber was hewn out of the stone; and it must once 
line 30048=>have  been dark, for its windows looked out only into the  tunnel. But light 
line 30049=>came in now through the broken roof. On the hearth wood was burning. 
line 30050=>     'I  lit a  bit of fire,' said Pippin. 'It cheered us up  in  the  fogs.  
line 30051=>There were few faggots about, and  most of the  wood we could find was  wet. 
line 30052=>But  there  is  a great draught in  the  chimney:  it seems  to wind away up 
line 30053=>through the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked. A fire  is handy. 
line 30054=>I  will  make you some toast. The bread is  three  or four days  old,  I  am 
line 30055=>afraid.' 
line 30056=>     Aragorn and his  companions sat  themselves down at  one  end of a long 
line 30057=>table,  and  the  hobbits  disappeared  through  one  of  the  inner  doors. 
line 30058=>'Store-room  in there,  and above  the woods, luckily,' said Pippin, as they 
line 30059=>came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of various sorts.  
line 30060=>     'And  you need not  turn up your nose at the provender,  Master Gimli,' 
line 30061=>said Merry. 'This is  not orc-stuff, but  man-food, as  Treebeard calls  it. 
line 30062=>Will you have wine or beer? There's a barrel  inside there -- very passable. 
line 30063=>And this is first-rate salted pork. Or  I can cut you  some rashers of bacon 
line 30064=>and  broil them,  if you like.  I am  sorry there  is no  green  stuff:  the 
line 30065=>deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days! I cannot offer  
line 30066=>you  anything  to follow  but butter and  honey  for  your  bread.  Are  you  
line 30067=>content?' 
line 30068=>     'Indeed yes,' said Gimli. 'The score is much reduced.' 
line 30069=>     The  three  were  soon  busy  with  their meal;  and the  two  hobbits, 
line 30070=>unabashed,  set  to  a second time. 'We  must keep our guests company,' they  
line 30071=>said. 
line 30072=>     'You  are full of courtesy this  morning,' laughed Legolas.  'But maybe. 
line 30073=>if  we  had  not arrived, you  would already have been keeping  one  another  
line 30074=>company again.' 
line 30075=>     'Maybe; and why not?' said Pippin. 'We had foul fare with the Orcs, and 
line 30076=>little enough for days before that. It seems a long while since we could eat 
line 30077=>to heart's content.' 
line 30078=>     'It does not seem to have done you any harm,' said Aragorn. 'Indeed you  
line 30079=>look in the bloom of health.' 
line 30080=>     'Aye, you do indeed,' said Gimli, looking them up and down over the top  
line 30081=>
line 30082=>####-of his cup. 'Why,  your hair is twice as thick and curly  as when we parted; 
line 30083=>and I would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for 
line 30084=>hobbits of your age. This Treebeard at any rate has not starved you.' 
line 30085=>     'He has not,' said Merry. 'But Ents on ly drink, and drink is not enough 
line 30086=>for content. Treebeard's draughts may be nourishing,  but one feels the need 
line 30087=>of something solid. And even lembas is none the worse for a change.' 
line 30088=>     'You have drunk of  the waters of the  Ents, have  you?'  said Legolas.  
line 30089=>'Ah, then I think it is likely that Gimli's eyes do not deceive him. Strange 
line 30090=>songs have been sung of the draughts of Fangorn.' 
line 30091=>     'Many strange tales  have been told about that land,' said Aragorn.  'I  
line 30092=>have never entered it. Come, tell me more about it, and about the Ents!' 
line 30093=>     'Ents,'  said Pippin,  'Ents are -- well  Ents are all different for on 
line 30094=>thing. But their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' He tried a few fumbling 
line 30095=>words that trailed  off into silence. 'Oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen 
line 30096=>some at a distance, already -they saw you  at any rate, and reported that you  
line 30097=>were on  the way-and you  will see many others,  I  expect, before you leave 
line 30098=>here. You must form your own ideas.' 
line 30099=>     'Now,  now!' said Gimli. 'We are beginning the story  in the middle.  I 
line 30100=>should like a tale in the  right order,  starting with that strange day when 
line 30101=>our fellowship was broken.' 
line 30102=>     'You  shall have it, if there  is time,'  said Merry. 'But first -if you  
line 30103=>have finished eating-you shall fill  your pipes and light up. And  then for a  
line 30104=>little while we can pretend that we are all back safe  at Bree again,  or in 
line 30105=>Rivendell.' 
line 30106=>     He produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. 'We have heaps of it,' 
line 30107=>he said; 'and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. We  did some 
line 30108=>salvage-work  this morning, Pippin and I. There are lots of things  floating 
line 30109=>about. It  was Pippin who found two  small barrels,  washed up  out of  some  
line 30110=>cellar  or  store-house, I suppose. When we opened them, we found they  were 
line 30111=>filled with this:  as fine  a  pipe-weed  as  you could  wish  for, and quite 
line 30112=>unspoilt.' 
line 30113=>     Gimli  took some  and rubbed it in his  palms and sniffed it. 'It feels 
line 30114=>good, and it smells good,' he said. 
line 30115=>     'It is good!' said  Merry. 'My dear Gimli, it is Longbottom Leaf! There 
line 30116=>were  the  Hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as  plain as plain.  How it  
line 30117=>came here, I can't imagine. For Saruman's private use. I fancy. I never knew 
line 30118=>that it went so far abroad. But it comes in handy now?' 
line 30119=>
line 30120=>####-     'It  would,' said Gimli, 'if I had a pipe to go  with it. Alas, I  lost 
line 30121=>mine in Moria, or before. Is there no pipe in all your plunder?' 
line 30122=>     'No, I am  afraid  not,' said Merry. 'We have  not found any, not  even 
line 30123=>here in the guardrooms. Saruman kept this dainty to himself. it seems. And I  
line 30124=>don't think it would be any use knocking on the doors of  Orthanc  to beg  a  
line 30125=>pipe of him! We shall have to share pipes. as good friends must at a pinch.' 
line 30126=>     'Half a moment!' said Pippin. Putting his hand inside the breast of his 
line 30127=>jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string. 'I keep a treasure or  
line 30128=>two near my  skin, as precious as  Rings  to  me.  Here's one: my old wooden 
line 30129=>pipe.  And  here's another: an unused one. I have carried  it  a  long way,, 
line 30130=>though  I don't know why.  I never really expected to find  any pipe-weed on 
line 30131=>the journey, when my own ran  out. But now it comes in useful after all.' He 
line 30132=>held  up a small  pipe with a wide  flattened bowl, and handed it to  Gimli. 
line 30133=>'Does that settle the score between  us?' he said. 'Settle it!' cried Gimli. 
line 30134=>'Most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.' 
line 30135=>     'Well, I am going back into the  open air, to see what the wind and sky 
line 30136=>are doing!' said Legolas.  
line 30137=>     'We will come with you,' said Aragorn. 
line 30138=>     They went  out and seated themselves  upon the piled stones before  the 
line 30139=>gateway. They could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting  
line 30140=>and floating away upon the breeze. 
line 30141=>     'Now let  us take our ease  here for a little!' said Aragorn.  'We will 
line 30142=>sit  on the  edge  of  ruin and talk,  as Gandalf  says,  while  he  is busy 
line 30143=>elsewhere. I feel a weariness such as I have seldom felt before.' He wrapped  
line 30144=>his grey cloak about him, hiding  his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long 
line 30145=>legs. Then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke. 
line 30146=>     'Look!' said Pippin. 'Strider the Ranger has come back!' 
line 30147=>     'He has never been away,' said Aragorn.  'I am Strider and D®nadan too,  
line 30148=>and I belong both to Gondor and the North.' 
line 30149=>     They smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them; slanting 
line 30150=>into the valley from among white clouds high in the West. Legolas lay still, 
line 30151=>looking  up at  the  sun and  sky with steady eyes,  and singing  softly  to 
line 30152=>himself.  At last he sat  up. 'Come  now!' he said. 'Time  wears on, and the 
line 30153=>mists  are  blowing away, or  would  if  you  strange folk did  not  wreathe 
line 30154=>yourselves in smoke. What of the tale?' 
line 30155=>     'Well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all 
line 30156=>strung-up in an orc-camp,' said Pippin. 'Let me see, what is today?' 
line 30157=>
line 30158=>####-     'The fifth of March  in the Shire-reckoning,' said Aragorn. Pippin made 
line 30159=>some calculations on his fingers. 'Only nine days ago!' he  said.1 'It seems 
line 30160=>a year since we were caught. Well, though half of it was like a bad dream, I 
line 30161=>reckon that three  very horrible days  followed. Merry will correct me, if I 
line 30162=>forget anything important: I am not going into details:  the  whips and  the 
line 30163=>filth  and stench  and all that; it does not bear remembering.' With that he 
line 30164=>plunged  into an account of Boromir's last fight and the orc-march from Emyn 
line 30165=>Muil to the Forest.  The others  nodded as the various points were fitted in 
line 30166=>with their guesses.  
line 30167=>     'Here are some treasures that you let fall,' said Aragorn. 'You will be 
line 30168=>glad to have them back.' He loosened his belt from under his cloak  and took  
line 30169=>from it the two sheathed knives.  
line 30170=>     'Well!' said  Merry. 'I  never expected  to see those again! I marked a  
line 30171=>few orcs with mine; but Ugl®k  took them from us. How he glared! At first  I 
line 30172=>thought he  was going to  stab me, but he threw the  things away as if  they 
line 30173=>burned him.' 
line 30174=>     'And here also is  your brooch, Pippin,' said Aragorn. 'I have kept  it 
line 30175=>safe, for it is a very precious thing.' 
line 30176=>     'I know,'  said Pippin.  'It was a  wrench  to let it go; but what else 
line 30177=>could I do?' 
line 30178=>     'Nothing else,' answered Aragorn. 'One who cannot cast away  a treasure 
line 30179=>at need is in fetters. You did rightly.' 
line 30180=>     'The cutting of the bands on your wrists,  that was smart  work!'  said 
line 30181=>Gimli. 'Luck  served you there; but you seized your chance with both  hands, 
line 30182=>one might say. ' 
line 30183=>     'And set us a  pretty  riddle,' said  Legolas. 'I  wondered  if you had 
line 30184=>grown wings!' 
line 30185=>     'Unfortunately  not,'  said  Pippin.  'But  you  did   not  know  about 
line 30186=>Grishnbkh.' He shuddered and said  no more, leaving  Merry to tell of  those  
line 30187=>last horrible moments: the  pawing hands, the hot  breath, and  the dreadful 
line 30188=>strength of Grishnbkh's hairy arms.  
line 30189=>     'All this about the  Orcs of Barad-dyr, Lugb®rz as  they call it, makes 
line 30190=>me uneasy,' said  Aragorn.  'The  Dark Lord  already knew  too much and  his 
line 30191=>servants also; and Grishnbkh  evidently sent some message  across  the River 
line 30192=>after the quarrel. The Red Eye will be looking towards Isengard. But Saruman 
line 30193=>at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.' 
line 30194=>     'Yes, whichever side  wins, his outlook is poor,'  said  Merry. 'Things 
line 30195=>
line 30196=>####-began to go all wrong for him from the moment his Orcs set foot in Rohan.' 
line 30197=>     'We caught  a glimpse  of  the old villain, or so Gandalf  hints,' said 
line 30198=>Gimli. 'On the edge of the Forest.' 
line 30199=>     'When was that?' asked Pippin. 
line 30200=>     'Five nights ago,' said Aragorn. 
line 30201=>     'Let me see,' said Merry: 'five nights ago-now we come to a part of the 
line 30202=>story  you  know nothing  about.  We met  Treebeard that morning  after  the  
line 30203=>battle; and that night we were  at Wellinghall,  one of his ent-houses.  The 
line 30204=>next  morning  we  went to  Entmoot, a gathering of Ents, that is,  and  the 
line 30205=>queerest thing  I have ever seen in my life. It lasted all that  day and the 
line 30206=>next; and we spent the nights with an Ent called Quickbeam. And then late in 
line 30207=>the afternoon in the third day of their moot,  the Ents suddenly blew up. It 
line 30208=>was amazing. The Forest had  felt as tense as if a  thunderstorm was brewing 
line 30209=>inside it: then  all at once  it exploded. I wish you could have heard their 
line 30210=>song as they marched.' 
line 30211=>     'If Saruma n had heard it, he would be a hundred miles away by now, even 
line 30212=>if he had had to run on his own legs,' said Pippin. 
line 30213=>     'Though Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone, 
line 30214=>     We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door! 
line 30215=>     There was  very much more. A  great deal  of the song had no words, and  
line 30216=>was like a music of horns and drums.  It was very exciting. But I thought it 
line 30217=>was only marching music and no more, just a song  -- until I got here. I know 
line 30218=>better now.' 
line 30219=>     'We came down  over  the last  ridge  into Nan Curunnr, after night had 
line 30220=>fallen,' Merry continued. 'It was then that I first had the feeling that the 
line 30221=>Forest itself  was  moving  behind  us. I thought  I was dreaming  an entish 
line 30222=>dream, but  Pippin had noticed  it too. We were both frightened; but  we did  
line 30223=>not find out more about it until later. 
line 30224=>     'It  was  the  Huorns,  or so the Ents call them  in "short  language". 
line 30225=>Treebeard  won't say much about them,  but  I think they are Ents that  have 
line 30226=>become almost  like trees, at least to look at. They stand here and there in 
line 30227=>the wood or under its eaves, silent, watching endlessly over the trees;  but 
line 30228=>deep  in the  darkest  dales there  are hundreds and  hundreds  of  them,  I 
line 30229=>believe. 
line 30230=>     'There is a great power in  them, and they seem able to wrap themselves 
line 30231=>in shadow: it  is difficult to see  them moving. But  they do. They can move 
line 30232=>very quickly, if  they are angry.  You  stand still  looking at the weather, 
line 30233=>
line 30234=>####-maybe, or listening to the rustling of  the wind, and then  suddenly you find 
line 30235=>that  you  are in the middle of a wood with great  groping trees  all around 
line 30236=>you. They still have voices, and can speak with the Ents  -- that is why they 
line 30237=>are called Huorns, Treebeard says  -- but they  have  become queer and  wild.  
line 30238=>Danger ous. I should be terrified of meeting them, if there were no true Ents 
line 30239=>about to look after them. 
line 30240=>     'Well, in the early night  we crept  down a  long ravine into the upper  
line 30241=>end of the Wizard's Vale, the Ents with all their rustling Huorns behind. We 
line 30242=>could  not see them, of course,  but the whole air  was full of creaking. It 
line 30243=>was very dark, a  cloudy  night. They moved at a great speed as soon as they 
line 30244=>had left  the hills,  and made a noise like a rushing wind. The Moon did not 
line 30245=>appear through the clouds, and  not long after midnight there was a tall wood 
line 30246=>all round  the north side of Isengard. There was  no  sign of enemies nor of 
line 30247=>any  challenge. There was a light gleaming from  a high window in the tower, 
line 30248=>that was all. 
line 30249=>     'Treebeard and a few more Ents crept  on, right round to within sight of 
line 30250=>the great gates. Pippin  and I were with him. We were sitting on Treebeard's 
line 30251=>shoulders, and  I could feel the quivering tenseness  in  him. But even when 
line 30252=>they are roused, Ents can be very cautious and patient. They stood  still  as 
line 30253=>carved stones, breathing and listening. 
line 30254=>     'Then all at once there was  a tremendous stir. Trumpets blared and the 
line 30255=>walls of Isengard  echoed. We thought that we had  been discovered, and that 
line 30256=>battle was  going to  begin. But nothing of  the sort.  All Saruman's people 
line 30257=>were marching away. I  don't know much about this war, or about the 
line 30258=>Horsemen 
line 30259=>of Rohan, but Saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his 
line 30260=>men with one final blow. He emptied Isengard. I  saw  the  enemy go: endless 
line 30261=>lines  of marching Orcs; and troops  of  them mounted on  great wolves.  And 
line 30262=>there were battalions of Men, too. Many  of them carried torches, and in the 
line 30263=>flare I could see  their faces. Most of them were ordinary men,  rather tall 
line 30264=>and dark-haired, and grim but not particularly  evil -looking. But there were 
line 30265=>some  others that were  horrible: man-high, but  with goblin-faces,  sallow,  
line 30266=>leering,  squint-eyed.  Do  you  know,  they  reminded  me at  once of  that 
line 30267=>Southerner at Bree: only he was not  so obviously orc-like as  most of these 
line 30268=>were.' 
line 30269=>     'I  thought of him too,' said Aragorn.  'We had many of these half-orcs 
line 30270=>to deal with at Helm's  Deep. It seems plain  now that that Southerner was a  
line 30271=>
line 30272=>####-spy of Saruman's; but whether he was working  with the Black Riders,  or for 
line 30273=>Saruman alone, I do not know.  It is difficult with these  evil folk to know 
line 30274=>when they are in league, and when they are cheating one another.' 
line 30275=>     'Well, of all sorts together, there must have  been ten thousand at the 
line 30276=>very least,' said Merry.  'They took an hour to  pass out of the gates. Some 
line 30277=>went off down the highway  to the  Fords, and some turned  away µ  and  went 
line 30278=>eastward. A bridge has  been built down there, about  a mile away, where the 
line 30279=>river  runs in a very deep channel. You could see i t  now, if  you stood up. 
line 30280=>They were all singing with harsh voices, and laughing, making a hideous din. 
line 30281=>I thought things looked very black for Rohan. But Treebeard did not move. He 
line 30282=>said: 'My business is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.' 
line 30283=>     'But, though I could not see what was happening  in the dark, I believe 
line 30284=>that Huorns began to move south, as soon as the gates were shut again. Their 
line 30285=>business  was with Orcs I think.  They  were  far  down  the valley  in  the 
line 30286=>morning; or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldn't see through.  
line 30287=>     'As soon as Saruman had sent off all his army, our turn came. Treebeard 
line 30288=>put us down, and went up to the gates, and began hammering on the doors, and 
line 30289=>calling for Saruman. There was no answer, except arrows  and stones from the 
line 30290=>walls. But arrows are no  use against Ents. They hurt  them, of  course, and 
line 30291=>infuriate them:  like stinging flies. But an  Ent  can  be  stuck as full of 
line 30292=>orc-arrows  as  a pin -cushion,  and take no serious  harm.  They  cannot  be 
line 30293=>poisoned,  for one thing; and their skin seems to be very thick, and tougher  
line 30294=>than bark.  It takes a  very  heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously. They 
line 30295=>don't like axes. But there would have to be a great many axe -men to one Ent: 
line 30296=>a man  that hacks once at  an  Ent  never  gets a chance of a second blow. A 
line 30297=>punch from an Ent-fist crumples up iron like thin tin. 
line 30298=>     'When Treebeard had got a few  arrows  in  him, he began to warm up, to  
line 30299=>get positively "hasty", as he would say. He let  out a great hoom-hom, and a  
line 30300=>dozen more Ents came striding up. An angry Ent is terrifying. Their fingers,  
line 30301=>and  their toes,  just  freeze  on  to  rock;  and  they  tear  it  up  like 
line 30302=>bread-crust. It was like watching the work of  great tree-roots in a hundred 
line 30303=>years, all packed into a few moments. 
line 30304=>     'They pushed,  pulled,  tore,  shook,  and  hammered;  and  clang-bang, 
line 30305=>crash-crack,  in five minutes they had these huge gates just lying in  ruin; 
line 30306=>and  some were  already beginning to eat into  the walls,  like rabbits in a  
line 30307=>sand-pit. I don't know what Saruman thought was happening; but anyway he 
line 30308=>did 
line 30309=>
line 30310=>####-not know how to deal with it. His wizardry may have been falling off lately,  
line 30311=>of course;  but anyway  I think he has not much grit, not much plain courage 
line 30312=>alone in a tight place without a lot of  slaves and machines  and things, if 
line 30313=>you  know what I mean. Very different from old Gandalf. I wonder if his fame 
line 30314=>was not all along mainly due to his cleverness in settling at Isengard.' 
line 30315=>     'No,'  said  Aragorn. 'Once he was as  great as his fame made h im.  His 
line 30316=>knowledge  was deep,  his thought  was  subtle,  and his hands  marvellously  
line 30317=>skilled; and  he  had  a power  over the  minds of others. The wise he could 
line 30318=>persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still 
line 30319=>keeps. There are not  many in Middle-earth that I  should  say were safe, if 
line 30320=>they were  left  alone to talk with him,  even now  when he  has suffered  a  
line 30321=>defeat. Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has 
line 30322=>been laid bare, but very few others.' 
line 30323=>     'The Ents are safe,' said Pippin. 'He seems  at one  time to  have  got 
line 30324=>round them, but never again. And anyway  he did  not understand them; and he 
line 30325=>made  the great mistake of  leaving them out of his  calculations. He had no 
line 30326=>plan for them, and there was no time to make any, once they had set to work. 
line 30327=>As  soon  as  our  attack began,  the few remaining rats in Isengard started 
line 30328=>bolting through  every  hole that the Ents  made.  The Ents  let the Men go, 
line 30329=>after they had questioned them, two or three dozen only down  at this end. I 
line 30330=>don't think many orc-folk, of any size, escaped. Not  from the Huorns: there 
line 30331=>was a wood  full of them all round Isengard by  that time, as well as  those 
line 30332=>that had gone down the valley. 
line 30333=>     'When  the  Ents  had reduced a large part  of  the  southern walls  to 
line 30334=>rubbish,  and  what was  left of his people  had  bolted  and  deserted him, 
line 30335=>Saruman fled in a panic. He seems to have been at the gates when we arrived: 
line 30336=>I expect he came  to watch his splendid army march out. When the  Ents broke 
line 30337=>their  way in,  he  left in a hurry. They did not spot him at first. But the 
line 30338=>night had opened out, and there was a great light of stars, quite enough for  
line 30339=>Ents to see by,  and suddenly  Quickbeam  gave a  cry  "The tree-killer, the 
line 30340=>tree-killer!"  Quickbeam is a gentle creature, but he  hates Saruman all the 
line 30341=>more fiercely for that: his people suffered cruelly from orc-axes. He  leapt 
line 30342=>down the path from the inner gate, and he  can  move like a wind when  he is 
line 30343=>roused. There was a pale figure hurrying away  in and out of the  shadows of 
line 30344=>the pillars, and it had nearly reached the stairs  to the tower -door. But it 
line 30345=>was a near thing. Quickbeam was so hot after  him, that he was within a step 
line 30346=>or two of being caught and strangled when he slipped in through the door. 
line 30347=>
line 30348=>####-     'When Saruman  was  safe back in Orthanc, it was not long before he set 
line 30349=>some of  his precious machinery to work. By  that time there were  many Ents 
line 30350=>inside  Isengard: some  had followed Quickbeam, and others had burst in from 
line 30351=>the  north  and  east ; they were roaming  about and  doing a great  deal  of 
line 30352=>damage. Suddenly up came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over 
line 30353=>the  plain began to spout  and belch. Several of the Ents  got scorched  and 
line 30354=>blistered.  One of them,  Beechbone  I  think he was  called,  a  very  tall 
line 30355=>handsome Ent,  got caught in a spray of some  liquid fire and burned like  a  
line 30356=>torch: a horrible sight. 
line 30357=>     'That sent them mad. I thought that they had been really roused before; 
line 30358=>but  I  was wrong. I saw  what it was like at last.  It was staggering. They 
line 30359=>roared and boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to crack and fall at the  
line 30360=>mere noise of them. Merry  and  I lay on  the  ground and stuffed our cloaks 
line 30361=>into our ears. Round  and  round the  rock of Orthanc the Ents went striding 
line 30362=>and  storming like a howling gale, breaking pillars,  hurling avalanches  of 
line 30363=>boulders  down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air  like 
line 30364=>leaves.  The tower was in the  middle  of a spinning  whirlwind. I  saw iron 
line 30365=>posts  and blocks of  masonry go rocketing  up hundreds  of feet, and  smash 
line 30366=>against the windows  of Orthanc. But Treebeard kept his head. He had not had 
line 30367=>any burns, luckily. He  did not want  his  folk to hurt themselves in  their 
line 30368=>fury,  and  he  did  not  want  Saruman to  escape out of some hole  in  the  
line 30369=>confusion.   Many  of  the   Ents   were   hurling  themselves  against  the 
line 30370=>Orthanc-rock;  but that defeated  them.  It  is very  smooth  and hard. Some 
line 30371=>wizardry is in it, perhaps, older and stronger than  Saruman's.  Anyway they 
line 30372=>could  not get a grip on it, or make a crack in  it; and they  were bruising 
line 30373=>and wounding themselves against it. 'So Treebeard went out into the ring and 
line 30374=>shouted.  His  enormous voice  rose above  all the din.  There  was  a  dead 
line 30375=>silence, suddenly. In it we  heard a shrill  laugh from a high window in the 
line 30376=>tower.  That had a queer effect on the Ents. They had been boiling over; now 
line 30377=>they became cold, grim as  ice, and quiet.  They left the plain and gathered 
line 30378=>round Treebeard,  standing quite still.  He  spoke  to  them for a little in 
line 30379=>their own language; I think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his 
line 30380=>old head long before. Then they just faded silently away in  the grey light. 
line 30381=>Day was dawning by that time. 
line 30382=>     'They set a  watch on the tower,   I believe,  but  the watchers were so 
line 30383=>well hidden in  shadows  and kept so  still, that  I could not see them. The 
line 30384=>others went away north. All  that day they were busy, out of  sight. Most of 
line 30385=>
line 30386=>####-the time  we were left  alone. It  was a dreary day; and we wandered about a  
line 30387=>bit, though we kept out of the view of the windows of Orthanc, as much as we 
line 30388=>could: they stared at us so threateningly. A good deal of the time  we spent 
line 30389=>looking for something to eat. And also we sat and talked, wondering what was 
line 30390=>happening away south in Rohan,  and what had  become of all the rest  of our 
line 30391=>Company. Every  now  and  then we could hear in the distance the rattle  and 
line 30392=>fall of stone, and thudding noises echoing in the hills.  
line 30393=>     'In the afternoon we walked round the circle,  and  went  to have a look  
line 30394=>at what was going on. There was  a great shadowy  wood of Huorns at the head 
line 30395=>of the  valley, and  another round the northern wall. We  did not dare to go 
line 30396=>in. But there was a rending, tearing noise of work going on inside. Ents and 
line 30397=>Huorns were  digging great  pits  and  trenches, and making  great pools and 
line 30398=>dams, gathering all the waters of the Isen and every other spring and stream 
line 30399=>that they could find. We left them to it. 
line 30400=>     'At dusk Treebeard came back to the gate. He was humming a nd booming to 
line 30401=>himself, and seemed pleased. He stood and stretched  his great arms and legs 
line 30402=>and breathed deep. I asked him if he was tired. 
line 30403=>     ' "Tired?" he said, "tired? Well  no, not tired, but stiff.  I  need  a  
line 30404=>good  draught  of  Entwash.  We  have   worked  hard;   we  have  done  more 
line 30405=>stone-cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long 
line 30406=>year 
line 30407=>before. But it is nearly finished. When night falls do not  linger near this 
line 30408=>gate or in the  old tunnel! Water may come through-and it will be  foul water  
line 30409=>for a while, until all the filth  of Saruman  is washed away. Then  Isen can 
line 30410=>run clean  again." He began  to pull  down  a bit  more of  the walls,  in a  
line 30411=>leisurely sort of way, just to amuse himself. 
line 30412=>     'We were just  wondering where  it  wou ld  be  safe to lie and get some 
line 30413=>sleep, when the most amazing thing of all happened. There was the sound of a  
line 30414=>rider coming swiftly  up the road. Merry  and I lay quiet, and Treebeard hid 
line 30415=>himself in the shadows under the arch. Suddenly  a great horse came striding 
line 30416=>up, like a flash of silver. It was already dark. but I could see the rider's 
line 30417=>face clearly: it seemed to shine, and all his clothes were white. I just sat 
line 30418=>up, staring, with my mouth open. I tried to call out, and couldn't. 
line 30419=>     'There  was no  need.  He  halted  just by  us and looked down  at  us. 
line 30420=>'Gandalf!' I said  at last.  but my voice  was only  a whisper. Did he  say: 
line 30421=>"Hullo, Pippin! This is a pleasant surprise!"? No, indeed! He said: "Get up, 
line 30422=>you tom-fool  of a Took! Where, in the name of wonder, in  all  this ruin is 
line 30423=>
line 30424=>####-Treebeard? I want him. Quick!" 
line 30425=>     'Treebeard heard his voice  and  came out of the shadows  at once;  and 
line 30426=>there was a strange meeting. I was surprised, because neither of them seemed 
line 30427=>surprised at all.  Gandalf obviously  expected to find  Treebeard  here; and 
line 30428=>Treebeard  might almost have been loitering about near the  gates on purpose 
line 30429=>to  meet  him. Yet we  had  told  the old  Ent all  about  Moria. But then I 
line 30430=>remembered a queer look he gave us  at the time. I can only suppose that  he 
line 30431=>had  seen Gandalf or  had some  news of him, but would not say anything in a 
line 30432=>hurry. "Don't  be hasty" is  his motto; but nobody, not even Elves, will say 
line 30433=>much about Gandalf's movements when he is not there. 
line 30434=>     '"Hoom! Gandalf!" said Treebeard.  "I  am  glad  you have come. Wood and 
line 30435=>water, stock and stone, I can master; but there is a Wizard to manage here." 
line 30436=>     '"Treebeard," said Gandalf. "I need your help. You have done much,  but 
line 30437=>I need more. I have about ten thousand Orcs to manage." 
line 30438=>     'Then those two went off and had a council  together in some corner. It 
line 30439=>must have seemed very  hasty  to  Treebeard, for Gandalf was in a tremendous 
line 30440=>hurry, and was already talking  at a great  pace,  before they passed out of 
line 30441=>hearing.  They were only away a matter of minutes, perhaps  a quarter  of an 
line 30442=>hour. Then Gandalf came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. He 
line 30443=>did say he was glad to see us, then. 
line 30444=>     '"But Gandalf," I cried, "where have you  been?  And have you seen  the 
line 30445=>others?" 
line 30446=>     '"Wherever  I have been, I am back,"  he answered in the genuine Gandalf 
line 30447=>manner. "Yes, I have seen some of the others. But news must wait.  This is a  
line 30448=>perilous night,  and I  must ride fast. But the dawn may be brighter; and if 
line 30449=>so, we shall  meet  again.  Take  care  of  yourselves,  and keep away  from 
line 30450=>Orthanc! Good-bye!" 
line 30451=>     'Treebeard was very thoughtful after Gandalf had gone. He had evidently 
line 30452=>learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it. He looked at us and said: 
line 30453=>"Hm, well, I find you are not such  hasty  folk as I thought. You  said much 
line 30454=>less than you might, and  not more than you should. Hm, this is  a bundle of 
line 30455=>news and no mistake! Well, now Treebeard must get busy again." 
line 30456=>     'Before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it  did not cheer  
line 30457=>us  up at all. But for the moment we thought more about you three than about 
line 30458=>Frodo and Sam, or about poor Boromir. For we gathered that there was a great 
line 30459=>battle going on, or soon would be, and that  you were in it, and might never  
line 30460=>come out of it. 
line 30461=>
line 30462=>####-     '"Huorns will help,"  said Treebeard. Then he went  away and we did not  
line 30463=>see him again until this morning. 
line 30464=>     'It was deep night. We lay  on  top of a pile  of stone,  and could see 
line 30465=>nothing beyond  it.  Mist  or shadows  blotted out  everything like  a great 
line 30466=>blanket  all  round us. The air seemed hot and  heavy; and it  was  full  of 
line 30467=>rustlings,  creakings,  and  a  murmur  like voices  passing. I  think  that 
line 30468=>hundreds more of the Huorns must have been passing by to help in the battle. 
line 30469=>Later  there was  a  great  rumble  of  thunder away south, and  flashes  of 
line 30470=>lightning   far  away  across  Rohan.  Every  now  and  then  we  could  see 
line 30471=>mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab  out suddenly,  black  and white, 
line 30472=>and then vanish. And behind us there were  noises like thunder in hills, but 
line 30473=>different. At times the whole valley echoed. 
line 30474=>     'It  must have been  about midnight when  the Ents broke  the  dams and 
line 30475=>poured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall, down into 
line 30476=>Isengard. The  Huorn-dark had passed,  and the  thunder had rolled away. The 
line 30477=>Moon was sinking behind the western mountains.  
line 30478=>     'Isengard began to fill up with black  creeping streams and pools. They 
line 30479=>glittered  in the  last  light of the Moon,  as  they spread over the plain. 
line 30480=>Every now and  then the waters  found their  way down  into  some  shaft  or  
line 30481=>spouthole. Great  white steams hissed up. Smoke rose in billows.  There were 
line 30482=>explosions and gusts  of fire. One great  coil of  vapour  went whirling up, 
line 30483=>twisting round and round Orthanc, until it looked like a tall peak of cloud, 
line 30484=>fiery underneath and moonlit above. And still more water poured in, until at 
line 30485=>last Isengard looked like a huge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling.' 
line 30486=>     'We saw  a cloud of smoke and steam from  the  south last night when we 
line 30487=>came to the mouth of Nan Curunnr,' said Aragorn. 'We feared that Saruman 
line 30488=>was 
line 30489=>brewing some new devilry for us.' 
line 30490=>     'Not he!' said Pippin. 'He was probably  choking and  not laughing  any 
line 30491=>more. By  the morning, yesterday morning, the water  had sunk down  into all 
line 30492=>the holes,  and there was a dense fog. We took refuge in that guardroom over 
line 30493=>there; and we had  rather a fright. The lake began  to overflow and pour out 
line 30494=>through the old  tunnel,  and the  water was rapidly rising up the steps. We 
line 30495=>thought we were  going to get caught  like  Orcs in a  hole; but we  found a  
line 30496=>winding stair at the back of  the  store-room that brought  us out on top of 
line 30497=>the arch. It was a squeeze to get  out, as the passages had been cracked and 
line 30498=>half blocked with fallen stone  near the top. There  we sat high up above the 
line 30499=>
line 30500=>####-floods  and watched the drowning of Isengard. The  Ents kept  on pouring  in 
line 30501=>more water, till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled. The fogs 
line 30502=>slowly gathered together  and steamed up into  a huge umbrella of  cloud: it 
line 30503=>must have been  a mile high. In the evening there  was a great rainbow  over  
line 30504=>the eastern hills; and then the sunset was blotted out by a thick drizzle on 
line 30505=>the mountain-sides. It  all went very quiet. A few wolves howled mournfully, 
line 30506=>far away. The Ents stopped the  inflow in the  night, and sent the Isen back  
line 30507=>into its old course. And that was the end of it all. 
line 30508=>     'Since then  the water has  been sinking  again. There  must be outlets 
line 30509=>somewhere from the caves underneath, I think. If Saruman peeps out of any of 
line 30510=>his  windows, it must look an untidy, dreary mess. We  felt very lonely. Not  
line 30511=>even  a visible Ent  to talk to in all the ruin;  and no  news. We spent the 
line 30512=>night up on top there above the arch,  and it was cold and  damp and we  did 
line 30513=>not sleep.  We  had a feeling  that anything  might  happen  at  any minute. 
line 30514=>Saruman  is  still in his tower. There was a noise in the  night like a wind 
line 30515=>coming  up the valley. I think the Ents  and Huorns that had been away  came 
line 30516=>back  then; but where they have all gone to  now, I  don't  know. It  was  a  
line 30517=>misty,  moisty morning  when we  climbed down  and  looked  round again, 
line 30518=>and 
line 30519=>nobody was about. And that is  about all there  is  to tell. It seems almost 
line 30520=>peaceful  now after all  the turmoil. And safer too, somehow,  since Gandalf 
line 30521=>came back. I could sleep!' 
line 30522=>     They  all fell silent  for a while. Gimli re-filled his pipe. 'There is 
line 30523=>one thing I wonder about,' he  said as he lit it with his  flint and tinder: 
line 30524=>'Wormtongue. You told Thjoden he was with Saruman. How did he get there?' 
line 30525=>     'Oh yes,  I forgot about him,'  said Pippin. 'He did not get here  till 
line 30526=>this morning. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when Treebeard 
line 30527=>appeared again. We heard him hooming and calling our names outside. 
line 30528=>     '"I have just come round to see how  you are faring, my lads,' he said; 
line 30529=>'and to give you some news. Huorns have come back. All's well; aye very well 
line 30530=>indeed!" he laughed, and slapped his  thighs. "No more Orcs  in Isengard, no 
line 30531=>more axes! And there will be folk  coming up from the South before the day is 
line 30532=>old; some that you may be glad to see." 
line 30533=>     'He had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road. 
line 30534=>We rushed out  before the gates, and  I stood and stared,  half expecting to 
line 30535=>see Strider  and Gandalf come riding up at the head of  an army. But  out of 
line 30536=>the  mist there  rode a man on  an old tired  horse; and he  looked  a queer  
line 30537=>
line 30538=>####-twisted sort of creature  himself. There was no one  else. When he came. out 
line 30539=>of the  mist and suddenly saw  all the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he 
line 30540=>sat and gaped, and his face went almost green. He was so bewildered that  he 
line 30541=>did not seem to notice us at first. When he did, he gave a cry, and tried to 
line 30542=>turn his horse round and ride off. But Treebeard took three strides,  put out 
line 30543=>a long  arm, and  lifted him out  of the saddle. His horse bolted in terror, 
line 30544=>and he grovelled  on the ground. He said he was Grnma, friend and counsellor  
line 30545=>of  the  king,  and had  been sent  with important messages  from Thjoden to 
line 30546=>Saruman. 
line 30547=>     '"No one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full of foul 
line 30548=>Orcs," he said,  "so I was sent. And I have had a perilous journey, and I am 
line 30549=>hungry and weary. I fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves." 
line 30550=>     'I caught the sidelong looks he gave to Treebeard, and I said to myself 
line 30551=>"liar".  Treebeard looked at him in  his long slow  way for several minutes, 
line 30552=>till the wretched man was squirming on the floor. Then at last he said: "Ha, 
line 30553=>hm, I was expecting  you, Master Wormtongue." The man  started a t that name. 
line 30554=>"Gandalf got  here first. So I know as much about you  as I need, and I know 
line 30555=>what to do with you. Put all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will. 
line 30556=>I am the master of Isengard now, but Saruman is locked in his tower; and you 
line 30557=>can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of." 
line 30558=>     '"Let me go, let me go!" said Wormtongue. "I know the way." 
line 30559=>     '"You knew the way, I  don't doubt,"  said Treebeard. "But  things have 
line 30560=>changed here a little. Go and see!" 
line 30561=>     'He let Wormtongue go, and he limped off through the arch with us close  
line 30562=>behind, until he came inside  the ring and could see all the floods that lay 
line 30563=>between him and Orthanc. Then he turned to us. 
line 30564=>     '"Let me go away!" he whined. "Let  me go away! My messages are useless 
line 30565=>now." 
line 30566=>     '"They are indeed," said Treebeard. "But you have only two  choices: to 
line 30567=>stay  with me until  Gandalf and your master arrive; or to  cross the water. 
line 30568=>Which will you have?" 
line 30569=>     'The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot into the 
line 30570=>water; but he drew back. "I cannot swim," he said. 
line 30571=>     '"The  water is not deep," said Treebeard. "It is dirty,  but that will 
line 30572=>not harm you, Master Wormtongue. In you go now!" 
line 30573=>     'With that the wretch  floundered off into the flood. It rose up nearly 
line 30574=>to his neck before  he got too far away for me to see him. The last I saw of 
line 30575=>
line 30576=>####-him was clinging to some old barrel or  piece of  wood. But  Treebeard waded 
line 30577=>after him, and watched his progress.  
line 30578=>     '"Well, he has gone in," he said when he returned. "I saw  him crawling 
line 30579=>up  the steps like a draggled  rat. There is someone  in  the tower still: a  
line 30580=>hand came out and pulled him in. So there he is, and I  hope  the welcome is 
line 30581=>to  his liking. Now  I  must go and wash myself clean  of the slime. I'll be 
line 30582=>away  up on the north side,  if anyone wants to see  me. There  is no  clean 
line 30583=>water down here  fit for an  Ent to drink. or to bathe in. So I will ask you  
line 30584=>two lads to keep a watch at  the gate for the folk that are coming. There'll 
line 30585=>be the Lord of the Fields of Rohan, mark you! You must welcome  him as  well 
line 30586=>as you know how: his men have fought a great fight with the Orcs. Maybe, you  
line 30587=>know the right fashion  of Men's words  for such a  lord,  better than Ents.  
line 30588=>There have been many  lords in the green fields in my time, and I have never 
line 30589=>learned their speech or their  names. They will be wanting man-food, and you 
line 30590=>know all  about that, I guess.  So find what you think  is fit for a king to 
line 30591=>eat,  if you can." And that is the end of the story. Though I should like to 
line 30592=>know who this Wormtongue is. Was he really the king's counsellor?' 
line 30593=>     'He was,' said  Aragorn; 'and also  Saruman's spy and servant in Rohan. 
line 30594=>Fate has not been  kinder to him than he deserves. The sight of the  ruin of 
line 30595=>all  that  he  thought  so  strong and  magnificent  must  have  been almost 
line 30596=>punishment enough. But I fear that worse awaits him.' 
line 30597=>     'Yes, I  don't suppose Treebeard sent him to Orthanc out of  kindness,' 
line 30598=>said Merry.  'He seemed rather grimly delighted  with the business  and  was 
line 30599=>laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. We spent a busy 
line 30600=>time after that, searching the flotsam, and rummaging about. We found two or  
line 30601=>three  store-rooms  in different  places nearby,  above the flood-level. But 
line 30602=>Treebeard  sent  some  Ents down, and they  carried off  a great deal of the 
line 30603=>stuff. 
line 30604=>     '"We want man-food for twenty-five," the Ents said, so you can see that 
line 30605=>somebody  had  counted your  company carefully before you arrived. You three 
line 30606=>were  evidently meant to go  with the  great people. But you  would  not have  
line 30607=>fared any better. We kept as good as we sent, I promise you. Better, because 
line 30608=>we sent no drink. 
line 30609=>     '"What about drink?" I said to the Ents.  
line 30610=>     '"There is water of Isen," they said, "and that is good enough for Ents 
line 30611=>and Men." But I hope that the Ents may have found time to brew some of their 
line 30612=>draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see Gandalf's beard curling 
line 30613=>
line 30614=>####-when he returns. After the Ents had gone, we felt tired,  and hungry. But we 
line 30615=>did not grumble  -- our labours  had  been well rewarded. It was through our  
line 30616=>search  for  man-food that Pippin  discovered the prize of  all the flotsam, 
line 30617=>those  Hornblower  barrels.  "Pipe-weed  is better after food," said Pippin; 
line 30618=>that is how the situation arose.' 
line 30619=>     'We understand it all perfectly now,' said Gimli. 
line 30620=>     'All except one thing,' said  Aragorn: 'leaf  from the Southfarthing in 
line 30621=>Isengard.  The more  I consider it, the more curious I find it. I have never  
line 30622=>been in Isengard,  but I have journeyed  in this  land, and I know  well the 
line 30623=>empty countries that lie between Rohan and the Shire. Neither goods nor folk 
line 30624=>have passed that  way for  many a long year, not openly. Saruman  had secret 
line 30625=>dealings with someone  in  the Shire, I  guess. Wormtongues may  be found in 
line 30626=>other houses than King Thjoden's. Was there a date on the barrels?' 
line 30627=>     'Yes,' said Pippin. 'It was the 1417 crop, that is last year's; no, the 
line 30628=>year before, of course, now: a good year.' 
line 30629=>     'Ah well, whatever evil  was  afoot is over now, I  hope; or else it is 
line 30630=>beyond our reach  at pr esent,' said Aragorn. 'Yet I think I shall mention it 
line 30631=>to Gandalf, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.' 
line 30632=>     'I wonder what he is doing,' said Merry. 'The  afternoon is getting on. 
line 30633=>Let us go and look round! You can enter Isengard now at  any rate,  Strider,  
line 30634=>if you want to. But it is not a very cheerful sight.'

line 30640=>
line 30641=> 
line 30642=> 
line 30643=>     They passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of  stones, 
line 30644=>gazing at the  dark rock of Orthanc, and its many windows, a menace still in 
line 30645=>the  desolation  that  lay  all about  it.  The waters  had  now  nearly all 
line 30646=>subsided.  Here  and  there  gloomy pools  remained,  covered with  scum and 
line 30647=>wreckage; but most of the wide circle was bare again, a  wilderness of slime 
line 30648=>and tumbled  rock, pitted with  blackened holes, and  dotted  with posts and 
line 30649=>pillars  leaning  drunkenly this  way and that. At the rim of the  shattered 
line 30650=>bowl  there lay vast mounds and slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great 
line 30651=>storm; and  beyond them the  green and  tangled valley  ran up into the long  
line 30652=>ravine  between the  dark arms  of  the mountains. Across the waste they saw 
line 30653=>riders picking their way; they were coming from the north  side, and already 
line 30654=>they were drawing near to Orthanc. 
line 30655=>     'There is  Gandalf, and Thjoden and his men!' said Legolas. 'Let  us go 
line 30656=>and meet them!' 
line 30657=>     'Walk warily!' said Merry. 'There are loose  slabs that may tilt up and 
line 30658=>throw you down into a pit, if you don't take care.' 
line 30659=>     They  followed what was  left of  the road from  the gates  to Orthanc, 
line 30660=>going slowly,  for  the flag-stones  were cracked  and  slimed.  The riders,  
line 30661=>seeing them approach, halted under the  shadow of  the  rock and  waited for  
line 30662=>them. Gandalf rode forward to meet them. 
line 30663=>     'Well, Treebeard and I have had some interesting  discussions, and made 
line 30664=>a few plans,' he said; 'and we have  all had  some much-needed  rest. Now we 
line 30665=>must  be going  on again.  I hope  you companions  have all rested, too, and 
line 30666=>refreshed yourselves?' 
line 30667=>     'We have,' said Merry. 'But  our discussions began and ended in  smoke. 
line 30668=>Still we feel less ill-disposed towards Saruman than we did.' 
line 30669=>     'Do you indeed?' said Gandalf.  'Well, I do not. I have now a last task  
line 30670=>to do  before I  go: I must pay Saruman  a  farewell visit.  Dangerous,  and 
line 30671=>probably  u seless; but it must be done.  Those of you who wish may come with 
line 30672=>me -- but beware! And do not jest! This is not the time for it.' 
line 30673=>     'I will  come,' said Gimli. 'I wish to see him and  learn  if he really 
line 30674=>looks like you.' 
line 30675=>     'And how will you learn  that,  Master Dwarf?'  said  Gandalf. 'Saruman 
line 30676=>
line 30677=>####-could  look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. And are 
line 30678=>you yet wise enough  to detect  all  his  counterfeits? Well, we shall  see, 
line 30679=>perhaps.  He  may  be  shy  of  showing himself before many  different  eyes 
line 30680=>together. But I have ordered all  the Ents to remove  themselves from sight, 
line 30681=>so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out.' 
line 30682=>     'What's the danger?' asked Pippin. 'Will he shoot at  us, and pour fire 
line 30683=>out of the windows; or can he put a spell on us from a distance?' 
line 30684=>     'The last is most likely, if you ride to his door with a light  heart,' 
line 30685=>said Gandalf. 'But there is no knowing what he can do, or may choose to try.  
line 30686=>A wild beast cornered is not safe to approach. And Saruman has powers you do 
line 30687=>not guess. Beware of his voice!' 
line 30688=>     They  came  now to  the foot of Orthanc.  It  was black, and  the  rock  
line 30689=>gleamed as if it were wet. The  many  faces of the  stone had sharp edges as 
line 30690=>though they had been newly chiselled. A  few  scorings. and small flake-like 
line 30691=>splinters near the base, were all the marks that it bore of the fury  of the 
line 30692=>Ents. 
line 30693=>     On the eastern side, in the angle of two piers, there was a great door, 
line 30694=>high above the  ground; and over it was a  shuttered window, opening upon  a 
line 30695=>balcony hedged with iron bars. Up to the threshold of the door there mounted 
line 30696=>a flight of twenty-seven broad stairs, hewn  by some unknown art of the same 
line 30697=>black stone. This was the only entrance to the tower;  but many tall windows 
line 30698=>were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like 
line 30699=>little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns. 
line 30700=>     At the  foot of the  stairs Gandalf and the king dismounted. 'I will go 
line 30701=>up,' said Gandalf. 'I have been in Orthanc and I know my peril.' 
line 30702=>     'And I too will go up,' said the king. 'I am old, and fear no peril any 
line 30703=>more.  I wish to speak with the enemy who has  done me so  much wrong. 
line 30704=>Jomer 
line 30705=>shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.' 
line 30706=>     'As you  will,' said  Gandalf. 'Aragorn shall  come with  me.  Let  the 
line 30707=>others await us at the foot of the stairs. They will hear and see enough, if 
line 30708=>there is anything to hear or see.' 
line 30709=>     'Nay!' said Gimli. 'Legolas and I wish for a closer view. We alone here 
line 30710=>represent our kindred. We also will come behind.' 
line 30711=>     'Come  then!' said Gandalf, and  with that  he climbed the  steps,  and 
line 30712=>Thjoden went beside him. 
line 30713=>     The Riders of Rohan sat  uneasily upon their horses,  on either side of 
line 30714=>
line 30715=>####-the stair,  and  looked  up darkly  at  the great  tower, fearing what might 
line 30716=>befall their lord.  Merry and  Pippin  sat on the bottom step,  feeling both 
line 30717=>unimportant and unsafe. 
line 30718=>     'Half a sticky mile from here to the gate!' muttered Pippin.  'I wish I 
line 30719=>could slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed! What did we come for? We are 
line 30720=>not wanted.' 
line 30721=>     Gandalf stood before the door of Orthanc and beat on it with his staff.  
line 30722=>It  rang  with  a  hollow  sound.  'Saruman, Saruman!'  he  cried in a  loud 
line 30723=>commanding voice.  'Saruman come forth!' 
line 30724=>     For  some time there was no answer.  At  last the window above the door  
line 30725=>was unbarred, hut no figure could be seen at its dark opening. 
line 30726=>     'Who is it?' said a voice. 'What do you wish?' 
line 30727=>     Thjoden started.  'I know that  voice,' he said, 'and I  curse  the day 
line 30728=>when I first listened to it.' 
line 30729=>     'Go  and  fetch Saruman,  since  you  have  become  his footman,  Grnma  
line 30730=>Wormtongue!' said Gandalf.  'And do not waste our time!' 
line 30731=>     The window closed. They  waited.  Suddenly another voice spoke, low and 
line 30732=>melodious, its very sound  an enchantment.  Those who  listened  unwarily to 
line 30733=>that voice could seldom  report the words that they heard;  and if they did, 
line 30734=>they wondered,  for  little power remained  in them. Mostly they  remembered 
line 30735=>only that it was a delight to  hear the  voice  speaking, all  that it  said 
line 30736=>seemed wise and  reasonable, and desire awoke in them  by swift agreement to 
line 30737=>seem  wise themselves.  When others  spoke  they seemed harsh and uncouth 
line 30738=>by 
line 30739=>contrast; and if they gainsaid the voice, anger was kindled in the hearts of 
line 30740=>those under the spell. Fur some the spell lasted only while the voice  spoke 
line 30741=>to them, and when it spake to another they smiled, as men do who see through 
line 30742=>a  juggler's trick while others gape at it. For many the sound  of the voice 
line 30743=>alone was enough  to hold  them enthralled; but for those whom it  conquered 
line 30744=>the  spell endured when they were  far away. and ever  they heard that  soft  
line 30745=>voice whispering and  urging them. But none  were unmoved; none rejected its 
line 30746=>pleas and its commands without  an effort  of mind and will, so long as  its 
line 30747=>master had control of it.  
line 30748=>     'Well?' it  said now with  gentle  question. 'Why  must  you disturb my 
line 30749=>rest? Will you give me no peace  at  all by night or day?' Its tone was that 
line 30750=>of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved. 
line 30751=>     They  looked up, astonished, for they had heard no sound of his coming; 
line 30752=>
line 30753=>####-and they saw a figure standing at the  rail, looking  down upon them: an old 
line 30754=>man, swathed in a great cloak, the colour of which was not easy to tell, for  
line 30755=>it changed if they  moved  their eyes or if  he stirred. His  face was long, 
line 30756=>with  a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the 
line 30757=>look  that they now  bore was grave and benevolent, and a  little weary. His 
line 30758=>hair and beard were white, but strands of black still showed about his  lips 
line 30759=>and ears. 
line 30760=>     'Like, and yet unlike,' muttered Gimli. 
line 30761=>     'But come now,' said the  soft voice. 'Two  at least of  you I know  by 
line 30762=>name.  Gandalf  I know too  well to  have much  hope that  he seeks help  or  
line 30763=>counsel here. But you, Thjoden Lord  of  the Mark  of Rohan are  declared by 
line 30764=>your noble devices, and still more by  the fair  countenance of the House of 
line 30765=>Eorl.  O worthy son of  Thengel the  Thrice-renowned! Why have you not  
line 30766=>come 
line 30767=>before, and as a friend? Much  have  I desired to see you, mightiest king of 
line 30768=>western lands, and especially  in these latter years, to  save you from  the 
line 30769=>unwise and evil counsels that beset  you!  Is it yet  too late? Despite  the 
line 30770=>injuries that have been done to me, in  which the  men of Rohan, alas!  have 
line 30771=>had some part, still  I  would save you, and deliver you from the ruin  that 
line 30772=>draws nigh inevitably,  if you  ride  upon this  road which you have  taken. 
line 30773=>Indeed I alone can aid you now.' 
line 30774=>     Thjoden opened his mouth as if to speak, but he said nothing. He looked 
line 30775=>up  at the face of Saruman with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and 
line 30776=>then to Gandalf at his  side; and  he  seemed to hesitate. Gandalf  made  no  
line 30777=>sign; but stood silent as stone, as one waiting patiently for some call that 
line 30778=>has not  yet  come. The Riders stirred at first, murmuring with approval  of 
line 30779=>the words of Saruman; and then they too were silent,  as men spell-bound. It  
line 30780=>seemed to them that Gandalf had never spoken so  fair and fittingly to their 
line 30781=>lord.  Rough and proud  now seemed all his  dealings with  Thjoden. And over  
line 30782=>their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the Mark 
line 30783=>in a  darkness to which Gandalf was driving them, while Saruman stood beside 
line 30784=>a door of  escape, holding it half open so that a ray of light came through. 
line 30785=>There was a heavy silence. 
line 30786=>     It was Gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenly. 'The words of this wizard 
line 30787=>stand on their heads,'  he growled, gripping  the handle of his axe. 'In the 
line 30788=>language  of  Orthanc  help  means ruin, and  saving means  slaying, that is 
line 30789=>plain. But we do not come here to beg.' 
line 30790=>
line 30791=>####-     'Peace!'  said Saruman, and for  a  fleeting  moment his voice was less 
line 30792=>suave, and a  light flickered in his eyes and was gone.  'I do not  speak to 
line 30793=>you  yet,  Gimli  Gluin's son,' he said. 'Far  away  is  your home and small 
line 30794=>concern of yours are the  troubles of this land. But it was not by design of 
line 30795=>your own that  you  became  embroiled in them, and so I will  not blame such 
line 30796=>part as you have played-a valiant one, I doubt not. But I pray you, allow me  
line 30797=>first to speak with the King of Rohan, my neighbour, and once my friend. 
line 30798=>     'What  have you to say,  Thjoden King? Will you have peace with me, and 
line 30799=>all  the aid that my  knowledge, founded in  long years, can bring? Shall we 
line 30800=>make our counsels together  against  evil days, and repair our injuries with 
line 30801=>such good will that our  estates  shall both come to fairer flower than ever 
line 30802=>before?' 
line 30803=>     Still Thjoden  did not  answer.  Whether he strove with anger or  doubt 
line 30804=>none could say. Jomer spoke. 
line 30805=>     'Lord, hear me!'  he said.  'Now  we feel the peril that we  were warned 
line 30806=>of. Have we ridden forth to victory, only to stand at last amazed  by an old 
line 30807=>liar with honey on his forked tongue? So would the trapped wolf speak to the 
line 30808=>hounds,  if he could. What aid can he give  to you, forsooth? All he desires 
line 30809=>is  to  escape  from  his plight. But will you  parley  with this dealer  in 
line 30810=>treachery and murder? Remember Thjodred at  the Fords, and the grave of 
line 30811=>Hbma  
line 30812=>in Helm's Deep!' 
line 30813=>     'If  we speak of  poisoned tongues what  shall  we say of  yours, young 
line 30814=>serpent?' said Saruman,  and the  flash of  his  anger was now plain to see. 
line 30815=>'But  come,  Jomer, Jomund's  son!' he went on in his soft  voice again.  To 
line 30816=>every man h part. Valour in  arms is yours, and you win high honour thereby. 
line 30817=>Slay whom your lord names as enemies, and be content. Meddle not in policies 
line 30818=>which you do not understand. But maybe. if you become  a king, you Will find 
line 30819=>that he must choose his friends with care. The friendship of Saruman and the 
line 30820=>power  of Orthanc  cannot be lightly thrown aside, whatever grievances, real 
line 30821=>or fancied, may lie behind. You have won  a battle  but  not a  war and that 
line 30822=>with help on  which you cannot count again.  You may  find the Shadow of the 
line 30823=>Wood at your  own door next:  it is wayward, and senseless, and  has no love 
line 30824=>for Men. 
line 30825=>     'But  my  lord of  Rohan, am I to be called a murderer, because valiant 
line 30826=>men have fallen in battle?  If  you go to war,  needlessly,  for  I did  not 
line 30827=>desire  it, then men will be slain. But  if I am a murderer on that account, 
line 30828=>
line 30829=>####-then all the House of Eorl is stained with murder; for they have fought many 
line 30830=>wars, and assailed many who defied  them. Yet with some they have afterwards 
line 30831=>made peace, none the worse for being politic. I say, Thjoden King:  shall we 
line 30832=>have peace and friendship, you and I? It is ours to command ' 
line 30833=>     'We will have peace,' said Thjoden  at last thickly and with an effort. 
line 30834=>Several of the  Riders  cried out gladly. Thjoden held up his hand. 'Yes, we 
line 30835=>will have peace,'  he said, now in a clear voice,  'we will have peace, when 
line 30836=>you and all your works have perished -- and the works of your dark master to 
line 30837=>whom you would deliver us. You are a liar. Saruman, and a corrupter of men's 
line 30838=>hearts.  You hold out your hand to me,  and  I perceive only a finger of the 
line 30839=>claw of  Mordor. Cruel  and cold! Even if your war on me was just as  it was 
line 30840=>not, for were you ten times as wise you  would have no right  to rule me and 
line 30841=>mine  for your own profit  as  you desired  --  even so, what will you say of 
line 30842=>your torches in Westfold  and  the children  that lie dead  there?  And they 
line 30843=>hewed Hbma's body before the gates of the Hornburg, after he  was dead. 
line 30844=>When 
line 30845=>you hang from  a  gibbet at  your  window for the sport of your own crows, I 
line 30846=>will have peace with you and  Orthanc.  So  much  for  the House  of  Eorl. A 
line 30847=>lesser son of great sires am I, but I do not need to lick your fingers. Turn 
line 30848=>elsewhither. But I fear your voice has lost its charm.' 
line 30849=>     The Riders gazed up at Thjoden like men startled  out of a dream. Harsh 
line 30850=>as an old raven's their master's  voice sounded in their ears after the music 
line 30851=>of Saruman. But Saruman for a while was beside himself with wrath. He leaned 
line 30852=>over the rail as if he would smite the King with his staff. To some suddenly 
line 30853=>it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike. 
line 30854=>     'Gibbets  and crows!'  he  hissed,  and they shuddered  at  the hideous 
line 30855=>change.  'Dotard!  What is  the house of  Eorl but  a  thatched  barn  where 
line 30856=>brigands  drink  in the reek,  and  their brats roll on the floor among  the 
line 30857=>dogs? Too long have they escaped the gibbet themselves. But the noose comes,  
line 30858=>slow in the  drawing,  tight and hard in the end. Hang if you will!' Now his 
line 30859=>voice changed, as he slowly mastered himself. 'I know not why I have had the 
line 30860=>patience  to speak  to you.  For I need  you not, nor  your  little band  of 
line 30861=>gallopers,  as swift to fly  as to  advance, Thjoden Horsemaster. Long ago I 
line 30862=>offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit. I have offered it again, 
line 30863=>so that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads. You give 
line 30864=>me brag and abuse. So be it. Go back to your huts!  
line 30865=>     'But you, Gandalf!  For  you  at  least I am grieved,  feeling for your 
line 30866=>
line 30867=>####-shame. How comes  it  that you  can  endure such company? For you are proud, 
line 30868=>Gandalf-and not  without reason, having a noble mind and eyes that look both 
line 30869=>deep and far. Even now will you not listen to my counsel?' 
line 30870=>     Gandalf stirred, and looked up. 'What have you to say that you did  not 
line 30871=>say at our last meeting?' he asked. 'Or, perhaps, you have things to unsay?' 
line 30872=>     Saruman paused. 'Unsay?' he mused, as if puzzled. 'Unsay? I endeavoured 
line 30873=>to advise you for your own good, but  you scarcely listened. You  are  proud 
line 30874=>and  do not love advice,  having  indeed  a store of your own wisdom. But on 
line 30875=>that occasion  you erred, I think, misconstruing my  intentions wilfully.  I 
line 30876=>fear that in my eagerness to persuade you, I  lost  patience.  And  indeed I 
line 30877=>regret it. For I bore you no ill-will; and even now  I bear none, though you  
line 30878=>return to me in the company  of the violent and  the ignorant. How should I?  
line 30879=>Are  we not both members of  a high  and  ancient order, most  excellent  in 
line 30880=>Middle-earth? Our friendship would profit us both alike. Much we could still 
line 30881=>accomplish together, to heal the disorders of the  world.  Let us understand 
line 30882=>one another,  and  dismiss from thought these lesser folk! Let  them wait on 
line 30883=>our decisions! For the common good I am  willing to redress the past, and to 
line 30884=>receive you. Will you not consult with me? Will you not come up?' 
line 30885=>     So  great was the power that Saruman  exerted in this  last effort that 
line 30886=>none that stood  within hearing were unmoved. But  now the  spell was wholly 
line 30887=>different.  They  heard the  gentle remonstrance  of  a kindly  king with an 
line 30888=>erring but much-loved minister. But they were shut out, listening at a  door 
line 30889=>to  words  not  meant for  them: ill-mannered  children  or  stupid servants 
line 30890=>overhearing the  elusive discourse  of their  elders, and wondering  how  it 
line 30891=>would  affect their lot. Of  loftier mould these two were made: reverend and 
line 30892=>wise. It was inevitable that they should make alliance. Gandalf would ascend 
line 30893=>into  the  tower, to discuss  deep  things beyond their comprehension in the 
line 30894=>high chambers of  Orthanc. The door would be closed, and they would  be left  
line 30895=>outside, dismissed to await allotted work or punishment. Even in the mind of 
line 30896=>Thjoden the thought took shape, like a shadow of doubt: 'He will betray  us;  
line 30897=>he will go -- we shall be lost.' 
line 30898=>     Then Gandalf laughed. The fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke. 
line 30899=>     'Saruman, Saruman!' said Gandalf still  laughing.  'Saruman, you  missed 
line 30900=>your path  in life. You  should have been the king's jester  and earned your 
line 30901=>bread, and stripes  too, by  mimicking  his counsellors. Ah me!'  he paused, 
line 30902=>getting the better of his mirth. 'Understand one another? I fear I am beyond 
line 30903=>your comprehension. But you, Saruman, I understand  now too well.  I keep  a  
line 30904=>
line 30905=>####-clearer memory of your arguments, and deeds, than  you  suppose. When last I 
line 30906=>visited you, you were the jailor of Mordor, and there I was to be sent. Nay, 
line 30907=>the guest who has escaped from the roof,  will think  twice  before he comes 
line 30908=>back  in  by the door.  Nay,  I do  not think  I  will come  up. But listen, 
line 30909=>Saruman, for the last time! Will you not come down? Isengard has proved less 
line 30910=>strong than  your hope  and fancy made it. So may other  things in which you 
line 30911=>still have trust.  Would it not be well to leave it for  a while? To turn to 
line 30912=>new things, perhaps? Think well, Saruman! Will you not come down?' 
line 30913=>     A shadow passed over Saruman's face; then it went deathly white. Before 
line 30914=>he could  conceal  it, they saw  through the mask the anguish of  a  mind in 
line 30915=>doubt, loathing to  stay and dreading to leave  its refuge. For a second  he 
line 30916=>hesitated, and no one breathed. Then he spoke,  and his voice was shrill and  
line 30917=>cold. Pride and hate were conquering him. 
line 30918=>     'Will I come down?' he mocked. 'Does an unarmed man come down to  
line 30919=>speak 
line 30920=>with  robbers out of doors? I can  hear you w ell enough here. I am no fool, 
line 30921=>and I do not trust you, Gandalf. They  do not stand openly on my stairs, but 
line 30922=>I know where the wild wood-demons are lurking, at your command.' 
line 30923=>     'The treacherous are ever distrustful,' answered  Gandalf wearily. 'But 
line 30924=>you need not fear for your skin.  I do not wish to kill you, or hurt you, as 
line 30925=>you would know, if you really understood me. And I have the power to protect 
line 30926=>you. I  am giving you  a last chance. You can leave Orthanc, free --  if you  
line 30927=>choose.' 
line 30928=>     'That sounds  well,' sneered Saruman.  'Very  much  in  the  manner  of 
line 30929=>Gandalf  the Grey: so condescending, and  so very  kind. I do not doubt that 
line 30930=>you would find Orthanc  commodious,  and  my  departure convenient. But  
line 30931=>why 
line 30932=>should  I  wish  to  leave?  And  what  do you  mean  by  'free'?  There are 
line 30933=>conditions, I presume?' 
line 30934=>     'Reasons for leaving you can see from your  windows.' answered Gandalf. 
line 30935=>'Others  will  occur to  your  thought.  Your  servants  are  destroyed  and 
line 30936=>scattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you  have cheated 
line 30937=>your new  master. or tried to do so. When his eye turns  hither,  it will be 
line 30938=>the red eye of wrath. But when I say  'free',  I mean  'free': free from bond, 
line 30939=>of chain or command: to go where you will, even, even to Mordor, Saruman, if 
line 30940=>you desire. But  you will first surrender to me the Key of Orthanc, and your 
line 30941=>staff. They shall be pledges of your conduct, to be returned later,  if  you  
line 30942=>
line 30943=>####-merit them.' 
line 30944=>     Saruman's face  grew  livid, twisted  with rage,  and a  red light  was 
line 30945=>kindled in his eyes.  He  laughed wildly. 'Later!' he  cried, and his  voice 
line 30946=>rose to a scream.  'Later! Yes,  when you  also  have the Keys  of Barad-dyr 
line 30947=>itself, I suppose; and the crowns of  seven kings. and the rods of  the Five 
line 30948=>Wizards, and have purchased yourself a pair  of boots many sizes larger than 
line 30949=>those  that you  wear now.  A modest plan.  Hardly one in which  my help  is 
line 30950=>needed! I have other things to do. Do not be a fool. If you  wish  to  treat 
line 30951=>with me, while you have a chance, go away, and come back when you are 
line 30952=>sober! 
line 30953=>And leave behind  these cut-throats and small  rag-tag that  dangle at  your 
line 30954=>tail! Good day!' He turned and left the balcony. 
line 30955=>     'Come back,  Saruman!' said  Gandalf  in  a  commanding  voice. To  the  
line 30956=>amazement of the others, Saruman turned again. and as if dragged against his 
line 30957=>will, he  came slowly back to the  iron rail, leaning on it, breathing hard. 
line 30958=>His  face was lined and  shrunken.  His hand clutched  his heavy black staff 
line 30959=>like a claw. 
line 30960=>     'I did  not give you leave to  go,'  said Gandalf sternly. 'I have  not 
line 30961=>finished. You have become a fool, Saruman, and yet pitiable. You might still 
line 30962=>have turned away  from  folly and  evil, and  have been of  service. But you  
line 30963=>choose to  stay  and gnaw the ends of your old plots. Stay then!  But I warn 
line 30964=>you. you will not easily come out again.  Not  unless the  dark hands of the 
line 30965=>East stretch out to  take you. Saruman!'  he  cried, and his voice  grew  in 
line 30966=>power and authority. 'Behold, I am not Gandalf the Grey,  whom you betrayed. 
line 30967=>I am Gandalf the White, who has returned from death. You have no colour 
line 30968=>now, 
line 30969=>and I cast you from the order and from the Council.' 
line 30970=>     He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in  a clear cold voice.  'Saruman, 
line 30971=>your  staff is broken.' There was  a  crack, and the staff  split asunder in 
line 30972=>Saruman's hand, and the head  of  it fell down at Gandalf's feet. 'Go!' said 
line 30973=>Gandalf. With a  cry Saruman fell back  and crawled away.  At that  moment a  
line 30974=>heavy shining thing  came hurtling down from  above. It glanced off the iron  
line 30975=>rail, even as Saruman left it, and passing close to Gandalf's head, it smote 
line 30976=>the stair on which  he  stood. The rail  rang and snapped . The stair cracked 
line 30977=>and splintered in glittering sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on  
line 30978=>down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark,  but glowing with a heart of fire. 
line 30979=>As it bounded away towards a pool Pippin ran after it and picked it up. 
line 30980=>
line 30981=>####-     'The murderous rogue!' cried Jomer.  But Gandalf was unmoved.  No, that 
line 30982=>was not thrown b Saruman, he said; nor even at his bidding, I think. It came  
line 30983=>from a window far above. A parting shot from Master Wormtongue, I fancy, 
line 30984=>but 
line 30985=>ill aimed.' 
line 30986=>     'The aim was poor, maybe, because he could  not make up  his mind which 
line 30987=>he hated more, you or Saruman,' said Aragorn. 
line 30988=>     'That may  be so,' said Gandalf.  'Small comfort will those two have in 
line 30989=>their  companionship:  they  will  gnaw  one  another  with  words.  But the 
line 30990=>punishment is just.  If Wormtongue ever comes out of Orthanc alive,  it will  
line 30991=>be more than he deserves.  
line 30992=>     'Here, my  lad, I'll take that!  I did not ask  you  to handle it,'  he 
line 30993=>cried,  turning sharply and seeing Pippin coming up the steps, slowly, as if 
line 30994=>he  were bearing a great  weight. He went  down to meet him and hastily took 
line 30995=>the dark  globe from the hobbit,  wrapping it in the folds of his cloak.  'I  
line 30996=>will take care of this,' he  said. 'It is not a thing, I guess, that Saruman 
line 30997=>would have chosen to cast away.' 
line 30998=>     'But he may have other things to cast,' said Gimli. 'If that is the end 
line 30999=>of the debate, let us go out of stone's throw, at least!' 
line 31000=>     'It is the end,' said Gandalf. 'Let us go.' 
line 31001=>     They turned  their  backs on  the doors of Orthanc, and  went down. The 
line 31002=>riders  hailed the king with joy, and saluted Gandalf. The  spell of Saruman 
line 31003=>was broken: they had seen him come at call, and crawl away, dismissed. 
line 31004=>     'Well, that is done,' said Gandalf. 'Now I must find Treebeard and tell 
line 31005=>him how things have gone.' 
line 31006=>     'He will have guessed,  surely?'  said  Merry. 'Were they likely to end 
line 31007=>any other way?' 
line 31008=>     'Not likely,' answered Gandalf, 'though  they came to  the balance of a  
line 31009=>hair. But I had reasons for  trying; some  merciful and some less so.  First  
line 31010=>Saruman was shown that the power  of his voice was waning. He cannot be 
line 31011=>both 
line 31012=>tyrant  and counsellor. When the plot  is ripe it remains  no longer secret. 
line 31013=>Yet he  fell into the trap, and tried to deal  with  his victims piece-meal, 
line 31014=>while  others listened. Then I  gave him a last choice and  a  fair  one: to 
line 31015=>renounce both Mordor and his private schemes, and  make amends by helping 
line 31016=>us 
line 31017=>in our need.  He knows our need,  none better.  Great service he could  have 
line 31018=>
line 31019=>####-rendered. But he  has chosen to withhold it, and  keep the power of Orthanc. 
line 31020=>He will not  serve, only command. He  lives now  in  terror of the shadow of 
line 31021=>Mordor, and yet he still dreams of riding  the storm. Unhappy fool!  He will  
line 31022=>be devoured, if the power of the East stretches out its arms to Isengard. We 
line 31023=>cannot  destroy  Orthanc from without, but  Sauron  -- who knows  what he can 
line 31024=>do?' 
line 31025=>     'And what  if Sauron does  not conquer? What will you do to him?' asked 
line 31026=>Pippin. 
line 31027=>     'I? Nothing!' said Gandalf. 'I will do nothing  to him. I  do  not wish 
line 31028=>for mastery. What w ill become of him? I  cannot say. I grieve that so  much 
line 31029=>that was good now festers in the  tower. Still  for us things have  not gone 
line 31030=>badly. Strange are the turns of fortune!  Often does  hatred hurt  itself! I 
line 31031=>guess that, even if we had entered in, we  could have found few treasures in 
line 31032=>Orthanc more precious than the thing which Wormtongue threw down at us.' 
line 31033=>     A shrill shriek; suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above. 
line 31034=>     'It seems  that  Saruman  thinks  so too,' said Gandalf.  'Let us leave 
line 31035=>them!' 
line 31036=>     They returned now to the ruins of the  gate. Hardly had they passed out 
line 31037=>under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where  they 
line 31038=>had stood, Treebeard and a dozen other Ents came striding up. Aragorn, Gimli 
line 31039=>and Legolas gazed at them in wonder. 
line 31040=>     'Here  are three of my  companions,  Treebeard,' said Gandalf. 'I  have 
line 31041=>spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.' He named them one by one. 
line 31042=>     The Old Ent looked at them  long and searchingly, and spoke to  them in 
line 31043=>turn.  Last  he  turned  to Legolas.  'So  you  have  come  all the way from 
line 31044=>Mirkwood, my good Elf? A very great forest it used to be!' 
line 31045=>     'And still is,' said Legolas. 'But not so great that we who dwell there 
line 31046=>ever tire of seeing new trees. I  should dearly love to journey in Fangorn's 
line 31047=>Wood. I  scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and  I did not wish to turn 
line 31048=>back.' 
line 31049=>     Treebeard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. 'I hope you may have your wish,  
line 31050=>ere the hills be much older,' he said. 
line 31051=>     'I will come,  if  I  have the fortune,' said  Legolas.  'I have made a  
line 31052=>bargain  with  my friend  that, if  all  goes well,  we  will  visit Fangorn 
line 31053=>together -- by your leave.' 
line 31054=>     'Any Elf that comes with you will be welcome,' said Treebeard. 
line 31055=>     'The  friend I speak of  is not an Elf,' said Legolas; 'I  mean  Gimli, 
line 31056=>
line 31057=>####-Gluin's son here.' Gimli bowed  low,  and the  axe slipped from his belt and 
line 31058=>clattered on the ground. 
line 31059=>     'Hoom, hm! Ah now,' said Treebeard, looking dark-eyed at him. 'A  dwarf 
line 31060=>and  an axe-bearer! Hoom! I have good  will to Elves; but you ask much. This 
line 31061=>is  a strange  friendship!' 'Strange it  may seem,' said Legolas; 'but while 
line 31062=>Gimli lives I shall not come to Fangorn alone. His axe is not for trees, but 
line 31063=>for  orc-necks, O Fangorn, Master of Fangorn's  Wood.  Forty-two he hewed in 
line 31064=>the battle.' 
line 31065=>     'Hoo! Come now!' said Treebeard.  'That is a better  story! Well, well, 
line 31066=>things will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them. But 
line 31067=>now we must part for a while. Day is drawing to an end, yet Gandalf says you 
line 31068=>must go ere nightfall, and the Lord of the Mark is eager for his own house.' 
line 31069=>     'Yes,  we must go, and go  now,' said Gandalf. 'I fear that I must take 
line 31070=>your gatekeepers from you. But you will manage well enough without them.' 
line 31071=>     'Maybe I shall,' said Treebeard. 'But I shall miss them. We have become 
line 31072=>friends in so short a while that I think I must be getting  hasty  -- growing 
line 31073=>backwards towards youth, perhaps. But there,  they  are the first  new thing 
line 31074=>under  Sun or Moon that I  have seen  for many a long,  long day. I shall not 
line 31075=>forget them. I have put their names into the Long List.  Ents will  remember  
line 31076=>it. 
line 31077=>     Ents the earthborn, old as mountains, 
line 31078=>     the wide-walkers, water drinking; 
line 31079=>     and hungry as hunters, the Hobbit children, 
line 31080=>     the laughing-folk, the little people, 
line 31081=>     they shall remain friends as long as leaves are renewed. Fare you well! 
line 31082=>But if you hear news up in your pleasant land,  in the Shire,  send me word!  
line 31083=>You  know what I mean: word or sight of the Entwives. Come yourselves if 
line 31084=>you 
line 31085=>can!' 
line 31086=>     'We  will!'  said Merry  and  Pippin together,  and  they  turned  away 
line 31087=>hastily.  Treebeard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking  his 
line 31088=>head thoughtfully. Then he turned to Gandalf.  
line 31089=>     'So Saruman would not leave?' he said. 'I did  not think  he would. His 
line 31090=>heart is as rotten as a black Huorn's. Still, if  I were overcome and all my 
line 31091=>trees destroyed, I would not come  while I had one dark  hole  left to  hide 
line 31092=>in.' 
line 31093=>     'No,'  said Gandalf.  'But  you have not plotted to  cover all the world 
line 31094=>
line 31095=>####-with your trees and choke all other living things. But there  it is, Saruman 
line 31096=>remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can.  He has the 
line 31097=>Key of Orthanc. But he must not be allowed to escape.' 
line 31098=>     'Indeed no!  Ents will see to that,' said Treebeard. 'Saruman shall not 
line 31099=>set foot beyond the rock, without my leave. Ents will watch over him.' 
line 31100=>     'Good!' said  Gandalf. 'That is what I  hoped. Now I can go and turn to 
line 31101=>other matters with one care the less.  But you must be wary. The waters have 
line 31102=>gone down. It will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower, I fear. I 
line 31103=>do  not  doubt  that  there were  deep ways  delved under Orthanc,  and that 
line 31104=>Saruman hopes to go and come  unmarked, before long.  If you  will undertake 
line 31105=>the labour, I beg you to pour in the waters again; and do so, until Isengard 
line 31106=>remains  a  standing  pool,  or  you  discover  the outlets.  When  all  the 
line 31107=>underground places are drowned, and  the outlets blocked, then  Saruman must  
line 31108=>stay upstairs and look out of  the windows.' 
line 31109=>     'Leave it to  the Ents!' said Treebeard.  'We shall  search the  valley 
line 31110=>from head to foot and peer under every pebble. Trees are coming back to live 
line 31111=>here, old  trees,  wild trees. The Watchwood we will call it. Not a squirrel 
line 31112=>will go her e, but  I shall  know of it. Leave  it to Ents! Until seven times 
line 31113=>the years  in  which  he tormented  us  have passed,  we shall  not  tire of 
line 31114=>watching him.'

line 31119=>Chapter 11. The Palantnr 
line 31120=>
line 31121=> 
line 31122=> 
line 31123=>     The sun was sinking  behind the long  western arm of the mounta ins when 
line 31124=>Gandalf and his companions, and the king with his Riders, set out again from 
line 31125=>Isengard. Gandalf took Merry behind him, and Aragorn took Pippin. Two of 
line 31126=>the 
line 31127=>king's men  went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down 
line 31128=>into the valley. The others followed at an easy pace. 
line 31129=>     Ents in a  solemn  row stood like  statues at the gate, with their long 
line 31130=>arms  uplifted, but they made  no sound. Merry and  Pippin looked back, when 
line 31131=>they had passed some way down the winding road.  Sunlight was  still shining 
line 31132=>in the sky, but long shadows reached over Isengard: grey  ruins falling into 
line 31133=>darkness. Treebeard stood alone  there now, like the distant stump of an old 
line 31134=>tree: the hobbits thought of their first meeting, upon  the  sunny ledge far  
line 31135=>away on the borders of Fangorn. 
line 31136=>     They  came  to the pillar  of  the  White  Hand.  The  pillar was still 
line 31137=>standing,  but the graven hand had  been thrown  down  and broken into small 
line 31138=>pieces. Right in the middle  of the road  the long forefinger lay,  white in 
line 31139=>the dusk, its red nail darkening to black. 
line 31140=>     'The Ents pay attention to every detail!' said Gandalf.  
line 31141=>     They rode on, and evening deepened in the valley. 
line 31142=>     'Are we riding far tonight,  Gandalf?'  asked  Merry after  a while. 'I  
line 31143=>don't  know  how you feel with small rag-tag  dangling  behind you; but  the 
line 31144=>rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.' 
line 31145=>     'So you heard that?' said Gandalf. 'Don't let it rankle! Be thankful no 
line 31146=>longer words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it  is any comfort  
line 31147=>to your pride,  I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in 
line 31148=>his thoughts than all the rest of us.  Who you are; how  you came there, and 
line 31149=>why; what  you know;  whether you were captured,  and if so, how you escaped 
line 31150=>when all the Orcs perished -- it is with those little riddles that the great 
line 31151=>mind ¢f Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Meriadoc, is a compliment, if 
line 31152=>you feel honoured by his concern.' 
line 31153=>     'Thank  you!' said Merry. 'But it is a greater honour to dangle at your 
line 31154=>tail, Gandalf. For one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a  
line 31155=>
line 31156=>####-question a second time. Are we riding far tonight?' 
line 31157=>     Gandalf laughed. 'A most unquenchable hobbit! All Wizards should have a  
line 31158=>hobbit or two in their care -- to teach them the meaning of the word, and to 
line 31159=>correct them. I  beg your pardon.  But  I have given  thought even to  these 
line 31160=>simple matters.  We will ride for a few  hours, gently, until we come to the 
line 31161=>end of the valley. Tomorrow we must ride faster. 
line 31162=>     'When we came, we meant to go straight from Isengard back to the king's 
line 31163=>house  at Edoras over the  plains, a ride  of  some days. But we have  taken 
line 31164=>thought and changed the plan. Messengers have gone ahead to Helm's  Deep, to 
line 31165=>warn them that  the king is returning tomorrow. He will ride from there with 
line 31166=>many men to Dunharrow by paths among the hills. From now on no more than 
line 31167=>two 
line 31168=>or  three together are to go openly over the land,  by day or night, when it 
line 31169=>can be avoided.' 
line 31170=>     'Nothing or a double helping is  your way!'  said Merry. 'I am afraid I 
line 31171=>was not looking beyond tonight's bed. Where and what are Helm's Deep and all 
line 31172=>the rest of it? I don't know anything about this country.' 
line 31173=>     'Then you'd best learn  something, if you  wish to  understand  what is 
line 31174=>happening.  But  not just  now, and not from  me: I have too  many  pressing 
line 31175=>things to think about.' 
line 31176=>     'All right, I'll tackle Strider by the camp-fire: he's less  testy. But 
line 31177=>why all this secrecy? I thought we'd won the battle!' 
line 31178=>     Yes,  we  have  won,  but  only  the first victor  and  that  in itself 
line 31179=>increases our danger. There was some link between Isengard and Mordor, 
line 31180=>which 
line 31181=>I have not yet fathomed. How they exchanged news I am not sure; but they did 
line 31182=>so.  The Eye  of Barad-dyr will be looking impatiently towards  the Wizard's 
line 31183=>Vale, I think; and towards Rohan. The less it sees the better.' 
line 31184=>     The road passed  slowly, winding down the valley. Now  further, and now 
line 31185=>nearer Isen flowed in its stony bed. Night came down from the mountains. All 
line 31186=>the mists were gone. A  chill wind blew. The moon, now  waxing round, filled 
line 31187=>the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen.  The  shoulders of  the mountain  to 
line 31188=>their  right  sloped down to bare hills.  The wide plains opened grey before 
line 31189=>them. 
line 31190=>     At  last they halted. Then they turned aside,  leaving the highway  and 
line 31191=>taking to the sweet upland turf again. Going westward a mile or so they came 
line 31192=>to a dale. It  opened southward,  leaning back into the slope  of  round Dol 
line 31193=>
line 31194=>####-Baran,  the last  hill of  the northern ranges,  greenfooted,  crowned  with 
line 31195=>heather. The sides of the glen were shaggy with last  year's bracken,  among  
line 31196=>which the tight -curled  fronds of  spring  were just  thrusting through  the 
line 31197=>sweet-scented earth. Thornbushes grew thick  upon the low banks,  and  under  
line 31198=>them they made their camp,  two hours  or so before  the middle of the night.  
line 31199=>They lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of  a spreading  hawthorn,  
line 31200=>tall as a tree, writhen with age; but hale in every limb. Buds were swelling 
line 31201=>at each twig's tip. 
line 31202=>     Guards were  set,  two at a watch.  The  rest, after  they had  supped, 
line 31203=>wrapped  themselves in a cloak and blanket and  slept. The  hobbits lay in a  
line 31204=>corner by themselves  upon a pile  of old  bracken.  Merry was  sleepy,  but 
line 31205=>Pippin now seemed curiously restless. The bracken cracked and rustled, as he 
line 31206=>twisted and turned. 
line 31207=>     'What's the matter?' asked Merry. 'Are you lying on an ant-hill?' 
line 31208=>     'No,'  said Pippin, 'but  I'm not  comfortable. I wonder how long it is 
line 31209=>since I slept in a bed?' 
line 31210=>     Merry  yawned. 'Work  it out on your fingers!' he said.  'But you  must  
line 31211=>know how long it is since we left Lurien.' 
line 31212=>     'Oh, that!' said Pippin. 'I mean a real bed in a bedroom.' 
line 31213=>     'Well,  Rivendell  then,'  said  Merry.  'But  I could  sleep  anywhere 
line 31214=>tonight.' 
line 31215=>     'You had the luck, Merry,' said Pippin softly, after a long pause. 'You  
line 31216=>were riding with Gandalf.' 
line 31217=>     'Well, what of it?' 
line 31218=>     'Did you get any news, any information out of him?' 
line 31219=>     'Yes, a good deal. More than usual. But you heard it all or most of it: 
line 31220=>you were close by,  and we were talking no secrets. But you  can go with him 
line 31221=>tomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him-and if he'll have you.' 
line 31222=>     'Can I? Good! But he's close, isn't he? Not changed at all.' 
line 31223=>     'Oh  yes, he is!'  said Merry,  waking  up  a little, and  beginning to 
line 31224=>wonder what was bothering his companion. 'He has grown, or something. He 
line 31225=>can 
line 31226=>be  both  kinder  and  more alarming, merrier and more solemn than before, I 
line 31227=>think. He has changed; but  we have not had a chance to see  how  much, yet. 
line 31228=>But th ink of the last part of that  business  with Saruman! Remember Saruman 
line 31229=>was  once Gandalf's superior: head  of  the  Council, whatever  that  may be 
line 31230=>
line 31231=>####-exactly. He was Saruman the White. Gandalf is the  White  now.  Saruman 
line 31232=>came 
line 31233=>when he was told, and  his rod was taken;  and then he was just told  to go, 
line 31234=>and he went!' 
line 31235=>     'Well, if Gandalf has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's 
line 31236=>all,' Pippin argued. 'That-glass  ball, now. He seemed mighty  pleased  with 
line 31237=>it. He knows or  guesses something about i t. But does he tell  us  what? No, 
line 31238=>not  a word. Yet I picked it up, and I saved  it  from rolling into  a pool. 
line 31239=>Here, I'll take that, my lad -- that's all. I wonder what it  is? It felt so 
line 31240=>very heavy.' Pippin's voice fell very low as if he was talking to h imself.  
line 31241=>     'Hullo!' said  Merry. 'So that's what is bothering you? Now, Pippin  my 
line 31242=>lad, don't  forget Gildor's  saying  --  the one Sam  used to quote:  Do  not 
line 31243=>meddle in the at Fairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.' 
line 31244=>     'But  our  whole  life for  months  has been  one long meddling  in the 
line 31245=>affairs  of Wizards,' said Pippin.  'I  should like a bit  of information as 
line 31246=>well as danger. I should like a look at that ball.' 
line 31247=>     'Go to  sleep!'  said Merry. 'You'll  get information enough, sooner or 
line 31248=>later. My  dear Pippin, no Took ever beat a  Brandybuck for inquisitiveness;  
line 31249=>but is this the time, I ask you?' 
line 31250=>     'All right! What's the harm in my  telling you  what  I should like:  a  
line 31251=>look  at that stone? I know I can't have it, with old Ganda lf sitting on it, 
line 31252=>like a hen on an egg. But it doesn't help much to get no more from you  than 
line 31253=>a you-can't-have-it so-go-to-sleep!' 
line 31254=>     'Well, what else could  I say?' said Merry. 'I'm sorry, Pippin, but you  
line 31255=>really must wait  till the  morning.  I'll  be as curious as you  like after  
line 31256=>breakfast, and I'll  help in any  way I can at wizard-wheedling. But I can't  
line 31257=>keep awake  any  longer. If I yawn any more, I shall split at the ears. Good  
line 31258=>night!' 
line 31259=>     Pippin said no more. He lay still now, but sleep remained far away; and 
line 31260=>it was not  encouraged by  the  sound of Merry breathing softly, asleep in a  
line 31261=>few minutes  after saying good night. 'The thought of  the dark globe seemed 
line 31262=>to grow stronger as all grew quiet.  Pippin felt  again its  weight  in  his 
line 31263=>hands, and saw again the mysterious red depths into which he had  looked for 
line 31264=>a moment. He tossed and turned and tried to think of something else. 
line 31265=>     At last he could stand it no longer. He got up and looked round. It was 
line 31266=>chilly, and he wrapped  his cloak about him.   The  moon was shining cold and 
line 31267=>white, down into  the  dell, and  the shadows of the bushes were black.  All 
line 31268=>
line 31269=>####-about lay sleeping shapes. The  two guards were not in view: they were up on 
line 31270=>the hill, perhaps, or hidden in the bracken. Driven by some  impulse that he 
line 31271=>did not understand,  Pippin  walked  softly to  where Gandalf lay. He looked 
line 31272=>down at him. The wizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there 
line 31273=>was a  glitter  of eyes under his long  lashes. Pippin stepped back hastily. 
line 31274=>But  Gandalf  made no sign;  and drawn forward once more, half  against  his 
line 31275=>will, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard's head. He was rolled 
line 31276=>in  a blanket, with  his cloak  spread over  the  top; and close beside him, 
line 31277=>between his right  side and  his  bent arm,  there was a hummock,  something 
line 31278=>round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off  
line 31279=>it to the ground. 
line 31280=>     Hardly breathing, Pippin  crept nearer, foot by  foot. At last he knelt 
line 31281=>down. Then he put his hands out  stealthily, and slowly  lifted the lump up: 
line 31282=>it did not  seem quite  so heavy as he  had  expected. 'Only some  bundle of 
line 31283=>oddments, perhaps, after all,'  he thought  with  a strange sense of relief;  
line 31284=>but he did not put the bundle down again. He stood for a moment clasping it . 
line 31285=>Then an idea came into his mind.  He  tiptoed away, found a large stone, and  
line 31286=>came back. 
line 31287=>     Quickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and kneeling 
line 31288=>down, laid it back by the wizard's hand. Then at last he looked at the thing 
line 31289=>that he had uncovered. There it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and 
line 31290=>dead, lying bare before his knees. Pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in 
line 31291=>his own cloak, and half turned to go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf 
line 31292=>moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed  to be in a strange 
line 31293=>tongue; his hand groped  out  and clasped the  wrapped stone, then he sighed  
line 31294=>and did not move again. 
line 31295=>     'You  idiotic fool!' Pippin muttered  to himself. 'You're going  to get 
line 31296=>yourself into frightful  trouble. Put it back quick!'  But he found now that 
line 31297=>his knees  quaked, and he did not  dare to  go  near enough to the wizard to 
line 31298=>reach  the  bundle.  'I'll never get  it back  now without  waking  him,' he 
line 31299=>thought, 'not till I'm a bit calmer. S¢ I may as well have a look first. Not 
line 31300=>just  here though!'  He stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not  far 
line 31301=>from his bed. The moon looked in over the edge of the dell. 
line 31302=>     Pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball  between  them. He bent 
line 31303=>low over it, looking like a greedy  child stooping over a bowl of food, in a  
line 31304=>corner away from  others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at  it. The  air 
line 31305=>seemed still and tense about him. At first the globe was dark, black as jet, 
line 31306=>
line 31307=>####-with the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then ther e came a faint glow and 
line 31308=>stir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look  
line 31309=>away. Soon all  the inside  seemed on fire;  the ball  was spinning,  or the 
line 31310=>lights within were  revolving. Suddenly the lights went out.  He gave a gasp  
line 31311=>and struggled; but  he  remained bent,  clasping the ball  with  both hands.  
line 31312=>Closer and closer he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly 
line 31313=>for a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still. 
line 31314=>     The cry was  piercing. The guards  leapt down from  the banks.  All the 
line 31315=>camp was soon astir. 
line 31316=>     'So this is the thief!' said Gandalf.  Hastily  he cast his  cloak over  
line 31317=>the  globe where  it lay.  'But  you, Pippin!  This is a  grievous  turn  to 
line 31318=>things!' He knelt by  Pippin's body: the hobbit was lying on his back rigid, 
line 31319=>with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky. 'The devilry! What mischief has he  
line 31320=>done-to himself, and to all of us?' The wizard's face was drawn and haggard.  
line 31321=>     He took Pippin's hand and bent over his face, listening for his breath; 
line 31322=>then he laid  his hands on his brow.  The hobbit shuddered. His eyes closed.  
line 31323=>He cried  out;  and sat  up. staring in bewilderment at all the  faces round 
line 31324=>him, pale in the moonlight. 
line 31325=>     'It is not for you, Saruman!' he  cried in a shrill and toneless  voice 
line 31326=>shrinking away from Gandalf. 'I will send for it at once. Do you understand?  
line 31327=>Say just that!' Then he struggled to get up and escape but Gandalf held  him 
line 31328=>gently and firmly. 
line 31329=>     'Peregrin Took!' he said. 'Come back!' 
line 31330=>     The  hobbit relaxed  and  fell  back,  clinging  to  the wizard's hand. 
line 31331=>'Gandalf!' he cried. 'Gandalf! Forgive me!' 
line 31332=>     'Forgive you?' said the wizard. 'Tell me first what you have done!' 
line 31333=>     'I, I  took  the  ball  and looked at it,' stammered Pippin; 'and I saw 
line 31334=>things that frightened me. And I wanted to go away, but I couldn't. And then 
line 31335=>he came  and questioned  me; and  he looked  at me, and,  and  that is all I 
line 31336=>remember.' 
line 31337=>     'That won't  do,' said Gandalf sternly. 'What did you see, and what did 
line 31338=>you say?' 
line 31339=>     Pippin shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. They all stared at 
line 31340=>him in  silence, except Merry who turned away. But  Gandalf's face was still  
line 31341=>hard.  'Speak!' he said. 
line 31342=>     In a low hesitating voice Pippin began again, and slowly his words grew 
line 31343=>clearer  and  stronger. 'I saw a  dark sky, and tall battlements,' he  said. 
line 31344=>
line 31345=>####-'And tiny  stars. It seemed very far away and long ago, yet hard and  clear. 
line 31346=>Then the stars went in and out-they were  cut off by things with wings. Very 
line 31347=>big, I think, really; but  in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round 
line 31348=>the tower. I  thought  there  were nine of them.  One  began to fly straight 
line 31349=>towards  me, getting bigger and bigger. It had a horrible -- no, no! I can't  
line 31350=>say. 
line 31351=>     'I tried to get  away, because I thought  it would fly out; but when it 
line 31352=>had covered all the globe, it disappeared. Then he came. He did not speak so  
line 31353=>that I could hear words. He just looked, and I understood. 
line 31354=>     '"So you have come back? Why have you neglected to report for so long?" 
line 31355=>     'I did not answer. He said: "Who are you?" I still did not answer,  but 
line 31356=>it hurt me horribly; and he pressed me, so I said: "A hobbit." 
line 31357=>     'Then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. It was cruel. 
line 31358=>It was like being  stabbed with knives. I struggled.  But  he sa id: "Wait  a  
line 31359=>moment!  We shall meet again soon. Tell Saruman  that this dainty is not for  
line 31360=>him. I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!" 
line 31361=>     'Then  he gloated over me. I felt  I was  falling  to pieces. No, no! I 
line 31362=>can't say any more. I  don't remember anything else.' 
line 31363=>     'Look at me!' said Gandalf. 
line 31364=>     Pippin looked up straight into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze for a  
line 31365=>moment  in silence. Then  his face grew  gentler, and the shadow  of a smile 
line 31366=>appeared. He laid his hand softly on Pippin's head. 
line 31367=>     'All right!' he said. 'Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no 
line 31368=>lie in your eyes, as I feared. But  he did not speak long with you.  A fool, 
line 31369=>but an honest  fool,  you remain, Peregrin Took. Wiser ones might  have done 
line 31370=>worse  in such  a  pass. But mark this!  You  have  been saved, and all your 
line 31371=>friends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is called. You cannot count on it 
line 31372=>a second  time. If he had  questioned  you, then and there, almost certainly 
line 31373=>you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too 
line 31374=>eager. He did not want information only: he wanted you,  quickly, so that he 
line 31375=>could deal with you in the  Dark Tower, slowly.  Don't shudder! If  you will 
line 31376=>meddle  in  the affairs  of Wizards, you  must  be prepared  to think of such 
line 31377=>things. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not turned out as 
line 31378=>evilly as they might.' 
line 31379=>     He  lifted  Pippin  gently  and  carried  him  back to  his bed.  Merry 
line 31380=>followed, and sat down beside him. Lie there and rest, if you can,  Pippin!' 
line 31381=>said Gandalf. 'Trust me. If you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of 
line 31382=>
line 31383=>####-it!  Such things can be cured. But anyway, my dear hobbit, don't put  a lump  
line 31384=>of  rock  under  my  elbow  again! Now, I will leave you  two together for a  
line 31385=>while.' 
line 31386=>     With  that Gandalf  returned to the others, who  were still standing by 
line 31387=>the  Orthanc-stone in troubled thought. 'Peril comes in the night when least 
line 31388=>expected,' he said. 'We have had a narrow escape!' 
line 31389=>     'How is the hobbit, Pippin?' asked Aragorn. 
line 31390=>     'I think all  will  be well  now,' answered  Gandalf. 'He was  not held 
line 31391=>long, and  hobbits have  an  amazing power of  recovery. The memory, or  the 
line 31392=>horror of it, will probably fade  quickly. Too  quickly, perhaps. Will  you, 
line 31393=>Aragorn, take the Orthanc-stone and guard it? It is a dangerous charge.' 
line 31394=>     'Dangerous indeed, but not to all,' said Aragorn. 'There is one who may 
line 31395=>claim it by right.  For this assuredly  is the palantnr of Orthanc  from the 
line 31396=>treasury  of  Elendil, set here by  the Kings  of Gondor. Now my hour  draws 
line 31397=>near. I will take it.' 
line 31398=>     Gandalf looked  at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he 
line 31399=>lifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it. 
line 31400=>     'Receive it,  lord!' he said: 'in earnest of other things that shall be 
line 31401=>given back. But if I may counsel you in the use  of your own, do not use  it 
line 31402=>-- yet! Be wary!' 
line 31403=>     'When have I been hasty or unwary, who have  waited and prepared for so 
line 31404=>many long years?' said Aragorn. 
line 31405=>     'Never  yet.  Do not then  stumble at the end  of the  road,'  answered 
line 31406=>Gandalf. 'But  at the least keep this thing secret. You, and all others that 
line 31407=>stand  here! The hobbit, Peregrin,  above  all should not know  where it  is 
line 31408=>bestowed.  The evil fit may come on him again. For alas! he  has  handled it  
line 31409=>and  looked in it, as should never have  happened. He ought  never  to  have  
line 31410=>touched it in Isengard,  and  there I should have been quicker. But my  mind 
line 31411=>was bent  on Saruman, and I did not at once  guess the  nature of the Stone. 
line 31412=>Then I was weary, and as I lay pondering it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!' 
line 31413=>     'Yes, there can  be no doubt,' said Aragorn. 'At last we know the link' 
line 31414=>between Isengard and Mordor, and how it worked. Much is explained.' 'Strange 
line 31415=>powers have our enemies, and strange  weaknesses!' said Thjoden. 'But it has 
line 31416=>long been said: oft evil will shall evil mar. ' 
line 31417=>     'That many times is seen,' said Gandalf. 'But at this time we have been 
line 31418=>strangely fortunate. Maybe, I  have been  saved by this  hobbit from a grave 
line 31419=>blunder. I  had considered whether or not to probe this Stone myself to find 
line 31420=>
line 31421=>####-its uses. Had I done so, I should have been revealed to him myself. I am not  
line 31422=>ready for such a  trial, if indeed I  shall ever be so:  But even if I found 
line 31423=>the power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for  him to see me, yet  
line 31424=>-- until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer.' 
line 31425=>     'That hour is now come, I think,' said Aragorn. 
line 31426=>     'Not yet,' said Gandalf. 'There remains a short while of doubt which we 
line 31427=>must use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that  the Stone was in  Orthanc  -- 
line 31428=>why should he not? And that therefore the hobbit  was captive there,  driven 
line 31429=>to look in the  glass for his  torment by  Saruman.  That dark mind will  be 
line 31430=>filled  now with  the voice  and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it 
line 31431=>may take some time before he  learns his error. We must snatch that time. We 
line 31432=>have been too leisurely. We must  move. The neighbourhood of  Isengard is no 
line 31433=>place now  to  linger in. I will  ride ahead at once with Peregrin  Took. It 
line 31434=>will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep.' 
line 31435=>     'I will keep  Jomer and ten Riders,'  said the  king. 'They shall  ride 
line 31436=>with me at early day.  The rest may go with Aragorn and ride as soon as they 
line 31437=>have a mind.' 
line 31438=>     'As you  will,'  said Gandalf. 'But  make all  the speed you may to the 
line 31439=>cover of the hills, to Helm's Deep!' 
line 31440=>     At that moment  a shadow fell over them. The bright moonlight seemed to 
line 31441=>be suddenly cut  off. Several of the Riders cried out, and crouched, holding 
line 31442=>their  arms above  their hea ds, as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind 
line 31443=>fear and a deadly  cold fell on them. Cowering they looked up. A vast winged 
line 31444=>shape  passed over the moon like a  black cloud. It wheeled and went  north, 
line 31445=>flying at a speed greater than any wind of Middle-earth. The  stars  fainted 
line 31446=>before it. It was gone. 
line 31447=>     They stood up, rigid as stones. Gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and 
line 31448=>downwards, stiff, his hands clenched. 
line 31449=>     'Nazgyl!' he cried.  'The messenger of Mordor. The storm is coming. The  
line 31450=>Nazgyl have crossed the River!  Ride, ride! Wait  not for the  dawn! Let not  
line 31451=>the swift wait for the slow! Ride!' 
line 31452=>     He  sprang  away, calling Shadowfax  as  he ran.  Aragorn followed him.  
line 31453=>Going  to Pippin, Gandalf picked him up in his arms. 'You shall come with me 
line 31454=>this  time,' he said.  'Shadowfax shall show you his  paces.' Then he ran to 
line 31455=>the place  where he had slept. Shadowfax  stood there  already. Slinging the  
line 31456=>small bag which was all his luggage  across his  shoulders, the wizard leapt 
line 31457=>upon the  horse's back. Aragor n lifted Pippin and set him in Gandalf's arms,  
line 31458=>
line 31459=>####-,wrapped in cloak and blanket. 
line 31460=>     'Farewell! Follow fast!' cried Gandalf. 'Away, Shadowfax!' 
line 31461=>     The  great  horse  tossed his  head. His  flowing tail  flicked in  the 
line 31462=>moonlight. Then he leapt forward, spurning the  earth, and was gone like the 
line 31463=>north wind from the mountains.  
line 31464=>     'A beautiful, restful  night!' said  Merry to Aragorn. 'Some folk  have 
line 31465=>wonderful luck. He did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with Gandalf 
line 31466=>-- and there he goes! Instead of being turned into  a stone himself to stand 
line 31467=>here for ever as a warning.' 
line 31468=>     'If  you had been the first to lift the Orthanc-stone, and not  he, how 
line 31469=>would it be now?' said Aragorn. 'You might have done worse. Who can say? 
line 31470=>But 
line 31471=>now it is your luck to come with me, I fear. At  once. Go and get ready, and  
line 31472=>bring anything that Pippin left behind. Make haste!' 
line 31473=>     Over the  plains  Shadowfax  was  flying,  needing  no  urging  and  no 
line 31474=>guidance. Less than  an hour  had  passed, and they had reached the Fords of 
line 31475=>Isen and crossed  them. The Mound of the Riders and its cold spears lay grey 
line 31476=>behind them. 
line 31477=>     Pippin was recovering. He  was warm, but the wind in his  face was keen 
line 31478=>and refreshing. He was  with  Gandalf. The horror of  the stone  and  of the 
line 31479=>hideous shadow over the  moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of 
line 31480=>the mountains or in a passing dream. He drew a deep breath. 
line 31481=>     'I did not know  you rode bare-back, Gandalf,' he said. 'You  haven't a  
line 31482=>saddle or a bridle!' 
line 31483=>     'I  do not ride elf-fashion,  except on Shadowfax,' said Gandalf.  'But 
line 31484=>Shadowfax will have no harness. You do not ride Shadowfax:  he is willing to 
line 31485=>carry you -or not. If he is willing, that is enough. It  is then his business 
line 31486=>to see that you remain on his back, unless you jump off into the air.' 
line 31487=>     'How  fast is  he going?'  asked Pippin. 'Fast  by  the  wind, but very 
line 31488=>smooth. And how light his footfalls are!' 
line 31489=>     'He  is  running  now  as  fast  as  the swiftest horse could  gallop,' 
line 31490=>answered Gandalf; 'but that is not fast for him. The land is rising a little 
line 31491=>here, and is more broken than it was beyond the river. But see how the White 
line 31492=>Mountains are  drawing near under the stars! Yonder are the  Thrihyrne peaks 
line 31493=>like black spears. It will not  be long before we reach the  branching roads 
line 31494=>and come to the Deeping-coomb, where the battle was fought two nights ago.' 
line 31495=>     Pippin was silent again for a while. He heard Gandalf singing softly to 
line 31496=>
line 31497=>####-himself, murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran 
line 31498=>under them. At last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught  
line 31499=>the  words: a few lines came clear  to his  ears  through the rushing of the 
line 31500=>wind: 
line 31501=>     Tall ships and tall kings 
line 31502=>     Three times three, 
line 31503=>     What brought they from the foundered land  
line 31504=>     Over the flowing sea? 
line 31505=>     Seven stars and seven stones 
line 31506=>     And one white tree. 
line 31507=>     'What are you saying, Gandalf?' asked Pippin. 
line 31508=>     'I was  just  running over  some of the  Rhymes  of  Lore in  my mind ' 
line 31509=>answered  the wizard. 'Hobbits,  I suppose, have forgotten  them, even those  
line 31510=>that they ever knew.' 
line 31511=>     'No, not  all,'  said  Pippin.  'And  we have many  of our  own,  which 
line 31512=>wouldn't interest you, perhaps. But I have never heard  this one. What is it 
line 31513=>about -- the seven stars and seven stones?' 
line 31514=>     'About the palantnri of the Kings of Old,' said Gandalf. 
line 31515=>     'And what are they?' 
line 31516=>     'The name meant  that which looks far away. The Orthanc-stone was one.' 
line 31517=>     'Then it was not made, not made'  -- Pippin hesitated -- 'by the Enemy?' 
line 31518=>     'No,' said Gandalf. 'Nor by  Saruman. It is  beyond his art, and beyond  
line 31519=>Sauron's too. The palantnri came from beyond Westernesse  from Eldamar.  
line 31520=>The 
line 31521=>Noldor made  them. Flanor himself,  maybe, wrought them, in days so long ago 
line 31522=>that the time cannot be measured in years. But there is  nothing that Sauron 
line 31523=>cannot turn to evil uses. Alas for  Saruman! It was his downfall,  as  I now 
line 31524=>perceive.  Perilous to us all  are the devices  of an  art  deeper  than  we 
line 31525=>possess ourselves. Yet he must bear the blame. Fool!  to keep it secret, for  
line 31526=>his own  profit. No word did he ever  speak of it to any of the  Council. We 
line 31527=>had not yet given  thought  to the fate of  the palantnri of Gondor  in  its 
line 31528=>ruinous wars. By Men they were almost forgotten. Even  in Gondor they were a  
line 31529=>secret known only to a few; in Arnor they were remembered only in a rhyme of 
line 31530=>lore among the D®nedain.' 
line 31531=>     'What  did  the Men of old use  them for?' asked Pippin, delighted  and 
line 31532=>astonished at getting answers to  so  many questions, and wondering how long 
line 31533=>it would last. 
line 31534=>
line 31535=>####-     'To  see far  off, and to converse in thought with  one  another,' said 
line 31536=>Gandalf. 'In that way they long guarded and united the realm of Gondor. They 
line 31537=>set up Stones at Minas Anor, and at  Minas Ithil, and at Orthanc in the ring 
line 31538=>of Isengard. The  chief  and master of these was under  the Dome of Stars at 
line 31539=>Osgiliath before  its ruin. The three others were far  away in the North. In 
line 31540=>the house  of Elrond  it is told that they were at Ann®minas, and  Amon Syl, 
line 31541=>and Elendil's Stone was on the Tower Hills that look towards M ithlond in the 
line 31542=>Gulf of Lune where the grey ships lie. 
line 31543=>     'Each palantnr replied to each, but all those in Gondor were  ever open 
line 31544=>to the view of Osgiliath.  Now  it appears that,  as the rock of Orthanc has 
line 31545=>withstood  the  storms of time, so  there  the palantnr  of  that tower  has 
line 31546=>remained.  But alone  it could do nothing but see small images of things far 
line 31547=>off  and days remote. Very  useful, no doubt, that  was  to Saruman;  yet it 
line 31548=>seems that he was not content. Further and further abroad he gazed, until  he 
line 31549=>cast his gaze upon Barad-dyr. Then he was caught! 
line 31550=>     'Who knows where the lost Stones of Arnor and Gondor now lie buried, or  
line 31551=>drowned deep? But  one. at least Sauron  must have obtained and  mastered to 
line 31552=>his purposes. I guess that  it was the Ithil-stone,  for he took Minas Ithil 
line 31553=>long ago and turned it into an evil place: Minas Morgul, it has become. 
line 31554=>     'Easy  it  is  now to guess how quickly the roving  eye of Saruman  was 
line 31555=>trapped and held; and how  ever  since he has been persuaded  from afar, and 
line 31556=>daunted when persuasion  would not serve. The biter bit, the  hawk under the 
line 31557=>eagle's foot, the spider  in a  steel web!  How long, I  wonder, has he been 
line 31558=>constrained to  come often to his glass for inspection and instruction,  and 
line 31559=>the Orthanc-stone so bent towards Barad-dyr  that, if  any  save  a will  of 
line 31560=>adamant now looks into it,  it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither? 
line 31561=>And  how it draws  one to itself! Have I  not  felt it?  Even now  my  heart 
line 31562=>desires to test my will  upon it,  to see if I could not wrench it from  him 
line 31563=>and turn it where I  would-to look across the wide seas of water and of time 
line 31564=>to Tirion the Fair, and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Flanor at 
line 31565=>their work, while both  the  White Tree and the  Golden were  in flower!' He 
line 31566=>sighed and fell silent. 
line 31567=>     'I wish I had known all this before,' said Pippin. 'I had  no notion of 
line 31568=>what I was doing.' 
line 31569=>     'Oh yes,  you had,' said  Gandalf. 'You  knew you were behaving wrongly 
line 31570=>and  foolishly;  and you told yourself so,  though you did not listen. I did 
line 31571=>not tell you all this before, because  it is only by  musing on all that has 
line 31572=>
line 31573=>####-happened that I have at last  understood, even as we ride together. But if I  
line 31574=>had spoken sooner, it would not have lessened your desire, or made it easier  
line 31575=>to  resist.  On the  contrary! No, the burned hand teaches best. After  that 
line 31576=>advice about fire goes to the heart.' 
line 31577=>     'It does,' said  Pippin. 'If all the seven  stones were laid out before 
line 31578=>me now, I should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets.' 
line 31579=>     'Good!' said Gandalf. 'That is what I hoped.' 
line 31580=>     'But I should like to know--' Pippin began. 
line 31581=>     'Mercy!' cried Gandalf. 'If the giving of information is to be the cure 
line 31582=>of your inquisitiveness, I shall spend all the rest of my  days in answering 
line 31583=>you. What more do you want to know?' 
line 31584=>     'The  names  of all the stars, and of all living  things, and the whole 
line 31585=>history of Middle-earth and Over -heaven and of  the Sundering Seas ' laughed 
line 31586=>Pippin. 'Of  course!  What less? But I  am  not in  a hurry tonight.  At the 
line 31587=>moment  I was  just wondering about the  black  shadow. I  heard  you  shout 
line 31588=>"messenger of Mordor". What was it? What could it do at Isengard?' 
line 31589=>     'It was a Black Rider on wings, a Nazgyl,' said Gandalf. 'It could have 
line 31590=>taken you away to the Dark Tower . ' 
line 31591=>     'But it was not  coming  for me, was  it?' faltered Pippin. 'I mean, it 
line 31592=>didn't know that I had... ' 
line 31593=>     'Of course not,' said  Gandalf. 'It is two hundred  leagues or  more in 
line 31594=>straight  flight  from Barad-dyr to Orthanc, and even a Nazgyl  would take a  
line 31595=>few hours to fly between  them.  But Saruman certainly looked  in  the Stone  
line 31596=>since the orc-raid, and more of his secret thought, I do not doubt, has been 
line 31597=>read than he  intended. A  messenger has  been sent  to  find out what he is 
line 31598=>doing. And  after what has happened tonight another will come, I think,  and 
line 31599=>swiftly. So Saruman will come to  the last pinch of the vice that he has put 
line 31600=>his  hand in. He has  no captive to  send. He has no Stone to see  with, and 
line 31601=>cannot answer the summons. Sauron will  only  believe that he  is withholding 
line 31602=>the captive and refusing to use the Stone. It will not  help Saruman to tell 
line 31603=>the truth to the messenger. For Isengard may be ruined, yet he is still safe 
line 31604=>in Orthanc. So  whether  he  will  or  no,  he  will appear a rebel. Yet  he 
line 31605=>rejected  us, so as  to  avoid  that very thing! What he will  do in such  a  
line 31606=>plight,  I  cannot guess.  He has power still, I think, while in Orthanc, to 
line 31607=>resist the Nine Riders. He may try to do so. He may try to trap  the Nazgyl, 
line 31608=>or  at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the  air. In  that case 
line 31609=>let Rohan look to its horses!  
line 31610=>
line 31611=>####-     'But I cannot tell how it will fall out, well or ill for us. It may  be 
line 31612=>that the counsels of the Enemy will  be confused,  or hindered by  his wrath 
line 31613=>with Saruman. It  may be that he will learn that  I was there and stood upon 
line 31614=>the stairs of Orthanc-with  hobbits at my tail. Or that  an heir  of Elendil 
line 31615=>lives and stood beside  me. If Wormtongue was not deceived by the  armour of 
line 31616=>Rohan, he would remember Aragorn and the title that he claimed. That is what 
line 31617=>I fear. And so we fly  -- not  from  danger but  into  greater danger.  Every 
line 31618=>stride of Shadowfax bears you nearer to the Land of Shadow, Peregrin Took.' 
line 31619=>     Pippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had 
line 31620=>struck him. Grey land passed under them. 
line 31621=>     'See now!' said Gandalf. 'The Westfold dales  are  opening  before  us.  
line 31622=>Here we come back to the eastward  road. The dark shadow yonder is the 
line 31623=>mouth 
line 31624=>of the  Deeping-coomb. That way lies Aglarond a nd the  Glittering Caves.  Do 
line 31625=>not ask  me about them. Ask Gimli, if you meet again, and for the first time 
line 31626=>you  may  get an answer  longer than you wish.  You  will not see the  caves 
line 31627=>yourself, not on this journey. Soon they will be far behind.' 
line 31628=>     'I thought you were going to stop  at Helm's Deep!' said Pippin. 'Where 
line 31629=>are you going then?' 
line 31630=>     'To Minas Tirith, before the seas of war surround it.' 
line 31631=>     'Oh! And how far is that?' 
line 31632=>     'Leagues  upon  leagues,'  answered  Gandalf.  'Thrice as  far  as  the 
line 31633=>dwellings of King Thjoden, and they are more than a hundred  miles east from 
line 31634=>here, as  the  messengers of  Mordor fly. Shadowfax must run  a longer road.  
line 31635=>Which will prove the swifter? 
line 31636=>     'We  shall ride  now till  daybreak, and that is  some hours away.  Then 
line 31637=>even Shadowfax must  rest, in some hollow of the  hills: at Edoras, I  hope. 
line 31638=>Sleep, if  you can! You  may see the first  glimmer of dawn upon the  golden  
line 31639=>roof of  the house of Eorl. And in two days thence you shall see the  purple 
line 31640=>shadow  of Mount Mindolluin and the  walls of the tower of Denethor white in 
line 31641=>the morning. 
line 31642=>     'Away  now,  Shadowfax!  Run,  greatheart,  run as  you have never  run 
line 31643=>before! Now we are come to the lands  where you were foaled  and every stone 
line 31644=>you know. Run now! Hope is in speed!' 
line 31645=>     Shadowfax tossed his head and cried aloud, as if a trumpet had summoned 
line 31646=>him to battle. Then he sprang forward. Fire flew from his feet; night rushed 
line 31647=>over him. 
line 31648=>
line 31649=>####-     As he  fell  slowly into  sleep, Pippin had a  strange feeling:  he and 
line 31650=>Gandalf  were  still as stone, seated  upon the  statue of a running  horse, 
line 31651=>while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind.

line 31664=>
line 31665=> 
line 31666=> 
line 31667=>     'Well, master,  we're in  a fix and  no mistake,'  sa id Sam  Gamgee. He 
line 31668=>stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside Frodo, and peered out  with 
line 31669=>puckered eyes into the gloom. 
line 31670=>     It was the third evening since they had fled from  the Company,  as far 
line 31671=>as they could  tell:  they had  almost lost count of  the  hours during which 
line 31672=>they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the 
line 31673=>Emyn 
line 31674=>Muil,  sometimes retracing  their  steps  because  they could  find  no  way 
line 31675=>forward,  sometimes discovering  that they  had wandered in a circle back to 
line 31676=>where they  had been hours before. Yet on the whole they had worked steadily 
line 31677=>eastward, keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this 
line 31678=>strange  twisted  knot of hills. But  always  they  found its  outward faces 
line 31679=>sheer,  high  and  impassable, frowning  over  the plain  below;  beyond its 
line 31680=>tumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not  even 
line 31681=>a bird was to be seen. 
line 31682=>     The hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff, bare and bleak, its 
line 31683=>feet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with 
line 31684=>drifting  cloud. A chill wind` blew from the East. Night was gathering  over  
line 31685=>the shapeless  lands before them; the sickly  green of them was fading  to a  
line 31686=>sullen brown. Far away to the right the Anduin, that had gleamed fitfully in 
line 31687=>sun-breaks during the day, was now  hidden in shadow. But their eyes did not 
line 31688=>look beyond the  River,  back to Gondor, to  their friends, to the lands  of 
line 31689=>Men. South and east they stared to where, at the edge of the oncoming night,  
line 31690=>a dark line hung, like distant mountains  of motionless smoke. Every now and 
line 31691=>again a  tiny red gleam far away  flickered upwards on the rim of earth  and 
line 31692=>sky. 
line 31693=>     `What a fix! ' said Sam.  `That's the one place  in all the lands we've 
line 31694=>ever heard of that we  don't want to see any closer; and that's the one place 
line 31695=>we're trying  to  get  to! And  that's just where we can't get, nohow. We've 
line 31696=>come the wrong way altogether, seemingly. We can't get down;  and if  we did 
line 31697=>
line 31698=>####-get down, we'd find all that green land a nasty bog, I'll warrant. Phew! Can 
line 31699=>you smell it?' He sniffed at the wind. 
line 31700=>     'Yes, I can smell  it,'  said Frodo, but he did not move,  and his eyes 
line 31701=>remained fixed, staring out towards the  dark line and the flickering flame. 
line 31702=>`Mordor! ' he muttered under his breath. 'If I  must go there I wish I could 
line 31703=>come there quickly and make an  end! ' He shuddered. The wind was chilly and 
line 31704=>yet heavy with an odour of cold decay.  `Well,' he said, at last withdrawing 
line 31705=>his eyes, `we cannot stay here all night, fix or no fix. We must find a more 
line 31706=>sheltered spot,  and camp once more; and perhaps another  day will show us a 
line 31707=>path.' 
line 31708=>     'Or another and another and another,' muttered Sam.  `Or  maybe no day.  
line 31709=>We've come the wrong way.' 
line 31710=>     'I wonder,' said Frodo. 'It's my  doom, I think, to go  to  that Shadow 
line 31711=>yonder, so that a way will  be found.  But will good or evil show it to  me?  
line 31712=>What hope we had was in speed. Delay plays into the Enemy's hands-and here I 
line 31713=>am: delayed. Is it the will of the Dark Tower that steers us? All my choices 
line 31714=>have proved ill. I should have  left the Company long  before, and come down 
line 31715=>from the North, east of the River and of the Emyn Muil, and so over the hard 
line 31716=>of Battle Plain  to the passes of Mordor. But now it isn't possible  for you  
line 31717=>and me alone to find a way back, and the Orcs are prowling on the east bank. 
line 31718=>Every  day that passes is a precious day lost. I am tired, Sam. I don't know 
line 31719=>what is to be done. What food have we got left?' 
line 31720=>     'Only those, what d'you call 'em, lembas, Mr. Frodo. A fair supply. But 
line 31721=>they are better than naught, by a long bite. I never thought, though, when I 
line 31722=>first set tooth in them, that I should ever come to wish for a change. But I 
line 31723=>do now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug -- aye, half  a mug  -- of beer would 
line 31724=>go down proper. I've lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last  camp, 
line 31725=>and what use  has  it been? Naught  to  make a fire with, for  a start;  and 
line 31726=>naught to cook, not even grass!' 
line 31727=>     They turned  away and went down into a  stony hollow. The westering sun 
line 31728=>was caught into clouds,  and night came swiftly. They slept as  well as they 
line 31729=>could  for the  cold, turn and  turn about,  in a  nook among  great  jagged 
line 31730=>pinnacles of weathered rock; at  least they were sheltered from the easterly 
line 31731=>wind. 
line 31732=>     `Did you see them  again, Mr . Frodo?' asked Sam, as they sat, stiff and 
line 31733=>chilled, munching wafers of  lembas, in the cold grey of early morning. 
line 31734=>     'No,' said Frodo. `I've heard nothing, and seen nothing, for two nights 
line 31735=>
line 31736=>####-now.' 
line 31737=>     `Nor me,' said  Sam. `Grrr!  Those eyes did give me a  turn! But perhaps 
line 31738=>we've shaken  him off at  last, the miserable slinker. Gollum! I'll give him 
line 31739=>gollum in his throat, if ever I get my hands on his neck.' 
line 31740=>     'I  hope  you'll never need to,'  said  Frodo.  `I don't  know  how  he 
line 31741=>followed us; but it may be that  he's lost us again, as you say. In this dry 
line 31742=>bleak  land we  can't leave  many  footprints, nor much scent, even  for his 
line 31743=>snuffling nose.' 
line 31744=>     'I hope that's the way of it,' said Sam. 'I wish we could be rid of him 
line 31745=>for good!' 
line 31746=>     'So do I,' said Frodo; 'but he's not my chief trouble. I wish we  could 
line 31747=>get away from these hills! I hate them. I feel all naked on  the  east side, 
line 31748=>stuck up here with  nothing but  the  dead  flats between me and that Shadow 
line 31749=>yonder. There's an Eye in it. Come on! We've got to get down today somehow.' 
line 31750=>     But  that day wore on, and  when  afternoon faded towards evening  they 
line 31751=>were still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape. 
line 31752=>     Sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied  that they 
line 31753=>heard faint sounds behind  them, a stone falling,  or the  imagined step  of 
line 31754=>flapping feet on the rock. But if they halted  and  stood  still  listening, 
line 31755=>they heard  no more,  nothing but  the  wind sighing over  the  edges of the 
line 31756=>stones -- yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp 
line 31757=>teeth. 
line 31758=>     All that  day  the  outer  ridge of the  Emyn  Muil  had  been  bending 
line 31759=>gradually northward,  as  they  struggled  on.  Along  its  brink there  now 
line 31760=>stretched  a wide tumbled flat of scored and  weathered rock,  cut  every now  
line 31761=>and again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in  
line 31762=>the cliff-face. To find a path in  these clefts, which  were becoming deeper 
line 31763=>and more  frequent, Frodo  and Sam were driven to their left, well away from 
line 31764=>the edge, and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going 
line 31765=>slowly but steadily downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of 
line 31766=>the lowlands. 
line 31767=>     At last  they were brought to a  halt.  The ridge took  a  sharper bend 
line 31768=>nor thward and was gashed by  a deeper  ravine. On the further side it reared 
line 31769=>up again,  many fathoms at a single  leap: a great grey cliff  loomed before 
line 31770=>them, cut sheer down  as if by  a  knife stroke.  They could  go  no further 
line 31771=>forwards, and must turn now either west or east. But west  would  lead  them 
line 31772=>only  into more labour and delay, back towards the  heart of the hills; east 
line 31773=>
line 31774=>####-would take them to the outer precipice. 
line 31775=>     `There's nothing for it but  to scramble down  this gully,  Sam,'  said 
line 31776=>Frodo. `Let's see what it leads to!' 
line 31777=>     'A nasty drop, I'll bet,' said Sam. 
line 31778=>     The  cleft  was  longer and deeper  than it seemed. Some way down  they 
line 31779=>found a  few gnarled and stunted  trees,  the first they  had seen for days: 
line 31780=>twisted birch for  the  most part, with here and there a fir -tree. Many were 
line 31781=>dead and gaunt, bitten to the core by the eastern winds. Once in milder days 
line 31782=>there must have been a fair thicket in the ravine, but now, after some fifty 
line 31783=>yards,  the  trees  came to  an end, though  old broken stumps  straggled on 
line 31784=>almost to the cliff's brink. The bottom of  the  gully, which  lay along the 
line 31785=>edge of a rock -fault, was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply  down. 
line 31786=>When they came at last to the end of it, Frodo stooped and leaned out. 
line 31787=>     `Look!' he said. `We must have come down a  long way, or else the cliff 
line 31788=>has sunk. It's much lower here than it was, and it looks easier too.' 
line 31789=>     Sam knelt beside  him  and peered  reluctantly over the  edge.  Then he 
line 31790=>glanced up at the great  cliff rising up, away on  their left. `Easier! ' he 
line 31791=>grunted. `Well, I  suppose it's always easier getting down than up. Those as 
line 31792=>can't fly can jump!' 
line 31793=>     `It would be a big jump still,' said Frodo. `About, well'  --  he  stood 
line 31794=>for a moment measuring it with his eyes  -- `about eighteen  fathoms I should  
line 31795=>guess. Not more.' 
line 31796=>     'And that's enough! ' said Sam. `Ugh! How I do hate looking down from a 
line 31797=>height! But looking's better than climbing.' 
line 31798=>     `All the same,' said Frodo, `I think  we could climb here; and  I think  
line 31799=>we shall have to try. See -- the rock is quite different from  what it was a  
line 31800=>few miles back. It has slipped and cracked.' 
line 31801=>     The outer fall  was  indeed no  longer  sheer,  but  sloped outwards  a  
line 31802=>little. It looked  like a great rampart or  sea -wall whose  foundations  had 
line 31803=>shifted, so that  its courses were all twisted and disordered, leaving great 
line 31804=>fissures  and  long  slanting edges that were in places  almost as  wide  as 
line 31805=>stairs. 
line 31806=>     `And if we're going to try and  get down, we had better  try  at  once. 
line 31807=>It's getting dark early. I think there's a storm coming.' 
line 31808=>     The smoky  blur of the mountains  in the  East  was  lost  in a  deeper  
line 31809=>blackness that was already reaching out  westwards with long arms. There was 
line 31810=>a distant  mutter of  thunder borne on the rising breeze. Frodo sniffed  the 
line 31811=>
line 31812=>####-air and looked up  doubtfully at the  sky. He strapped his belt  outside his 
line 31813=>cloak  and  tightened it, and settled  his  light pack on  his back; then he 
line 31814=>stepped towards the edge. `I'm going to try it,' he said. 
line 31815=>     `Very good! ' said Sam gloomily. `But I'm going first.' 
line 31816=>     'You? ' said Frodo. `What's made you change your mind about climbing?' 
line 31817=>     'I haven't changed my mind.  But it's only sense: put the one lowest as 
line 31818=>is most  likely to slip. I don't want to come down atop of you a nd knock you  
line 31819=>off no sense in killing two with one fall.' 
line 31820=>     Before Frodo  could  stop  him,  he  sat down,  swung his legs over the 
line 31821=>brink,  and twisted round, scrabbling with  his toes for a  foothold.  It is 
line 31822=>doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood, or more unwise. 
line 31823=>     'No,  no! Sam, you  old ass! ' said Frodo.  `You'll kill  yourself  for  
line 31824=>certain going  over like that without  even a look to see what  to make for. 
line 31825=>Come back! '  He took Sam under  the armpits and hauled him up  again. 'Now,  
line 31826=>wait a bit and be patient! ' he said. Then he lay on the ground, leaning out 
line 31827=>and looking  down: but the light  seemed to be fading quickly, although  the  
line 31828=>sun had not yet set. 'I think we  could manage this,' he  said presently. `I  
line 31829=>could at any rate; and you could too. if you kept your  head and followed me  
line 31830=>carefully.' 
line 31831=>     `I don't know how you can be so sure,' said Sam. `Why! You can't see to 
line 31832=>the bottom in this light. What if you comes to a place where there's nowhere 
line 31833=>to put your feet or your hands?' 
line 31834=>     'Climb back, I suppose,' said Frodo. 
line 31835=>     'Easy said,' objected Sam. 'Better wait till morning and more light.' 
line 31836=>     `No! Not if I can help it,' said Frodo with a sudden strange vehemence. 
line 31837=>`I grudge every hour, every minute. I'm  going down to try it out.  Don't you  
line 31838=>follow till I come back or call!' 
line 31839=>     Gripping  the stony lip of  the  fall with  his fingers he  let himself 
line 31840=>gently down, until when his arms were almost at full stretch, his toes found 
line 31841=>a ledge.  'On_ e step down!  ' he  said. 'And this ledge broadens out to the 
line 31842=>right. I could stand there without a hold. I'll--' his words were cut short. 
line 31843=>     The  hurrying  darkness, now gathering  great speed, rushed up from the 
line 31844=>East and swallowed the sky. There was a dry splitting crack of thunder right  
line 31845=>overhead. Searing  lightning smote down into the hills. Then came a blast of 
line 31846=>savage wind, and with  it, mingling with its  roar, there came a high shrill 
line 31847=>shriek. The hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the Marish as they 
line 31848=>fled  from Hobbiton, and even there  in the woods of the Shire it had frozen 
line 31849=>
line 31850=>####-their blood.  Out  here  in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced 
line 31851=>them  with cold blades of horror and despair, stopping heart and breath. Sam 
line 31852=>fell flat on his face. Involuntarily Frodo loosed his hold and put his hands 
line 31853=>over his head and ears. He swayed,  slipped,  and slithered downwards with a 
line 31854=>wailing cry. 
line 31855=>     Sam  heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge. 'Master, master! 
line 31856=>' he called.  'Master!'.  
line 31857=>     He heard no answer.  He  found he was  shaking all over, but he gathered  
line 31858=>his breath, and once again he shouted: 'Master!' The wind seemed to blow his 
line 31859=>voice back into his throat, but as it passed, roaring up  the gully and away 
line 31860=>over the hills, a faint answering cry came to his ears:  
line 31861=>     'All right, all right! I'm here. But I can't see.' 
line 31862=>     Frodo  was  calling with a  weak voice. ,He  was not actually very  far 
line 31863=>away. He had slid and not fallen, and had come up with a jolt to his feet on 
line 31864=>a wider ledge not  many yards lower down. Fortunately  the  rock -face at this 
line 31865=>point leaned well back and  the  wind had pressed him against the  cliff, so 
line 31866=>that he had not toppled  over. He steadied himself a little, laying his face 
line 31867=>against the cold stone, feeling  his heart pounding. But either the darkness 
line 31868=>had  grown  complete, or else  his eyes had lost  their sight. All was black  
line 31869=>about him. He wondered if he had been struck blind. He took a deep breath.  
line 31870=>     `Come  back!  Come  back! '  he heard Sam's voice out  of the blackness 
line 31871=>above. 
line 31872=>     `I can't,' he said. `I  can't see. I can't find any hold. I can't  move 
line 31873=>yet.' 
line 31874=>     `What  can  I do, Mr. Frodo? What can I do?  ' shouted Sam, leaning out 
line 31875=>dangerously far.  Why could not his master see?  It was dim, certainly,  but 
line 31876=>not as dark as all that. He could see Frodo below him, a grey forlorn figure 
line 31877=>splayed against  the cliff. But  he was far out of the  reach of any helping 
line 31878=>hand. 
line 31879=>     There  was another crack  of  thunder;  and then  the  rain came.  In a  
line 31880=>blinding sheet, mingled with hail, it drove against the cliff, bitter cold. 
line 31881=>     'I'm  coming  down to you,' shouted Sam, though how he hoped to help in 
line 31882=>that way he could not have said. 
line 31883=>     `No,  no!  wait!  ' Frodo  called back, more strongly now. `I  shall be 
line 31884=>better  soon. I feel  better already. Wait! You can't do anything  without a  
line 31885=>rope.' 
line 31886=>     `Rope!'  cried  Sam, talking wildly to himself  in  his  excitement and 
line 31887=>
line 31888=>####-relief. `Well, if I don't deserve  to be hung on the end of one as a warning 
line 31889=>to numbskulls!  You're nowt  but a ninnyhammer, Sam Gamgee: that's  what 
line 31890=>the 
line 31891=>Gaffer said to me often enough, it being a word of his. Rope!' 
line 31892=>     `Stop  chattering!' cried  Frodo,  now  recovered  enough to feel  both 
line 31893=>amused and annoyed. 'Never mind your Gaffer! Are you trying to tell yourself 
line 31894=>you've got some rope in your pocket? If so, out with it! 
line 31895=>     `Yes, Mr. Frodo, in my pack and  all.  Carried it hundreds of miles and 
line 31896=>I'd clean forgotten it!' 
line 31897=>     `Then get busy and let an end down!' 
line 31898=>     Quickly  Sam  unslung  his pack and rummaged in it. There indeed at the 
line 31899=>bottom was a coil  of the silken-grey rope made by the folk  of  Lurien.  He 
line 31900=>cast an end to his master. The darkness seemed to lift from Frodo's eyes, or  
line 31901=>else his sight was returning. He could see the grey line as it came dangling 
line 31902=>down, and he thought it had a faint silver sheen. Now that he had some point  
line 31903=>in the darkness to  fix his eyes on, he felt less giddy. Leaning  his weight 
line 31904=>forward, he made the  end fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line 
line 31905=>with both hands.  
line 31906=>     Sam stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or two from 
line 31907=>the edge.  Half hauled, half scrambling. Frodo came up  and threw himself on 
line 31908=>the ground. 
line 31909=>     Thunder growled  and  rumbled in the distance,  and the rain was  still 
line 31910=>falling heavily. The hobbits crawled away back into the gully; but  they did 
line 31911=>not find  much shelter there.  Rills of water began  to run down;  soon they 
line 31912=>grew to a spate that splashed and fumed on the  stones, and spouted out over  
line 31913=>the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof. 
line 31914=>     `I should have been half drowned down there, or washed clean off,' said 
line 31915=>Frodo. 'What a piece of luck you had that rope!' 
line 31916=>     `Better  luck  if  I'd thought  of  it sooner,'  said Sam.  'Maybe  you  
line 31917=>remember them putting the  ropes in the boats,  as we started  off:  in  the 
line 31918=>elvish country. I took a fancy to it, and  I stowed a coil in my pack. Years 
line 31919=>ago, it seems.  "It may be a help in many needs," he said: Haldir, or one of 
line 31920=>those folk. And he spoke right.' 
line 31921=>     `A  pity I didn't think of bringing another length,' said Frodo; `but I 
line 31922=>left  the  Company in such a hurry and confusion. If  only  we had enough we 
line 31923=>could use it to get down. How long is your rope, I wonder?' 
line 31924=>     Sam paid it out slowly, measuring it with his arms: 'Five, ten, twenty, 
line 31925=>
line 31926=>####-thirty ells, more or less,' he said. 
line 31927=>     'Who'd have  thought it!' Frodo exclaimed. 
line 31928=>     `Ah! Who would? ' said Sam. `Elves are wonderful folk. It looks  a  bit 
line 31929=>thin, but it's tough; and soft as milk to the  hand. Packs close too, and as 
line 31930=>light as light. Wonderful folk to be sure!' 
line 31931=>     `Thirty ells! '  said Frodo considering. 'I believe it would be enough. 
line 31932=>If the storm passes before nightfall, I'm going to try it.' 
line 31933=>     `The rain's nearly  given over already,'  said Sam;  'but  don't you go 
line 31934=>doing anything risky in the  dim again, Mr.  Frodo! And I  haven't  got over 
line 31935=>that shriek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a Black Rider it  sounded-but 
line 31936=>one up in the air, if they can fly.  I'm  thinking we'd  best lay up in this 
line 31937=>crack till night's over.' 
line 31938=>     'And I'm  thinking that I won't spend a moment longer than I need stuck  
line 31939=>up on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking over the marshes,' 
line 31940=>said Frodo. 
line 31941=>     With  that he stood up and went  down to the bottom of the gully again. 
line 31942=>He looked out.  Clear sky  was  growing in the East once more. The skirts of 
line 31943=>the  storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the  main  battle had passed to 
line 31944=>spread its great wings over the Emyn  Muil; upon which  the dark thought  of 
line 31945=>Sauron brooded for a  while.  Thence it turned, smiting  the Vale of  Anduin 
line 31946=>with hail  and lightning,  and  casting its shadow upon  Minas  Tirith  with 
line 31947=>threat  of  war.  Then,  lowering in the mountains,  and gathering its great 
line 31948=>spires,  it rolled on slowly over Gondor  and the skirts of Rohan, until far 
line 31949=>away the Riders on  the plain saw its black towers mov ing behind the sun, as 
line 31950=>they  rode into the West. But here, over the desert and the  reeking marshes 
line 31951=>the  deep  blue sky of  evening  opened once  more, and  a few  pallid stars 
line 31952=>appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent moon. 
line 31953=>     `It's good  to be able to see again,' said Frodo,  breathing  deep. `Do 
line 31954=>you know, I thought for a  bit that I had lost my sight? From  the lightning 
line 31955=>or something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey 
line 31956=>rope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow.' 
line 31957=>     `It does look  sort of silver in the dark,' said Sam. `Never noticed it 
line 31958=>before, though I can't remember as I've ever had it out since I first stowed 
line 31959=>it. But if you're so set on climbing, Mr. Frodo,  how  are you  going to use 
line 31960=>it?  Thirty ells, or  say, about eighteen fathom: that's  no  more than your 
line 31961=>guess at the height of the cliff.' 
line 31962=>     Frodo thought for a while. `Make it fast to that stump, Sam! ' he said. 
line 31963=>
line 31964=>####-`Then I think  you  shall have your wish this time and go first. I'll  lower  
line 31965=>you, and you need do no more than use  your feet and hands  to fend yourself 
line 31966=>off the rock. Though, if you put your weight on  some of the ledges and give 
line 31967=>me a  rest, it will help. When you're down, I'll follow. I feel quite myself 
line 31968=>again now.' 
line 31969=>     'Very well,' said Sam heavily. `If it must be, let's get it  over! ' He 
line 31970=>took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest  to the brink; then 
line 31971=>the  other  end  he tied about  his own waist.  Reluctantly  he  turned  and 
line 31972=>prepared to go over the edge a second time. 
line 31973=>     It did not, however, turn  out half as bad as he had expected. The rope 
line 31974=>seemed  to give him confidence, though he  shut his eyes more than once when 
line 31975=>he looked down between his feet. There was one awkward spot, where there 
line 31976=>was 
line 31977=>no ledge and the wa ll was sheer and even undercut for  a short  space; there 
line 31978=>he slipped and  swung  out on the silver  line. But Frodo lowered him slowly 
line 31979=>and steadily, and  it was over at  last. His  chief  fear had been  that the 
line 31980=>rope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a  
line 31981=>good bight in Frodo's hands, when Sam came to the bottom and called up: `I'm 
line 31982=>down! ' His voice came up clearly from below,  but Frodo could not see  him; 
line 31983=>his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight. 
line 31984=>     Frodo took rather  more time to follow him. He had the  rope  about his 
line 31985=>waist and  it was fast above, and he had shortened it so that it  would pull 
line 31986=>him up before  he  reached the ground; still he did not want to risk a fall, 
line 31987=>and he had not quite  Sam's faith in  this   slender grey line.  He found two 
line 31988=>places, all  the  same,  where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces 
line 31989=>where there was no hold even  for  his strong hobbit  fingers and the ledges 
line 31990=>were far apart. But at last he too was down. 
line 31991=>     `Well!' he cried.  `We've done it! We've escaped from the Emyn Muil! And 
line 31992=>now what next, I  wonder? Maybe we shall soon  be sighing for good hard rock  
line 31993=>under foot again.' 
line 31994=>     But   Sam  did   not  answer:  he  was   staring  back  up  the  cliff.  
line 31995=>`Ninnyhammers!  ' he said. `Noodles! My beautiful rope! There it is tied to a  
line 31996=>stump,  and  we're  at the  bottom.  Just  as  nice a little stair for  that 
line 31997=>slinking Gollum as we could leave. Better put up a signpost to say which way 
line 31998=>we've gone! I thought it seemed a bit too easy.' 
line 31999=>     `If you can think of any way  we could have both used the rope and  yet 
line 32000=>brought  it down with  us, then you  can  pass on to me ninnyhammer, or  any 
line 32001=>
line 32002=>####-other name your Gaffer gave you,' said Frodo. `Climb up and untie it and let  
line 32003=>yourself down, if you want to! ' 
line 32004=>     Sam scratched his head. `No,  I can't think how, begging  your pardon,' 
line 32005=>he  said. `But I don't like leaving it, and that's  a fact.' He  stroked the 
line 32006=>rope's  end  and  shook  it  gently.  `It goes  hard parting with anything I 
line 32007=>brought  out  of  the  Elf-country. Made  by Galadriel herself, too,  maybe. 
line 32008=>Galadriel,' he murmured  nodding his head  mournfully. He looked up and gave 
line 32009=>one last pull to the rope as if in farewell. 
line 32010=>     To  the  complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose. Sam  fell 
line 32011=>over, and the long grey coils slithered silently down  on top  of him. Frodo 
line 32012=>laughed. `Who  tied the rope? ' he said. `A good thing it held as long as it 
line 32013=>did! To think that I trusted all my weight to your knot!' 
line 32014=>     Sam did not laugh. `I may not be much good at climbing, Mr.  Frodo,' he 
line 32015=>said in injured tones, `but I do know something  about rope and about knots.  
line 32016=>It's in the family, as you might  say. Why, my grand-dad, and my  uncle Andy 
line 32017=>after him, him that  was the Gaffer's eldest brother he had a rope-walk over 
line 32018=>by Tighfield many a year.  And I put as fast a hitch  over the  stump as any 
line 32019=>one could have done, in the Shire or out of it.' 
line 32020=>     `Then the rope must have broken  -- frayed on the rock -edge, I expect,' 
line 32021=>said Frodo. 
line 32022=>     `I bet it didn't! ' said Sam in an  even more injured voice. He stooped 
line 32023=>and examined the ends. `Nor it hasn't neither. Not a strand!' 
line 32024=>     'Then I'm afraid it must have been the knot,' said Frodo. 
line 32025=>     Sam shook his  head and did not answer. He was passing the rope through 
line 32026=>his  fingers  thoughtfully. `Have it  your own way, Mr.  Frodo,' he  said at 
line 32027=>last, `but I think the  rope came off itself  -- when I called.' He coiled it 
line 32028=>up and stowed it lovingly in his pack. 
line 32029=>     'It certainly came,' said Frodo, `and that's the  chief thing.  But now 
line 32030=>we've got to think of our next move. Night will be on us soon. How beautiful 
line 32031=>the stars are, and the Moon!' 
line 32032=>     'They do cheer  the heart, don't they?  ' said Sam looking up.  'Elvish 
line 32033=>they  are. somehow. And the Moon's growing. We haven't  seen him for a night 
line 32034=>or two in this cloudy weather. He's beginning to give quite a light.' 
line 32035=>     'Yes,' said Frodo; `but he  won't be full for some  days. I don't think  
line 32036=>we'll try the marshes by the light of half a moon.' 
line 32037=>     Under the first shadows of night they started  out on the next stage of 
line 32038=>their journey. After  a while Sam turned and looked back at the way they had 
line 32039=>
line 32040=>####-come. The mouth  of the gully was a black notch in the  dim cliff. `I'm glad 
line 32041=>we've got  the rope,' he said. 'We've set a little puzzle for  that footpad, 
line 32042=>anyhow. He can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges!' 
line 32043=>     They  picked  their  steps away from the  skirts of the cliff,  among a  
line 32044=>wilderness of boulders  and  rough stones, wet  and slippery with the  heavy  
line 32045=>rain.  The ground still fell  away  sharply. They had not gone very far when 
line 32046=>they came upon a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet. 
line 32047=>It was not wide,  but it was too wide to  jump across in the dim light. They 
line 32048=>thought they  could hear water  gurgling in  its  depths. It curved  away  on 
line 32049=>their  left  northward, back  towards the hills. and so barred their road in 
line 32050=>that direction, at any rate while darkness lasted. 
line 32051=>     'We had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff, I 
line 32052=>think,'  said  Sam.  `We might  find some  nook  there, or  even  a cave  or  
line 32053=>something.' 
line 32054=>     'I  suppose so,'  said  Frodo.  'I'm tired.  and  I don't  think I  can 
line 32055=>scramble among stones much  longer tonight --  though  I grudge the delay. I 
line 32056=>wish there was a clear path in front of us: then I'd go on till my legs gave 
line 32057=>way.' 
line 32058=>     They did not find the going  any easier at the  broken feet of the Emyn 
line 32059=>Muil. Nor did Sam find any nook  or hollow  to shelter in: only  bare  stony 
line 32060=>slopes frowned  over  by the  cliff, which  now rose again, higher  and more 
line 32061=>sheer as they went back. In the end, worn out, they  just cast themselves on 
line 32062=>the ground  under the lee  of a boulder lying not far  from the foot of  the 
line 32063=>precipice. There  for some time  they sat huddled mournfully together in the 
line 32064=>cold stony night, while sleep crept  upon them in spite of all they could do 
line 32065=>to hold it off.  The moon now rode high and  clear. Its thin white light lit 
line 32066=>up the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff, 
line 32067=>turning  all the wide  looming darkness into a   chill  pale grey scored with 
line 32068=>black shadows. 
line 32069=>     'Well! '  said  Frodo, standing up and drawing  his cloak more  closely 
line 32070=>round him.  `You  sleep for a bit Sam and take my blanket.  I'll walk up and 
line 32071=>down on sentry for a while.' Suddenly he stiffened,  and stooping he gripped  
line 32072=>Sam by the  arm. `What's  that?  '  he whispered. `Look  over  there on  the 
line 32073=>cliff!' 
line 32074=>     Sam looked and breathed in  sharply through his teeth. `Ssss!' he said. 
line 32075=>'That's what it is. It's that Gollum! Snakes and adders! And to think tha t I 
line 32076=>thought that  we'd puzzle him with our bit of a climb! Look at  him!  Like a  
line 32077=>
line 32078=>####-nasty crawling spider on a wall.' 
line 32079=>     Down the face of a precipice, sheer  and almost smooth it seemed in the 
line 32080=>pale moonlight, a small black shape was moving with its thin  limbs  splayed 
line 32081=>out. Maybe its soft clinging  hands and toes were finding crevices and holds 
line 32082=>that no hobbit could ever have seen or used, but it looked as if it was just  
line 32083=>creeping down on sticky pads, like some large prowling thing of insect-kind.  
line 32084=>And it was coming down  head  first, as  if it was smelling its way. Now and 
line 32085=>again it lifted its head slowly, turning  it  right back on  its long skinny 
line 32086=>neck, and the hobbits  caught  a glimpse of two small pale gleaming  lights,  
line 32087=>its eyes that blinked at the moon  for a moment and then were quickly lidded  
line 32088=>again. 
line 32089=>     `Do you think he can see us? ' said Sam. 
line 32090=>     `I don't know,' said Frodo  quietly, `but I think not. It  is hard even 
line 32091=>for friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: I cannot  see you in the shadow 
line 32092=>even at a  few paces. And I've heard that he doesn't like Sun or Moon.' 
line 32093=>     `Then why is he coming down just here? ' asked Sam. 
line 32094=>     'Quietly, Sam! ' said Frodo. `He can smell us, perhaps. And he can hear 
line 32095=>as keen as  Elves, I believe. I think he has heard something  now: our voices 
line 32096=>probably. We did a lot of shouting  away back there; and we were talking far 
line 32097=>too loudly until a minute ago.' 
line 32098=>     `Well, I'm sick of him,' said Sam. `He's come once too often for me and 
line 32099=>I'm going to have a word with him, if I can. I don't suppose  we  could give 
line 32100=>him the slip  now anyway.' Drawing his grey  hood well  over  his  face, Sam 
line 32101=>crept stealthily towards the cliff.  
line 32102=>     `Careful!' whispered Frodo coming behind.  `Don't  alarm him! He's much 
line 32103=>more dangerous than he looks.' 
line 32104=>     The black crawling shape was now three-quarters  of  the way down,  and 
line 32105=>perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliff's  foot. Crouching stone-still in 
line 32106=>the shadow of a large  boulder the hobbits watched him.  He seemed  to  have 
line 32107=>come  to a  difficult passage or  to be troubled about something. They could  
line 32108=>hear him snuffling, and now and again there was a harsh  hiss of breath that 
line 32109=>sounded like  a curse. He lifted his head, and they  thought  they heard him 
line 32110=>spit. Then  he  moved on again. Now they could hear  his voice creaking  and 
line 32111=>whistling. 
line 32112=>     `Ach,  sss! Cautious, my precious! More haste  less speed.  We musstn't 
line 32113=>rissk our neck, musst we, precious? No, precious  -- gollum!'  He lifted his 
line 32114=>head again, blinked at the moon, and quickly shut his eyes. `We hate it,' he 
line 32115=>
line 32116=>####-hissed.  `Nassty,  nassty shivery light it is  -- sss  --  it  spies on  us,  
line 32117=>precious -- it hurts our eyes.' 
line 32118=>     He was getting  lower now and the  hisses became  sharper  and clearer. 
line 32119=>'Where iss it, where iss it: my Precious, my Precious? It's ours, it is, and 
line 32120=>we wants it. The thieves, the thieves, the filthy  little thieves. Where are 
line 32121=>they with my Precious? Curse them! We hates them.' 
line 32122=>     `It doesn't sound as if he knew we were here, does it? ' whispered Sam. 
line 32123=>`And what's his Precious? Does he mean the' 
line 32124=>     `Hsh!  ' breathed  Frodo. 'He's getting near now, near enough to hear a  
line 32125=>whisper.' 
line 32126=>     Indeed Gollum  had suddenly paused again,  and his  large  head on  its 
line 32127=>scrawny neck was  lolling from side to side as if he was listening. His pale 
line 32128=>eyes were  half  unlidded. Sam restrained  himself, though his fingers  were 
line 32129=>twitching. His  eyes,  filled with anger  and  disgust,  were  fixed  on the 
line 32130=>wretched  creature as  he  now  began  to  move again,  still whispering and 
line 32131=>hissing to himself.  
line 32132=>     At last he wa s no more than a  dozen  feet from the ground, right above 
line 32133=>their  heads. From that  point  there  was a sheer  drop, for  the cliff was 
line 32134=>slightly undercut,  and  even Gollum could not find a hold of any  kind.  He 
line 32135=>seemed to be trying to twist round, so  as to go legs  first, when  suddenly 
line 32136=>with a shrill whistling shriek he fell. As he did so, he curled his legs and 
line 32137=>arms up round him, like a spider whose descending thread is snapped. 
line 32138=>     Sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the  space between him 
line 32139=>and the cliff foot in  a couple of leaps. Before Gollum could get up, he was 
line 32140=>on top of him.  But he  found Gollum more than he bargained for, even  taken 
line 32141=>like that,  suddenly, off  his guard after  a  fall. Before Sam  could get a  
line 32142=>hold, long legs  and arms  were  wound round  him  pinning  his  arms, and a  
line 32143=>clinging grip, soft  but  horribly  strong, was  squeezing  him  like slowly  
line 32144=>tightening  cords;  clammy fingers were feeling for  his throat.  Then sharp 
line 32145=>teeth bit into his shoulder. All he could do was to butt his hard round head 
line 32146=>sideways into  the creature's face. Gollum hissed and spat, but  he did  not 
line 32147=>let go. 
line 32148=>     Things  would have gone  ill with  Sam, if he had been alone. But Frodo 
line 32149=>sprang  up, and drew  Sting from its sheath. With his left hand he drew back  
line 32150=>Gollum's head by his thin lank hair, stretching  his long neck, and  forcing 
line 32151=>his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky. 
line 32152=>     `Let go! Gollum,' he said. `This is Sting. You have seen it before once 
line 32153=>
line 32154=>####-upon a time. Let go, or you'll feel it this time! I'll cut your throat.' 
line 32155=>     Gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string. Sam got up, fingering 
line 32156=>his  shoulder.  His eyes  smouldered  with  anger, but  he could  not avenge 
line 32157=>himself: his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering. 
line 32158=>     `Don't hurt  us! Don't let them hurt us,  precious! They won't hurt  us 
line 32159=>will they, nice little hobbitses?  We didn't mean no harm, but they jumps on 
line 32160=>us like cats on poor mices, they did, precious. And we're so lonely, gollum. 
line 32161=>We'll be nice to them, very nice, if they'll be  nice to  us, won't we, yes, 
line 32162=>yess.' 
line 32163=>     `Well, what's to be done with it? '  said  Sam.  `Tie  it up, so  as it 
line 32164=>can't come sneaking after us no more, I say.' 
line 32165=>     `But  that would kill  us, kill  us,'  whimpered  Gollum. `Cruel little 
line 32166=>hobbitses. Tie us up in the cold hard lands  and leave us,  gollum, gollum. ' 
line 32167=>Sobs welled up in his gobbling throat. 
line 32168=>     `No,'  said Frodo. `If we kill him, we  must kill him outright. But  we 
line 32169=>can't do that, not as things are. Poor wretch! He has done us no harm.' 
line 32170=>     `Oh hasn't  he! ' said Sam rubbing his  shoulder.  `Anyway he meant to, 
line 32171=>and he means to, I'll warrant. Throttle us in our sleep, that's his plan.' 
line 32172=>     'I daresay,' said Frodo. `But what he means  to  do is another matter.' 
line 32173=>He paused for  a while in thought. Gollum lay still, but stopped whimpering. 
line 32174=>Sam stood glowering over him. 
line 32175=>     It seemed  to Frodo  then  that he  heard,  quite  plainly but far off,  
line 32176=>voices out of the past: 
line 32177=>     What a pity Bilbo did not stub the vile creature, when he had a chance! 
line 32178=>     Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and  Mercy: not to strike 
line 32179=>without need. 
line 32180=>     I do not feel any pity for Gollum. He deserves death. 
line 32181=>     Deserves  death! I daresay  he does. Many that live  deserve death. And 
line 32182=>some die that deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too eager 
line 32183=>to  deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even 
line 32184=>the wise cannot see all ends. 
line 32185=>     `Very well,' he answered aloud, lowering  his  sword. 'But  still  I am 
line 32186=>afraid. And yet, as you see,  I will not touch  the creature. For now that I 
line 32187=>see him, I do pity him.' 
line 32188=>     Sam stared at his master, who seemed to be speaking to some one who was 
line 32189=>not there. Gollum lifted his head. 
line 32190=>     'Yess,  wretched we are,  precious,' he whined. 'Misery misery! Hobbits 
line 32191=>
line 32192=>####-won't kill us, nice hobbits.' 
line 32193=>     'No,  we won't,'  said Frodo. `But we won't  let you go, either. You're 
line 32194=>full  of  wickedness and  mischief, Gollum. You will  have to come with  us,  
line 32195=>that's all, while we keep an eye on you. But you must help us, if  you  can. 
line 32196=>One good turn deserves another.' 
line 32197=>     'Yess, yes indeed,' said Gollum sitting up. 'Nice hobbits! We will come 
line 32198=>with them. Find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. And where are they 
line 32199=>going in these cold hard  lands, we  wonders, yes we wonders? ' He looked up 
line 32200=>at them, and a faint  light of cunning  and eagerness flickered for a second 
line 32201=>in his pale blinking eyes. 
line 32202=>     Sam scowled at him,  and sucked his  teeth; but he seemed to sense that 
line 32203=>there was  something  odd  about his master's  mood and that the  matter was 
line 32204=>beyond argument. All the same he was amazed at Frodo's reply. 
line 32205=>     Frodo  looked straight into Gollum's eyes  which  flinched  and twisted 
line 32206=>away. `You know that, or  you guess  well enough, Smjagol,' he said. quietly 
line 32207=>and sternly. `We are going to Mordor, of course. And you know the way there, 
line 32208=>I believe.' 
line 32209=>     `Ach! sss! ' said Gollum, covering his  ears with his hands, as if such 
line 32210=>frankness, and the open speaking of the names, hurt him. `We guessed, yes we 
line 32211=>guessed,' he  whispered;  `and we didn't  want  them  to  go,  did  we?  No, 
line 32212=>precious, not the nice hobbits. Ashes, ashes, and dust, and thirst there is;  
line 32213=>and pits, pits, pits, and Orcs, thousands of Orcses. Nice hobbits mustn't go 
line 32214=>to -- sss  -- those places.' 
line 32215=>     `So you have been there?  ' Frodo insisted. `And you're being drawn back  
line 32216=>there, aren't you?' 
line 32217=>     `Yess. Yess. No! ' shrieked Gollum. `Once, by  accident it  was, wasn't  
line 32218=>it, precious? Yes, by accident. But we won't go back, no, no!' Then suddenly  
line 32219=>his voice and language changed,  and he sobbed in his throat,  and spoke but 
line 32220=>not to them. `Leave me alone, gollum! You hurt me.  O my poor hands, gollum! 
line 32221=>I,  we, I don't want  to come back. I can't find it. I am tired. I, we can't  
line 32222=>find it, gollum, gollum,  no, nowhere. They 're always awake.  Dwarves,  Men, 
line 32223=>and Elves, terrible Elves  with  bright eyes. I can't find it. Ach! ' He got 
line 32224=>up and clenched his long hand into a bony fleshless knot, shaking it towards 
line 32225=>the East. 'We  won't! ' he  cried. 'Not for  you.' Then he collapsed   again. 
line 32226=>'Gollum, gollum,' he whimpered with his face  to the  ground. 'Don't look at 
line 32227=>us! Go away! Go to sleep!' 
line 32228=>     `He will not go  away or go to sleep at  your  command, Smjagol,'  said 
line 32229=>
line 32230=>####-Frodo. `But if you  really wish to be free of  him again. then you  must help 
line 32231=>me. And that I fear means finding us a path towards him. But you need not go 
line 32232=>all the way, not beyond the gates of his land.' 
line 32233=>     Gollum sat up  again  and looked at him under  his eyelids. 'He's  over  
line 32234=>there,' he cackled. `Always there. Orcs  wi ll take you all the  way. Easy to 
line 32235=>find Orcs east of  the River. Don't ask Smjagol. Poor, poor Smjagol, he went  
line 32236=>away long ago. They took his Precious, and he's lost now.' 
line 32237=>     `Perhaps we'll find him again, if you come with us,' said Frodo. 
line 32238=>     'No, no, never! He's lost his Precious,' said Gollum. 
line 32239=>     'Get up! ' said Frodo. 
line 32240=>     Gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff. 
line 32241=>     `Now! '  said Frodo. 'Can  you find  a path easier by day or by  night?  
line 32242=>We're tired; but if you choose the night, we'll star t tonight.' 
line 32243=>     `The big lights hurt our eyes, they do,' Gollum whined. `Not  under the 
line 32244=>White  Face, not  yet. It will go behind  the  hills soon, yess. Rest  a bit 
line 32245=>first, nice hobbits!' 
line 32246=>     `Then sit down,' said Frodo, `and don't move!' 
line 32247=>     The  hobbits  seated themselves  beside  him, one on  either side. with 
line 32248=>their backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. There was no need for any 
line 32249=>arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. Slowly 
line 32250=>the moon went by. Shadows fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before 
line 32251=>them. The stars grew thick  and bright in  the sky  above.  No one  stirred. 
line 32252=>Gollum  sat  with his legs drawn up, knees  under chin, flat hands  and feet 
line 32253=>splayed on the ground,  his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking 
line 32254=>or listening. 
line 32255=>     Frodo looked across at Sam. Their eyes met and  they  understood.  They 
line 32256=>relaxed,  leaning  their heads back, and  shutting their eyes or seeming to. 
line 32257=>Soon  the sound of  their  soft  breathing  could be  heard. Gollum's  hands 
line 32258=>twitched  a little. Hardly perceptibly his head moved  to  the left  and the 
line 32259=>right, and  first one eye and then the other opened a slit. The hobbits made 
line 32260=>no sign. 
line 32261=>     Suddenly,  with startling agility and  speed, straight  off  the ground 
line 32262=>with a jump like a  grasshopper or a frog. Gollum  bounded  forward into the  
line 32263=>darkness. But that was just what Frodo and Sam had expected.  Sam was on 
line 32264=>him 
line 32265=>before he had gone two paces after  his spring. Frodo coming behind  grabbed 
line 32266=>his leg and threw him. 
line 32267=>
line 32268=>####-     'Your rope might prove useful again, Sam.' he said. 
line 32269=>     Sam  got  out the  rope. 'And  where were you  off  to in the cold hard 
line 32270=>lands, Mr. Gollum?' he growled. 'We wonders.  aye,  we wonders. To find 
line 32271=>some 
line 32272=>of  your orc-friends,  I warrant. You nasty treacherous creature. It's round 
line 32273=>your neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.' 
line 32274=>     Gollum lay quiet and tried  no further tricks.  He did not  answer Sam, 
line 32275=>but gave him a swift venomous look. 
line 32276=>     `All we need is something to keep a hold on him,' said Frodo. 'We  want 
line 32277=>him  to walk, so it's  no good  tying his legs-or his arms. he seems to  use 
line 32278=>them nearly as much. Tie one end to his  ankle, and keep a grip on the other  
line 32279=>end.' 
line 32280=>     He  stood over Gollum, while Sam  tied the  knot. The  result surprised 
line 32281=>them both. Gollum  began to scream, a thin, tearing sound, very  horrible to 
line 32282=>hear. He writhed, and tried to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope.  
line 32283=>He kept on screaming. 
line 32284=>     At last Frodo was  convinced that  he really was  in pain; but it could 
line 32285=>not be from the knot. He examined it  and found that  it was not too  tight, 
line 32286=>indeed  hardly  tight  enough. Sam was gentler than his words.  'What's  the 
line 32287=>matter with you? ' he said. `If you will try to run away. you must  be tied;  
line 32288=>but we don't wish to hurt you.' 
line 32289=>     'It hurts us, it hurts us,' hissed Gollum. `It freezes, it bites! Elves 
line 32290=>twisted it,  curse them! Nasty cruel hobbits! That's why we tries to escape, 
line 32291=>of course  it is, precious.  We guessed they were cruel hobbits. They visits 
line 32292=>Elves, fierce Elves with bright eyes. Take it off us! It hurts us.' 
line 32293=>     `No, I will not take it off you,' said Frodo, `not unless' -- he paused 
line 32294=>a  moment in thought -- `not unless there is any promise you can make that I  
line 32295=>can trust.' 
line 32296=>     'We  will swear to  do what he wants,  yes, yess,  said  Gollum,  still 
line 32297=>twisting and grabbling at his ankle. `It hurts us.' 
line 32298=>     `Swear? ' said Frodo. 
line 32299=>     'Smjagol,' said  Gollum suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and 
line 32300=>staring at Frodo with a strange light. 'Smjagol will swear on the Precious.' 
line 32301=>     Frodo drew himself up, and again  Sam was startled by his words and his 
line 32302=>stern voice. 'On the Precious? How dare you? ' he said. 'Think! 
line 32303=>     One Ring to rule them all and in the Darkness bind them. 
line 32304=>     Would you  commit your promise to that, Smjagol? It  will hold you. But 
line 32305=>
line 32306=>####-it is more treacherous than you are. It may twist your words. Beware!' 
line 32307=>     Gollum cowered. 'On the Precious. on the Precious! ' he repeated. 
line 32308=>     `And what would you swear? ' asked Frodo. 
line 32309=>     `To be very very good,' said Gollum.  Then crawling to Frodo's  feet he 
line 32310=>grovelled before him, whispering hoarsely: a shudder ran over him, as if the 
line 32311=>words shook his very  bones with fear. 'Smjagol will swear never,  never, to 
line 32312=>let Him  have  it.  Never! Smjagol will save  it. But  he  must swear on the 
line 32313=>Precious.' 
line 32314=>     'No! not on it,' said Frodo, looking  down at him with stern pity. 'All 
line 32315=>you wish is  to see it and touch it, if  you can,  though you know  it would 
line 32316=>drive you mad. Not on it. Swear by it,  if you  will. For you know  where it 
line 32317=>is. Yes,  you know, Smjagol. It is before you.' 
line 32318=>     For  a moment it appeared to Sam that  his master had  grown and Gollum 
line 32319=>had shrunk: a  tall stern shadow, a mighty lord  who hid  his  brightness in 
line 32320=>grey cloud, and at his feet  a little whining  dog. Yet the two were in some 
line 32321=>way akin and not alien: they could reach one another's  minds. Gollum raised 
line 32322=>himself and began pawing at Frodo, fawning at his knees. 
line 32323=>     'Down! down! ' said Frodo. `Now speak your promise!' 
line 32324=>     `We promises, yes I promise!' said Gollum. 'I  will serve the  master of 
line 32325=>the Precious. Good master, good Smjagol, gollum, gollum!' Suddenly he  began 
line 32326=>to weep and bite at his ankle again. 
line 32327=>     'Take the rope off, Sam!' said Frodo. 
line 32328=>     Reluctantly Sam obeyed. At once Gollum got up and began prancing about, 
line 32329=>like a whipped cur  whose master  has patted it. From  that moment a change, 
line 32330=>which lasted for some time,  came over him. He spoke  with less  hissing and 
line 32331=>whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He 
line 32332=>would  cringe and  flinch,  if  they stepped  near  him or  made any  sudden 
line 32333=>movement,  and  he  avoided  the  touch of  their elven-cloaks; but  he  was 
line 32334=>friendly,  and  indeed pitifully anxious  to  please.  He would cackle  with 
line 32335=>laughter and caper, if any jest was made, or even  if Frodo  spoke kindly to 
line 32336=>him, and weep if Frodo rebuked  him. Sam said little to  him of any sort. He 
line 32337=>suspected him more  deeply than ever,  and if possible liked the new Gollum, 
line 32338=>the Smjagol, less than the old. 
line 32339=>     'Well, Gollum, or whatever it is we're to call you,' he  said. 'now for 
line 32340=>it! The Moon's gone. and the night's going. We'd better start.' 
line 32341=>     'Yes, yes,' agreed Gollum, skipping about. 'Off we go! There's only one 
line 32342=>way across between the North-end and the South-end. I found it, I  did. Orcs 
line 32343=>
line 32344=>####-don't use it,  Orcs  don't know  it.  Orcs don't cross the  Marshes, they go 
line 32345=>round for miles and  miles. Very  lucky  you  came  this way. Very lucky you 
line 32346=>found Smjagol, yes. Follow Smjagol!' 
line 32347=>     He took  a few  steps away  and  looked  back  inquiringly,  like a dog 
line 32348=>inviting  them for  a  walk. 'Wait a bit, Gollum!'  cried Sam. `Not too  far 
line 32349=>ahead now! I'm going to be at your tail, and I've got the rope handy.' 
line 32350=>     'No, no! ' said Gollum. 'Smjagol promised.' 
line 32351=>     In the  deep of night under hard  clear stars they set  off. Gollum led 
line 32352=>them back northward for a while along the way they had come; then he slanted 
line 32353=>to  the right away from  the steep edge  of the Emyn Muil,  down  the broken 
line 32354=>stony slopes towards the vast fens below. They faded swiftly and softly into  
line 32355=>the darkness. Over all the leagues of waste before the gates of Mordor there 
line 32356=>was a black silence. 
line 32357=> 
line 32358=>
line 32359=>####- 
line 32360=>
line 32361=>Chapter 2. The Passage of the Marshes 
line 32362=>
line 32363=> 
line 32364=> 
line 32365=>     Gollum moved  quickly,  with his  head and  neck  thrust forward, often 
line 32366=>using  his hands as well as his  feet. Frodo  and  Sam were hard put to it to 
line 32367=>keep up with  him; but he seemed  no longer to have any thought of escaping, 
line 32368=>and if they fell  behind, he  would turn and wait for  them. After a time he 
line 32369=>brought  them to the brink of the narrow gully that they   had struck before; 
line 32370=>but they were now further from the hills. 
line 32371=>     `Here it  is!'  he cried.  'There is  a  way down inside, yes.  Now  we 
line 32372=>follows it  -- out,  out away over there.' He pointed south and east  towards 
line 32373=>the marshes. The reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in 
line 32374=>the cool night air. . 
line 32375=>     Gollum  cast up and down along the  brink,  and at length he  called to 
line 32376=>them.  `Here! We can get down here. Smjagol went  this way once: I went this 
line 32377=>way, hiding from Orcs.' 
line 32378=>     He led the way, and following him  the  hobbits climbed  down into  the 
line 32379=>gloom. It  was  not difficult,  for  the  rift was at this  point only  some 
line 32380=>fifteen feet deep and about  a dozen across. There  was running water at the 
line 32381=>bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled 
line 32382=>down  from the  hills to feed  the  stagnant pools and mires beyond.  Gollum 
line 32383=>turned to the  right, southward  more  or less, and splashed  along with his 
line 32384=>feet in the  shallow  stony stream. He seemed greatly  delighted to feel the 
line 32385=>water, and chuckled to himself, sometimes even croaking in a sort of song. 
line 32386=>     The cold hard lands, 
line 32387=>     they bites our hands, 
line 32388=>     they gnaws our feet. 
line 32389=>     The rocks and stones 
line 32390=>     are like old bones 
line 32391=>     all bare of meat. 
line 32392=>     But stream and pool 
line 32393=>     is wet and cool: 
line 32394=>     so nice for feet! 
line 32395=>     And now we wish -- 
line 32396=>     'Ha! ha! What does we wish?' he said,  looking sidelong at the hobbits.  
line 32397=>'We'll tell you.' he croaked. `He  guessed it long ago, Baggins guessed it.' 
line 32398=>A glint  came  into his  eyes, and Sam  catching the gleam in  the  darkness 
line 32399=>
line 32400=>####-thought it far from pleasant. 
line 32401=>     Alive without breath; 
line 32402=>     as cold as death; 
line 32403=>     never thirsting, ever drinking; 
line 32404=>     clad in mail, never clinking. 
line 32405=>     Drowns on dry land, 
line 32406=>     thinks an island 
line 32407=>     is a  mountain; 
line 32408=>     thinks a fountain  
line 32409=>     is a puff of air. 
line 32410=>     So sleek, so fair! 
line 32411=>     What a joy to meet! 
line 32412=>     We only wish 
line 32413=>     to catch a fish, 
line 32414=>     so juicy-sweet! 
line 32415=>     These  words only made  more pressing to Sam's mind a problem that  had 
line 32416=>been  troubl ing him  from the moment when he  understood that hir master was 
line 32417=>going  to adopt Gollum as a guide: the problem of food. It  did not occur to 
line 32418=>him that his master might also  have thought of  it. hut he  supposed Gollum 
line 32419=>had.  Indeed how had Gollum kept  himself  in all his lonely wandering? 'Not 
line 32420=>too well,'  thought Sam. 'He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what 
line 32421=>hobbit tastes like  if there ain't  no  fish, I'll wager -- supposing  as he 
line 32422=>could catch us napping. Well, he won't: not Sam Gamgee for one. ' 
line 32423=>     They stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it 
line 32424=>seemed to the tired feet of Frodo and Sam. The gully turned eastward, and as 
line 32425=>they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above  
line 32426=>grew faint with the  first  grey  of morning. Gollum  had shown  no signs of 
line 32427=>tiring, but now he looked up and halted. 
line 32428=>     `Day  is near,'  he whispered,  as  if  Day  was  something  that might 
line 32429=>overhear  him and spring on  him. `Smjagol will stay here: I will stay here, 
line 32430=>and the Yellow Face won't see me.' 
line 32431=>     `We should be glad to see the Sun;' said Frodo, `but we will stay here: 
line 32432=>we are too tired to go any further at present.' 
line 32433=>     `You are not  wise  to  be glad of the  Yellow Face,' said  Gollum. `It 
line 32434=>shows you up. Nice sensible hobbits stay with Smjagol. Orcs and nasty things 
line 32435=>are about. They can see a long way. Stay and hide with me! ' 
line 32436=>     The three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of 
line 32437=>
line 32438=>####-the gully.  It was not much more than a  tall man's  height now,  and at its 
line 32439=>base there were wide flat shelves  of dry stone; the water ran in a  channel 
line 32440=>on  the  other side. Frodo and Sam sat  on one of  the  flats, resting their 
line 32441=>backs. Gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream. 
line 32442=>     `We must  take a little food,' said Frodo. `Are you hungry, Smjagol? We 
line 32443=>have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.' 
line 32444=>     At the word hungry a greenish light  was kindled in Gollum's pale eyes,  
line 32445=>and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. For  
line 32446=>a  moment  he  relapsed into his old  Gollum-manner. 'We are famisshed,  yes 
line 32447=>famisshed we are. precious,' he  said. `What is it they eats? Have they nice 
line 32448=>fisshes? ' His tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth. licking his 
line 32449=>colourless lips.  
line 32450=>     `No, we have  got no fish,' said Frodo. `We have only  got this'  -- he 
line 32451=>held up a wafer of lembas -- 'and water, if the water here is fit to drink.' 
line 32452=>     `Yess,  yess,  nice water,' said  Gollum. `Drink it, drink it, while we 
line 32453=>can! But what is it they've got, pr ecious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty? ' 
line 32454=>     Frodo  broke  off a portion  of a wafer  and handed it  to him  on  its 
line 32455=>leaf-wrapping. Gollum  sniffed at the leaf and  his face changed: a spasm of 
line 32456=>disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. `Smjagol smells it! ' he 
line 32457=>said. `Leaves out of the elf-country,  gah! They stinks. He climbed in those 
line 32458=>trees,  and  he  couldn't  wash  the  smell  off  his hands, my nice hands.' 
line 32459=>Dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the   lembas  and nibbled it. He spat, 
line 32460=>and a fit  of coughing shook him. 
line 32461=>     `Ach! No!  '  he spluttered. `You try to  choke poor Smjagol.  Dust and 
line 32462=>ashes, he can't eat that. He must  starve. But  Smjagol  doesn't  mind. Nice 
line 32463=>hobbits! Smjagol has promised.  He will  starve. He can't eat hobbits' food. 
line 32464=>He will starve. Poor thin Smjagol! ' 
line 32465=>     `I'm sorry,' said Frodo; `but I can't help  you, I'm  afraid.  I  think  
line 32466=>this  food would do you good, if  you would try. But perhaps  you can't even  
line 32467=>try, not yet anyway.' 
line 32468=>     The hobbits munched their  lembas in silence. Sam thought that it tasted 
line 32469=>far better, somehow, than  it had for a  good while: Gollum's behaviour  had 
line 32470=>made him  attend to its flavour  again.  But  he did  not  feel comfortable. 
line 32471=>Gollum  watched every morsel from  hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by a  
line 32472=>diner's  chair. Only  when they had finished and were preparing to rest, was 
line 32473=>he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share 
line 32474=>in. Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little. 
line 32475=>
line 32476=>####-     'Look here!  ' Sam whispered to Frodo, not too softly: he did not really 
line 32477=>care whether Gollum heard him or  not. `We've got to get some sleep; but not 
line 32478=>both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no  promise. Smjagol 
line 32479=>or Gollum,  he won't change  his habits in a hurry, I'll warrant. You  go to 
line 32480=>sleep, Mr. Frodo, and I'll call you when I can't keep my eyelids propped up. 
line 32481=>Turn and about, same as before, while he's loose.' 
line 32482=>     'Perhaps you're right, Sam,'  said Frodo  speaking openly. 'There is  a 
line 32483=>change  in him, but  just what kind of a change  and  how deep, I'm not sure 
line 32484=>yet.  Seriously though,  I  don't think  there is any  need  for fear --  at 
line 32485=>present.  Still watch if you wish.  Give me about  two hours, not more,  and 
line 32486=>then call me.' 
line 32487=>     So  tired was Frodo that his head  fell forward  on his  breast  and he 
line 32488=>slept. almost as soon as he had spoken the words. Gollum seemed no longer to 
line 32489=>have any fears. He curled  up and  went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. 
line 32490=>Presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched  teeth,  hut he 
line 32491=>lay still as stone.  After a while, fearing that he would  drop off himself, 
line 32492=>if he sat listening  to his two companions breathing, Sam  got up and gently 
line 32493=>prodded  Gollum.  His  hands  uncurled  and  twitched, but he made  no other 
line 32494=>movement.  Sam bent  down and said  fissh close to his ear, but there was  no 
line 32495=>response, not even a catch in Gollum's breathing. 
line 32496=>     Sam scratched his head. `Must really be asleep,' he muttered. `And if I 
line 32497=>was  like Gollum,  he wouldn't  wake up  never  aga in.'  He  restrained  the 
line 32498=>thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat 
line 32499=>down by his master. 
line 32500=>     When he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when 
line 32501=>they had breakfasted. Sam leapt to his feet. Not least from  his own feeling 
line 32502=>of  vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight  
line 32503=>away,  nine hours at least. Frodo was still fast asleep, lying now stretched 
line 32504=>on  his  side. Gollum  was  not to be seen. Various  reproachful  names  for  
line 32505=>himself  came  to  Sam's  mind,  drawn  from  the  Gaffer's  large  paternal 
line 32506=>word-hoard; then  it  also occurred to him that his  master had been  right:  
line 32507=>there  had  for the present been nothing  to guard against. They were at any 
line 32508=>rate both alive and unthrottled. 
line 32509=>     'Poor wretch! ' he said half remorsefully. 'Now I wonder where he's got 
line 32510=>to?  ' 
line 32511=>     'Not far, not far! ' said a  voice  above him. He looked up and saw the 
line 32512=>shape of Gollum's large head and ears against the evening sky. 
line 32513=>
line 32514=>####-     'Here, what are  you doing? ' cried Sam, his suspicions coming back  as 
line 32515=>soon as he saw that shape. 
line 32516=>     `Smjagol is hungry,' said Gollum. `Be back soon.' 
line 32517=>     'Come back now!' shouted Sam. 'Hi! Come back!' But Gollum had vanished. 
line 32518=>     Frodo  woke  at  the sound of Sam's shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. 
line 32519=>'Hullo!' he said. 'Anything wrong? What's the time?' 
line 32520=>     'I dunno,' said Sam. 'After sundown, I  reckon. And he's gone off. Says 
line 32521=>he's hungry.' 
line 32522=>     `Don't worry!'  said Frodo. `There's  no help  for it. But  he'll  come 
line 32523=>back, you'll see. The promise will hold  yet a while. And he won't leave his 
line 32524=>Precious, anyway.' 
line 32525=>     Frodo made  light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for 
line 32526=>hours with Gollum, and a very  hungry Gollum too, loose beside  them. `Don't  
line 32527=>think of any of your  Gaffer's hard names,' he said. 'You were worn out, and 
line 32528=>it has  turned out well: we are now  both rested. And  we  have a hard  road 
line 32529=>ahead, the worst road of all.' 
line 32530=>     `About the  food,' said Sam. 'How long's it going to take us to do this 
line 32531=>job? And  when it's done, what are we  going to do then? This waybread keeps 
line 32532=>you on  your legs in a wonderful way, though  it doesn't satisfy the innards 
line 32533=>proper, as you might say: not to my feeling anyhow, meaning no disrespect to 
line 32534=>them  as made it.  But you have  to eat some of it every day, and it doesn't  
line 32535=>grow. I  reckon we've got  enough to last, say,  three weeks or so, and that 
line 32536=>with a tight belt and a light tooth, mind you. We've been a bit free with it 
line 32537=>so far.' 
line 32538=>     `I  don't know how long we shall take to -- to finish,' said Frodo. `We 
line 32539=>were miserably delayed  in the hills. But Samwise Gamgee,  my dear hobbit  -- 
line 32540=>indeed, Sam my dearest  hobbit, friend of friends  --  I do not think we need 
line 32541=>give thought  to what comes after that. To  do the job as you put it  -- what 
line 32542=>hope is  there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of 
line 32543=>that? If the One goes into the Fire, and we are at hand? I ask you, Sam, are 
line 32544=>we ever likely to need bread again? I think not. If  we can nurse  our limbs 
line 32545=>to bring  us to Mount Doom, that is  all we can do. More than I can, I begin 
line 32546=>to feel.' 
line 32547=>     Sam nodded silently. He took his master's hand and bent over it. He did 
line 32548=>not kiss it,  though his  tears fell on it. Then  he turned away,  drew  his 
line 32549=>sleeve  over his nose, and got up, a nd stamped about, trying to whistle, and 
line 32550=>saying between the efforts: 'Where's that dratted creature?' 
line 32551=>
line 32552=>####-     It was actually not long before Gollum returned; but he came so quietly 
line 32553=>that they did not hear him till  he stood before them. His  fingers and face 
line 32554=>were soiled with black mud. He was still chewing  and slavering. What he was 
line 32555=>chewing, they did not ask or like to think. 
line 32556=>     'Worms  or beetles or something slimy out of holes,' thought Sam. 'Brr! 
line 32557=>The nasty creature; the poor wretch! ' 
line 32558=>     Gollum  said  nothing to  them,  until he had  drunk deeply  and washed 
line 32559=>himself in the  stream. Then he  came up to them, licking  his lips. 'Better 
line 32560=>now,' he said. `Are we  rested? Ready to  go  on? Nice  hobbits,  they sleep 
line 32561=>beautifully. Trust Smjagol now? Very, very good.' 
line 32562=>     The next stage of their journey was much the same as the  last. As they 
line 32563=>went  on the gully became ever shallower and  the slope  of its  floor  more 
line 32564=>gradual. Its  bottom  was less stony and  more earthy, and slowly its  sides 
line 32565=>dwindled to mere ba nks. It began  to wind and wander. That night drew to its 
line 32566=>end, but clouds were now over moon and star, and they  knew of the coming of 
line 32567=>day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light. 
line 32568=>     In  a chill hour they came  to the end of  the water-course. The  banks 
line 32569=>became moss-grown mounds. Over the  last shelf of rotting  stone the  stream 
line 32570=>gurgled  and fell  down into a brown bog and was lost. Dry  reeds hissed and  
line 32571=>rattled though they could feel no wind. 
line 32572=>     On either  side and in front wide  fens and  m ires now lay,  stretching 
line 32573=>away southward and eastward into the dim half-light. Mists curled and smoked 
line 32574=>from dark and noisome pools. The reek of  them hung  stifling  in the  still 
line 32575=>air.  Far away, now almost  due  south, the mountain-walls of Mordor loomed, 
line 32576=>like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea. 
line 32577=>     The hobbits were now wholly in the hands of  Gollum. They did now know,  
line 32578=>and  could not guess in that misty light. that they  were in  fact only just  
line 32579=>within the northern  borders of the marshes. the  main expanse of  which lay 
line 32580=>south of them. They could, if they had known the lands, with some delay have 
line 32581=>retraced their steps  a little, and then turning east have come  round  over  
line 32582=>hard roads  to the bare plain of Dagorlad: the field of  the  ancient battle 
line 32583=>before  the gates of Mordor. Not that there was great hope in such a course. 
line 32584=>On that stony  plain  there was no cover,  and across it ran the highways of 
line 32585=>the Orcs and the soldiers of the Enemy. Not even the cloaks of  Lurien would 
line 32586=>have concealed them there. 
line 32587=>     'How do we shape our course now, Smjagol? ' asked Frodo. 'Must we cross 
line 32588=>these evil-smelling fens?  ' 
line 32589=>
line 32590=>####-     `No need,  no  need at all,' said Gollum. 'Not if hobbits want to reach 
line 32591=>the dark mountains and go to see Him very quick.  Back a little, and round a  
line 32592=>little' -- his skinny arm waved north and  east -- `and you can come on hard 
line 32593=>cold roads to the  very gates of  His country.  Lots  of  His people will be 
line 32594=>there looking out for guests, very pleased to  take them straight  to Him, O 
line 32595=>yes. His Eye watches  that way all the  time. It caught  Smjagol there, long 
line 32596=>ago.' Gollum shuddered. 'But Smjagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes:  
line 32597=>I've used  eyes  and feet  and  nose since then. l  know  other  ways.  More 
line 32598=>difficult, not so quick; but  better, if  we  don't want  Him to see. Follow 
line 32599=>Smjagol! He can take you through  the marshes, through the mists. nice thick 
line 32600=>mists. Follow  Smjagol very carefully, and you  may go  a long  way. quite a  
line 32601=>long way, before He catches you, yes perhaps. ' 
line 32602=>     It was already day, a windless and sullen morning, and the  marsh-reeks 
line 32603=>lay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low  clouded  sky, and Gollum  seemed 
line 32604=>anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a brief  rest they set out 
line 32605=>again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of 
line 32606=>the lands about, either the hills  that they  had left or the mountains that 
line 32607=>they sought. They went slowly in single file: Gollum, Sam, Frodo. 
line 32608=>     Frodo seemed the most weary of the three, and slow though they went. he 
line 32609=>often lagged. The hobbits soon  found that what had looked like one vast fen  
line 32610=>was  really  an  endless  network  of  pools,  and soft  mires. and  winding 
line 32611=>half-strangled water-courses.  Among  these  a cunning eye  and  foot  could 
line 32612=>thread  a wandering path. Gollum  certainly had that cunning, and needed all  
line 32613=>of it. His head on its long  neck  was ever turning this way and that, while 
line 32614=>he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself. Sometimes he would  hold up 
line 32615=>his  hand and halt  them, while he went forward a little, crouching, testing 
line 32616=>the ground with fingers or toes. or merely listening with one ear pressed to 
line 32617=>the earth. 
line 32618=>     It was dreary and wearisome. Cold clammy winter still held sway in this 
line 32619=>forsaken country. The only green was the scum  of  livid weed  on  the  dark  
line 32620=>greasy surfaces of the sullen waters. Dead grasses  and rotting reeds loomed 
line 32621=>up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers.  
line 32622=>     As the day wore on the light increased a little, and the mists  lifted, 
line 32623=>growing thinner and more  transparent. Far above  the rot and vapours of the 
line 32624=>world the Sun was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors 
line 32625=>of dazzling  foam, but  only a  passing  ghost of her could they  see below, 
line 32626=>bleared,  pale, giving  no  colour  and  no  warmth. But even at this  faint 
line 32627=>
line 32628=>####-reminder of  her  presence  Gollum  scowled and  flinched. He  halted  their 
line 32629=>journey,  and they  rested,  squatting  like  little hunted animals, in  the 
line 32630=>borders  of  a  great  brown  reed-thicket. There was  a   deep silence, only 
line 32631=>scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken  
line 32632=>grass-blades trembling in small air -movements that they could not feel. 
line 32633=>     'Not a bird! ' said Sam mournfully. 
line 32634=>     `No, no birds,' said  Gollum.  `Nice birds! ' He licked his  teeth. 'No 
line 32635=>birds  here.  There  are snakeses,  wormses,  things in the  pools. Lots  of 
line 32636=>things,  lots  of nasty things. No birds,' he ended sadly. Sam looked at him 
line 32637=>with distaste. 
line 32638=>     So passed  the  third day  of  their  journey with  Gollum.  Before the 
line 32639=>shadows of evening were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on 
line 32640=>and  on with only brief halts. These  they made not  so much for rest as  to 
line 32641=>help Gollum;  for now  even he had to go forward with great care, and he was 
line 32642=>sometimes at a loss for a while. They had come to the very midst of the Dead 
line 32643=>Marshes, and it was dark. 
line 32644=>     They  walked   slowly,  stooping,  keeping  close  in  line,  following 
line 32645=>attentively  every move that  Gollum made.  The fens grew more  wet, opening 
line 32646=>into  wide stagnant meres, among which it grew  more and more  difficult  to 
line 32647=>find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking  into gurgling 
line 32648=>mud. The travellers were  light, or maybe none of them would ever have found 
line 32649=>a way through. 
line 32650=>     Presently it  grew  altogether  dark: the air  itself seemed  black and 
line 32651=>heavy to breathe. When lights appeared Sam  rubbed his eyes: he  thought his 
line 32652=>head was going  queer. He first  saw one with the corner of his  left eye, a  
line 32653=>wisp  of pale sheen that faded away;  but  others appeared soon  after: some 
line 32654=>like dimly shining smoke,  some  like  misty flames flickering  slowly above 
line 32655=>unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets  unfurled by 
line 32656=>hidden hands. But neither of his companions spoke a word. 
line 32657=>     At  last  Sam could bear it  no longer. `What's all this, Gollum? '  he 
line 32658=>said in a whisper. `These lights? They're all  round us now. Are we trapped?  
line 32659=>Who are they? ' 
line 32660=>     Gollum looked up. A  dark water was before him, and he was crawling  on 
line 32661=>the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. 'Yes, they are all round 
line 32662=>us,' he whispered. 'The tricksy lights. Candles  of corpses, yes, yes. Don't 
line 32663=>you heed them! Don't look! Don't follow them! Where's the master? ' 
line 32664=>     Sam looked back and found that Frodo had lagged again. He could not see 
line 32665=>
line 32666=>####-him. He went some paces back into the darkness,  not daring to move far,  or  
line 32667=>to call in more than a  hoarse  whisper. Suddenly he stumbled against Frodo, 
line 32668=>who was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. His hands hung 
line 32669=>stiff at his sides; water and slime were dripping from them. 
line 32670=>     `Come,  Mr. Frodo!  ' said Sam.  'Don't look at  them!  Gollum says  we 
line 32671=>mustn't. Let's keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as 
line 32672=>we can -- if we can!  ' 
line 32673=>     `All right,' said Frodo,  as if returning out of a dream.  'I'm coming. 
line 32674=>Go on!  ' 
line 32675=>     Hurrying forward again, Sam tripped, catching his foot in some old root 
line 32676=>or  tussock.  He fell  and came heavily on  his hands, which  sank deep into 
line 32677=>sticky ooze,  so that his  fa ce was brought close to the surface of the dark 
line 32678=>mere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the  lights flickered 
line 32679=>and danced and swirled.  For a moment the water  below him  looked like some 
line 32680=>window, glazed with grimy glass, through which he was  peering. Wrenching 
line 32681=>his 
line 32682=>hands out  of the  bog, he sprang  back  with a cry. 'There are dead things,  
line 32683=>dead faces in the water,' he said with horror. 'Dead faces! ' 
line 32684=>     Gollum laughed. 'The Dead Marshes,  yes, yes: that is their names,'  he 
line 32685=>cackled. `You should not look in when the candles are lit.' 
line 32686=>     `Who are they? What are they? ' asked Sam shuddering, turning to Frodo, 
line 32687=>who was now behind him. 
line 32688=>     'I don't know,' said Frodo in a dreamlike voice. 'But I have seen  them 
line 32689=>too. In the pools when the candles were lit. They lie in all the pools, pale 
line 32690=>faces, deep deep under the dark water. I saw  them: grim faces and evil, and 
line 32691=>noble faces and sad. Many faces  proud and fair, and weeds  in their  silver  
line 32692=>hair.  But all foul, all rotting, all  dead. A fell light is in them.' Frodo 
line 32693=>hid  his eyes in his hands.  'I  know not who they are; but I thought I  saw 
line 32694=>there Men and Elves, and Orcs beside them.' 
line 32695=>     `Yes, yes,' said Gollum. `All dead, all rotten. Elves and Men and Orcs.  
line 32696=>The  Dead  Marshes. There was a great battle long ago, yes, so they told him 
line 32697=>when Smjagol was young, when I was young  before the Precious came. It was 
line 32698=>a 
line 32699=>great  battle. Tall  Men with long swords, and terrible  Elves,  and  Orcses 
line 32700=>shrieking. They fought on  the plain for days and months at the Black Gates.  
line 32701=>But  the  Marshes have grown since  then,  swallowed up the  graves;  always 
line 32702=>creeping, creeping.' 
line 32703=>
line 32704=>####-     'But that is an age and more ago,'  said Sam. 'The Dead can't be really 
line 32705=>there! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land? ' 
line 32706=>     `Who knows?  Smjagol doesn't  know,'  answered Gollum. 'You cannot reach 
line 32707=>them,  you  cannot touch them. We tried once, .yes,  precious. I tried once; 
line 32708=>but you cannot reach them. Only  shapes  to see, perhaps, not  to  touch. No 
line 32709=>precious! All dead.' 
line 32710=>     Sam  looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed 
line 32711=>why Smjagol  had tried to touch them. `Well, I don't  want to  see them,' he 
line 32712=>said. 'Never again! Can't we get on and get away? ' 
line 32713=>     `Yes,  yes,' said  Gollum. `But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully! Or 
line 32714=>hobbits go  down to  join the Dead  ones  and light  little  candles. Follow 
line 32715=>Smjagol! Don't look at lights! ' 
line 32716=>     He  crawled away to the  right, seeking for a path round the mere. They  
line 32717=>came close behind, stooping, often using their hands even as he  did. 'Three 
line 32718=>precious  little Gollums in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,' 
line 32719=>thought Sam. 
line 32720=>     At last they came to the  end of the black  mere, and  they crossed it, 
line 32721=>perilously,  crawling  or hopping  from  one  treacherous island tussock  to 
line 32722=>another. Often they floundered, stepping or  falling hands-first into waters 
line 32723=>as  noisome as a cesspool,  till  they were slimed and  fouled almost  up to 
line 32724=>their necks and stank in one another's nostrils. 
line 32725=>     It was late  in the night  when at  length  they reached  firmer ground 
line 32726=>again.  Gollum hissed  and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was 
line 32727=>pleased: in some mysterious way,  by some blended  sense of feel, and smell, 
line 32728=>and uncanny memory for shapes  in  the dark, he seemed to know just where he 
line 32729=>was again, and to be sure of his road ahead. 
line 32730=>     `Now on we  go!  ' he  said.  'Nice  hobbits! Brave  hobbits! Very very 
line 32731=>weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take master  
line 32732=>away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.' With these words he started 
line 32733=>off again, almost  at a trot,  down what  appeared to be a long lane between 
line 32734=>high reeds, and they  stumbled after him  as quickly as they could. But in a  
line 32735=>little while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the  air doubtfully, hissing as 
line 32736=>if he was troubled or displeased again. 
line 32737=>     'What is it? ' growled Sam, misinterpreting the signs. `What's the need 
line 32738=>to  sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and 
line 32739=>master stinks; the whole place stinks.' 
line 32740=>     'Yes, yes, and Sam stinks! ' answered Gollum. `Poor Smjagol  smells it, 
line 32741=>
line 32742=>####-but good  Smjagol bears  it. Helps nice master. But  that's no  matter.  The 
line 32743=>air's moving, change is coming. Smjagol wonders; he's not happy.' 
line 32744=>     He went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and  every  now and again he 
line 32745=>stood  up to his full height, craning his neck eastward and  southward.  For 
line 32746=>some  time the hobbits could not  hear  or feel what was troubling him. Then 
line 32747=>suddenly all  three  halted, stiffening and listening. To Frodo  and  Sam it 
line 32748=>seemed that  they  heard, far away, a  long  wailing cry, high and  thin and 
line 32749=>cruel.  They shivered. At  the same  moment the stirring  of the  air became 
line 32750=>perceptible to them; and it grew  very cold. As they  stood  straining their 
line 32751=>ears,  they heard a noise  like a  wind coming  in  the distance.  The misty 
line 32752=>lights wavered, dimmed, and went out. 
line 32753=>     Gollum would not move. He stood shaking and gibbering to himself, until 
line 32754=>with a rush the wind came upon  them, hissing and snarling over the marshes.  
line 32755=>The  night became less  dark,  light enough  for them to  see, or  half see, 
line 32756=>shapeless drifts of fog,  curling and  twisting  as it rolled over them  and 
line 32757=>passed them. Looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then 
line 32758=>high in the south the moon glimmered out, riding in the flying wrack. 
line 32759=>     For a moment the sight of  it  gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but 
line 32760=>Gollum cowered down, muttering curses on the White Face. Then Frodo and  
line 32761=>Sam 
line 32762=>staring at  the sky, breathing deeply of the  fresher  air, saw  it come:  a  
line 32763=>small  cloud  flying from the  accursed hills; a  black  shadow loosed  from 
line 32764=>Mordor;  a vast shape winged and ominous. It  scudded  across the  moon, and 
line 32765=>with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed. 
line 32766=>     They fell  forward, grovelling  heedlessly on the cold earth.  But  the 
line 32767=>shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing  lower now, right above them, 
line 32768=>sweeping the  fen-reek with its ghastly wings. And then  it was gone, flying 
line 32769=>back to Mordor with the speed of the wrath of Sauron; and behind it the wind 
line 32770=>roared away, leaving the  Dead Marshes bare and bleak. The naked  waste,  as 
line 32771=>far  as the eye could pierce, even to the  distant  menace of the mountains,  
line 32772=>was dappled with the fitful moonlight. 
line 32773=>     Frodo and Sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an 
line 32774=>evil dream to find the familiar  night still over the world. But Gollum  lay 
line 32775=>on the ground as if  he had been stunned. They  roused him  with difficulty, 
line 32776=>and for some time  he  would not  lift  his  face, but knelt forward on  his 
line 32777=>elbows, covering the back of his head with his large flat hands.  
line 32778=>     `Wraiths!'  he wailed. `Wraiths on wings! The Precious is their master. 
line 32779=>
line 32780=>####-They see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from them. Curse the White 
line 32781=>Face! And they tell  H im everything. He sees, He knows. Ach, gollum, gollum, 
line 32782=>gollum!  '  It was not until  the moon had  sunk, westering  far  beyond Tol 
line 32783=>Brandir, that he would get up or make a move. 
line 32784=>     From that time on Sam thought that he  sensed a change in Gollum again.  
line 32785=>He was more  fawning and would-be  friendly; but Sam  surprised some strange 
line 32786=>looks  in his eyes at times, especially towards Frodo; and he went back more 
line 32787=>and  more  into his  old  manner  of  speaking. And Sam  had another growing 
line 32788=>anxiety. Frodo seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said 
line 32789=>nothing.  indeed he  hardly  spoke  at all; and  he did not complain, but he 
line 32790=>walked like one who carries a load, the  weight of which is ever increasing; 
line 32791=>and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that Sam had often to beg Gollum 
line 32792=>to wait and not to leave their master behind. 
line 32793=>     In fact with every step towards the gates of Mordor Frodo felt the Ring 
line 32794=>on  its chain about his neck grow  more burdensome.  He was now beginning to 
line 32795=>feel  it as an actual  weight  dragging him earthwards.  But far more he was 
line 32796=>troubled by the Eye: so he called it to  himself. It was that more  than the 
line 32797=>drag of the Ring that made him cower  and stoop as he walked. The Eye:  that 
line 32798=>horrible  growing sense of a  hostile will  that  strove with great power to 
line 32799=>pierce all shadows of  cloud, and earth, and  flesh, and to see you: to  pin 
line 32800=>you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the 
line 32801=>veils  were become  that still warded  it  off. Frodo  knew just  where  the 
line 32802=>present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can 
line 32803=>tell the  direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its 
line 32804=>potency beat upon his brow.  
line 32805=>     Gollum probably felt something of the same sort.  But  what went  on in 
line 32806=>his wretched heart between the pressure of the Eye, and the lust of the Ring 
line 32807=>that was so near, and his grovelling  promise made half in the fear of  cold 
line 32808=>iron, the hobbits did not guess: Frodo gave no thought to it. Sam's mind was 
line 32809=>occupied  mostly  with his  master hardly  noticing the  dark cloud that had 
line 32810=>fallen on his own  heart. He put Frodo  in front  of  him  now, and  kept  a  
line 32811=>watchful eye on every movement of  his,  supporting him if  he stumbled, and 
line 32812=>trying to encourage him with clumsy words.  
line 32813=>     When day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer 
line 32814=>the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder, 
line 32815=>and though still far off, the walls of Mordor were no longer a cloudy menace 
line 32816=>on the edge of sight, but as  gr im black towers they frowned across a dismal 
line 32817=>
line 32818=>####-waste. The marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats 
line 32819=>of  dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow  slopes, barren and 
line 32820=>pitiless, towards the desert that lay at Sauron's gate. 
line 32821=>     While the  grey light lasted,  they cowered under a  black  stone  like 
line 32822=>worms,  shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass  and spy them with its 
line 32823=>cruel eyes. The  remainder of that journey  was a shadow of growing  fear in  
line 32824=>which  memory could  find   nothing  to  rest upon.  For two more nights they 
line 32825=>struggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them, 
line 32826=>grew harsh, and filled  with  a  bitter  reek that caught their  breath  and 
line 32827=>parched their mouths.  
line 32828=>     At last,  on the  fifth morning since  they took the road  with Gollum, 
line 32829=>they halted once  more. Before  them  dark in  the dawn the great  mountains 
line 32830=>reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from  their feet were flung huge 
line 32831=>buttresses  and  broken hills  that were now at the nearest  scarce a  dozen 
line 32832=>miles away. Frodo looked round  in horror. Dreadful as the Dead  Marshes had 
line 32833=>been, and  the  arid moors  of the  Noman-lands, more loathsome  far was the 
line 32834=>country that the  crawling day now  slowly  unveiled  to his shrinking eyes.  
line 32835=>Even to the  Mere  of Dead Faces some haggard phantom of  green spring 
line 32836=>would 
line 32837=>come; but here neither spring nor summer would ever come again. Here 
line 32838=>nothing 
line 32839=>lived,  not  even the  leprous growths that feed on rottenness. The  gasping 
line 32840=>pools were choked  with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as  if 
line 32841=>the mountains had vomited the filth of  their entrails upon the lands about. 
line 32842=>High  mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great cones of earth fire-blasted 
line 32843=>and  poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly  
line 32844=>revealed in the reluctant light. 
line 32845=>     They  had come to  the desolation that lay  before Mordor:  the lasting 
line 32846=>monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should  endure when all their 
line 32847=>purposes were  made  void; a  land defiled,  diseased beyond  all healing -- 
line 32848=>unless the Great  Sea should enter in and  wash  it with oblivion.  `I  feel 
line 32849=>sick,' said Sam. Frodo did not speak. 
line 32850=>     For a while  they stood there, like men on the edge  of a  sleep  where 
line 32851=>nightmare lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to 
line 32852=>morning  through the  shadows. The light broadened and hardened. The 
line 32853=>gasping 
line 32854=>pits and  poisonous mounds grew hideously clear.  The  sun  was up,  walking 
line 32855=>
line 32856=>####-among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. The 
line 32857=>hobbits had no welcome for that light; unfriendly  it seemed, revealing them 
line 32858=>in their helplessness  --  little squeaking ghosts that  wandered among  the 
line 32859=>ash-heaps of the Dark Lord. 
line 32860=>     Too weary  to go  further  they sought for some place where they  could 
line 32861=>rest. For a while  they sat without speaking  under the shadow of a mound of 
line 32862=>slag; but foul fumes  leaked out of it, catching their  throats and  choking 
line 32863=>them. Gollum was the first to get up. Spluttering  and  cursing he rose, and 
line 32864=>without  a  word or  a glance at the hobbits  he crawled  away on all fours.  
line 32865=>Frodo and Sam crawled  after him, until  they came to a wide almost circular 
line 32866=>pit, high-banked upon the west. It was  cold and dead, and  a foul  sump  of 
line 32867=>oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bottom.  In  this evil hole they cowered, 
line 32868=>hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the Eye. 
line 32869=>     The  day passed  slowly. A  great thirst troubled  them, but they drank  
line 32870=>only a few  drops from their bottles-last filled in  the gully, which now as 
line 32871=>they looked back in thought seemed to  them a place of peace and beauty. The 
line 32872=>hobbits  took it in turn to watch. At first, tired as they  were, neither of 
line 32873=>them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow 
line 32874=>moving cloud, Sam dozed. It was Frodo's turn to bc on  guard. He lay back on 
line 32875=>the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense  of burden that was on 
line 32876=>him. He looked  up at the  smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phantoms, dark 
line 32877=>riding shapes, and  faces  out of the past. He  lost count of time, hovering 
line 32878=>between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him. 
line 32879=>     Suddenly Sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling.  It was 
line 32880=>evening. Frodo could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid 
line 32881=>down nearly to the  bottom of  the pit. Gollum was by  him. For a moment Sam 
line 32882=>thought that he was trying to  rouse Frodo; then he saw that it was  not so. 
line 32883=>Gollum was talking to himself. Smjagol was holding a  debate with some other 
line 32884=>thought  that used the same voice but  made it squeak and hiss. A pale light 
line 32885=>and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke. 
line 32886=>     `Smjagol promised,' said the first thought. 
line 32887=>     `Yes,  yes, my precious,' came  the  answer, 'we promised: to  save our 
line 32888=>Precious, not to let Him have it -- never. But it's going to Him yes, nearer  
line 32889=>every step.  What's the hobbit going  to  do  with it,  we wonders,  yes  we 
line 32890=>wonders.' 
line 32891=>     `I don't know. I can't help it. Master's  got it. Smjagol  promised  to 
line 32892=>help the master.' 
line 32893=>
line 32894=>####-     `Yes,  yes, to  help the master: the  master of the Precious. But if we 
line 32895=>was master, then we could help ourselfs, yes, and still keep promises.' 
line 32896=>     `But Smjagol said  he  would be very  very good.  Nice  hobbit! He took  
line 32897=>cruel rope off Smjagol's leg. He speaks nicely to me.' 
line 32898=>     'Very very good, eh, my precious? Let's be  good,  good as fish,  sweet  
line 32899=>one, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.' 
line 32900=>     `But the Precious holds the promise,' the voice of Smjagol objected. 
line 32901=>     `Then take it,' said  the other,  `and let's hold it ourselfs!  Then we 
line 32902=>shall be master, gollum! Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit, 
line 32903=>make him crawl, yes, gollum!' 
line 32904=>     `But not the nice hobbit? ' 
line 32905=>     `Oh no, not if it doesn't please us. Still he's a Baggins, my precious,  
line 32906=>yes,  a  Baggins.  A  Baggins  stole it. He  found it  and  he said nothing, 
line 32907=>nothing. We hates Bagginses.' 
line 32908=>     'No, not this Baggins.' 
line 32909=>     'Yes, every Baggins. All peoples  that  keep the Precious. We must have 
line 32910=>it!  ' 
line 32911=>     `But He'll see, He'll know. He'll take it from us! ' 
line 32912=>     'He sees.  He knows.  He  heard us make silly  promises   -- against His 
line 32913=>orders, yes. Must take it. The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.' 
line 32914=>     'Not for Him! ' 
line 32915=>     'No, sweet  one. See, my precious: if  we  has it, then we  can escape, 
line 32916=>even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord 
line 32917=>Smjagol? Gollum  the Great?  The Gollum! Eat fish every day,  three times  a 
line 32918=>day; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we 
line 32919=>wants it, we wants it!  ' 
line 32920=>     'But there's two of them. They'll wake too quick and kill  us,'  whined 
line 32921=>Smjagol in a last effort. `Not now. Not yet.' 
line 32922=>     'We  wants  it! But'  -- and here there  was a  long  pause, as if a new 
line 32923=>thought had wakened.  `Not yet,  eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might, 
line 32924=>yes.' 
line 32925=>     `No, no! Not that way! ' wailed Smjagol. 
line 32926=>     `Yes! We wants it! We wants it! ' 
line 32927=>     Each time that  the second thought spoke, Gollum's  long hand crept out 
line 32928=>slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as 
line 32929=>Smjagol 
line 32930=>spoke  again. Finally  both  arms,  with long fingers  flexed and twitching, 
line 32931=>
line 32932=>####-clawed towards his neck. 
line 32933=>     Sam had lain  still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move 
line 32934=>that Gollum made  from under  his half-closed eye-lids.  To  his simple mind 
line 32935=>ordinary  hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief  danger in 
line 32936=>Gollum. He realized  now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible 
line 32937=>call  of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who 
line 32938=>She 
line 32939=>was. One of  the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings, 
line 32940=>he supposed.  Then he  forgot the  point, for things had  plainly  gone  far 
line 32941=>enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness  was in all his limbs,  
line 32942=>but he roused  himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be 
line 32943=>careful  and  not to reveal that he had overheard  the debate. He let  out a  
line 32944=>loud sigh and gave a huge yawn. 
line 32945=>     `What's the time? ' he said sleepily. 
line 32946=>     Gollum sent  out a  long  hiss  through his  teeth. He stood  up  for a  
line 32947=>moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all 
line 32948=>fours and  crawling  up the bank  of the pit. 'Nice hobbits! Nice Sam! '  he 
line 32949=>said. 'Sleepy heads,  yes, sleepy  heads! Leave good  Smjagol to watch!  But 
line 32950=>it's evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.' 
line 32951=>     `High time!  ' thought Sam. 'And time we parted,  too.' Yet it  crossed 
line 32952=>his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as 
line 32953=>kept with them. 'Curse him! I wish he was choked!' he muttered.  He stumbled 
line 32954=>down the bank and roused his master. 
line 32955=>     Strangely enough, Frodo felt  refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark  
line 32956=>shadow  had  passed,  and  a  fair  vision  had visited him in  this land of 
line 32957=>disease. Nothing remained  of it in his  memory, yet  because of it he  felt 
line 32958=>glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed 
line 32959=>him  with  dog-like delight. He  chuckled and  chattered,  cracking his long 
line 32960=>fingers, and pawing at Frodo's knees. Frodo smiled at him. 
line 32961=>     'Come! ' he said. `You  have guided us well and faithfully. This is the 
line 32962=>last stage. Bring us to the Gate, and then I will not ask you to go further. 
line 32963=>Bring us to  the Gate,  and you  may  go where you wish  --  only not to our 
line 32964=>enemies.' 
line 32965=>     'To  the Gate, eh?' Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised  and frightened. 
line 32966=>'To the Gate, master  says! Yes, he says so.  And  good Smjagol does what he 
line 32967=>asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we'll  see perhaps we'll  see then. It 
line 32968=>won't look nice at all. O no! O no!' 
line 32969=>
line 32970=>####-     'Go on with you! ' said Sam. `Let's get it over! ' 
line 32971=>     In the falling dusk they  scrambled out of the pit and slowly  threaded 
line 32972=>their way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once 
line 32973=>more the fear that had fallen on them  when  the winged shape swept over the 
line 32974=>marshes.  They  halted, cowering  on the evil -smelling ground; but  they saw 
line 32975=>nothing  in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the  menace  passed, high 
line 32976=>overhead, going maybe  on some swift errand  from Barad-dyr.  After  a while 
line 32977=>Gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking. 
line 32978=>     About an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it 
line 32979=>now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds,  rushing 
line 32980=>with terrible  speed  into  the  West.  Gollum,  however,  was helpless with 
line 32981=>terror, and was convinced that they were  being hunted, that  their approach 
line 32982=>was known. 
line 32983=>     `Three times! ' he  whimpered.  'Three times is  a threat. They feel us 
line 32984=>here, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any  
line 32985=>further this way, no. It's no use, no use! ' 
line 32986=>     Pleading and  kind words were no longer of any  avail. It was not until 
line 32987=>Frodo commanded him angrily and  laid a hand on  his sword-hilt  that Gollum 
line 32988=>would get up again. Then at last he rose with  a snarl, and went before them 
line 32989=>like a beaten dog. 
line 32990=>     So they stumbled on through  the weary end  of the night, and until the 
line 32991=>coming  of another  day of  fear they walked  in silence with  bowed  heads,  
line 32992=>seeing nothing, and hearing nothing but the wind hissing in their ears. 
line 32993=> 
line 32994=>
line 32995=>####- 
line 32996=>
line 32997=>Chapter 3. The Black Gate is Closed 
line 32998=>
line 32999=> 
line 33000=> 
line 33001=>     Before  the  next day dawned  their journey to  Mordor  was  over.  The 
line 33002=>marshes and the desert  were  behind them. Before  them, darkling  against a  
line 33003=>pallid sky, the great mountains reared their threatening heads.  
line 33004=>     Upon the west of  Mordor marched the gloomy range  of  Ephel D®ath, the 
line 33005=>Mountains of Shadow, and upon the north  the broken peaks and barren  ridges 
line 33006=>of  Ered  Lithui, grey as ash. But as these ranges  approached one  another, 
line 33007=>being indeed  but  parts  of  one  great  wall about  the mournful plains of 
line 33008=>Lithlad and of Gorgoroth, and the bitter inland sea of N®rnen amidmost, they 
line 33009=>swung out  long arms northward;  and between  these arms  there  was a  deep 
line 33010=>defile.  This was Cirith Gorgor,  the Haunted Pass, the entrance to the land 
line 33011=>of the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward  from 
line 33012=>its mouth were two  sheer  hills, black -boned and bare. Upon  them stood the 
line 33013=>Teeth  of  Mordor, two towers strong and  tall. In days long past they  were 
line 33014=>built by the Men of Gondor in their pride and power,  after the overthrow of 
line 33015=>Sauron and his flight, lest he  should seek to return to his old realm.  But 
line 33016=>the strength of Gondor  failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers 
line 33017=>stood  empty.  Then Sauron returned. Now  the watch-towers, which  had fallen 
line 33018=>into  decay,  were  repaired, and  filled  with arms,  and  garrisoned  with 
line 33019=>ceaseless vigilance. Stony-faced they were, with  dark  window-holes staring 
line 33020=>north and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes. 
line 33021=>     Across the  mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff,  the Dark Lord  had 
line 33022=>built a rampart of stone. In it  there  was a single gate of  iron, and upon 
line 33023=>its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the hills on either side 
line 33024=>the  rock  was bored into  a hundred caves and maggot -holes: there a host of 
line 33025=>orcs lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to  war. 
line 33026=>None could pass the  Teeth of  Mordor and not feel  their bite, unless  they 
line 33027=>were summoned by Sauron, or knew the  secret  passwords  that would open 
line 33028=>the 
line 33029=>Morannon, the black gate of his land. 
line 33030=>     The two hobbits  gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even from 
line 33031=>a distance they could see  in the dim light the movement of the black guards 
line 33032=>upon the wall,  and  the patrols before the gate. They lay now peering  over  
line 33033=>the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of the northmost  
line 33034=>
line 33035=>####-buttress of Ephel D®ath. Winging  the heavy air in a straight flight a crow, 
line 33036=>maybe, would have flown  but a furlong from  their hiding-place to the  black 
line 33037=>summit  of  the  nearer  tower. A faint smoke curled  above it, as  if  fire 
line 33038=>smouldered in the hill beneath. 
line 33039=>     Day  came, and the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless  ridges of Ered 
line 33040=>Lithui.  Then su ddenly the cry of brazen-throated  trumpets was  heard: from 
line 33041=>the watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in 
line 33042=>the  hills  came  answering calls; and  further  still, remote but  deep and 
line 33043=>ominous, there echoed in  the hollow land  beyond the mighty horns  and drums 
line 33044=>of Barad-dyr. Another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to Mordor;  and 
line 33045=>the night-guards were  summoned to their dungeons and  deep  halls, and  the 
line 33046=>day-guards, evil-eyed and fell,  were marching to their posts. Steel gleamed 
line 33047=>dimly on the battlement. 
line 33048=>     `Well, here we are! ' said Sam. `Here's the Gate, and it looks to me as 
line 33049=>if that's about as far as we are ever going  to get. My word, but the Gaffer  
line 33050=>would have a thing or two to say, if he saw me now! Often said I'd come to a 
line 33051=>bad  end, if I didn't watch my step, he  did. But  now I don't suppose  I'll 
line 33052=>ever see  the  old fellow again. He'll miss his chance of  I told'ee so, Sam: 
line 33053=>more's the  pity. He could go on telling me as  long as he'd got breath,  if 
line 33054=>only I could see his old face again. But I'd have to get a wash first, or he 
line 33055=>wouldn't know me. 
line 33056=>     `I suppose it's no good asking "what way do we go now?" We  can't go no 
line 33057=>further -unless we want to ask the orcs for a lift.' 
line 33058=>     `No, no! ' said Gollum. `No use. We can't  go further. Smjagol  said so. 
line 33059=>He said: we'll go to the Gate, and then we'll see. And we do see. O yes.  my 
line 33060=>precious, we do see. Smjagol  knew  hobbits  could  not  go this way. O yes.  
line 33061=>Smjagol knew ' 
line 33062=>     'Then  what the plague  did you  bring  us here  for? '  said  Sam, not 
line 33063=>feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable. 
line 33064=>     `Master said so. Master says:  Bring  us to the  Gate. So  good Smjagol 
line 33065=>does so. Master said so, wise master.' 
line 33066=>     'I did,' said  Frodo. His face  was grim  and set. but resolute. He was 
line 33067=>filthy, haggard, and pinched with weariness,  but he cowered  no longer, and 
line 33068=>his eyes were clear. `I  said so, because  I purpose  to enter Mordor, and I 
line 33069=>know no other way. Therefore I shall go this  way. I do not ask anyone to go 
line 33070=>with me.' 
line 33071=>     `No, no,  master! ' wailed  Gollum; pawing at him, and seeming in great 
line 33072=>
line 33073=>####-distress.  `No use  that way! No use! Don't take  the Precious to Him! He'll 
line 33074=>eat us all,  if He gets it,  eat all the world. Keep it, nice master, and be 
line 33075=>kind to Smjagol. Don't let  Him have  it. Or go away.  go to nice places, and 
line 33076=>give it back to little Smjagol. Yes, yes, master: give  it back, eh? Smjagol 
line 33077=>will  keep it  safe;  he will do  lots of good, especially to nice  hobbits.  
line 33078=>Hobbits go home. Don't go to the Gate! ' 
line 33079=>     'I am commanded  to go to the land of Mordor, and therefore I shall go,' 
line 33080=>said Frodo. 'If there is only one way, then I must take it. What comes after  
line 33081=>must come.' 
line 33082=>     Sam said nothing.  The look on Frodo's face was enough for him  he knew 
line 33083=>that words of his were useless. And after all he never had any real hope  in 
line 33084=>the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed 
line 33085=>hope, as  long as  despair could  be  postponed. Now they  were come to  the 
line 33086=>bitter end. But he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had 
line 33087=>chiefly come  for, and he would  still stick to him. His master would not go 
line 33088=>to Mordor alone. Sam would go with him-and at any rate they would get rid of 
line 33089=>Gollum. 
line 33090=>     Gollum, however, did not  intend to  be  got rid  of, yet. He knelt  a t 
line 33091=>Frodo's feet, wringing his hands and  squeaking. 'Not this way, master! ' he 
line 33092=>pleaded, 'There is another way. O  yes indeed there is. Another way. darker, 
line 33093=>more difficult to find, more secret. But  Smjagol knows it. Let Smjagol show 
line 33094=>you!  ' 
line 33095=>     'Another wa y!  ' said Frodo  doubtfully, looking down  at  Gollum  with 
line 33096=>searching eyes. 
line 33097=>     'Yess! Yess indeed! There was another  way. Smjagol found it. Let's  go 
line 33098=>and see if it's still there! ' 
line 33099=>     `You have not spoken of this before.' 
line 33100=>     `No.  Master did not ask.  Master did not say what he  meant  to do. He 
line 33101=>does not  tell poor  Smjagol. He says: Smjagol, take me to  the Gate  -- and 
line 33102=>then good bye! Smjagol can run away and  be good. But now he says: I purpose 
line 33103=>to enter Mordor this way.  So  Smjagol is very  afraid. He does not  want to 
line 33104=>lose  nice  master.  And he promised, master made  him promise,  to save the 
line 33105=>Precious. But master is going to take it to Him, straight to the Black Hand, 
line 33106=>if master will go this way. So Smjagol must save them both, and he thinks of 
line 33107=>another  way  that there was, once upon a  time.  Nice  master. Smjagol very 
line 33108=>good, always helps.' 
line 33109=>     Sam frowned. If he could have  bored holes in Gollum  with his eyes, he 
line 33110=>
line 33111=>####-would have done. His  mind was full of doubt.  To all appearances Gollum was 
line 33112=>genuinely  distressed  and anxious to  help Frodo. But  Sam, remembering the 
line 33113=>overheard debate, found it hard  to believe that the long submerged  Smjagol  
line 33114=>had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the 
line 33115=>debate. Sam's  guess was that  the Smjagol and Gollum halves (or what in his 
line 33116=>own mind he called Slinker  and Stinker) had made  a  truce and a  temporary 
line 33117=>alliance: neither  wanted  the Enemy to get the Ring;  both  wished to  keep 
line 33118=>Frodo from capture, and under their  eye, as long as possible -- at any rate 
line 33119=>as long as Stinker still had  a  chance  of laying hands  on his 'Precious'. 
line 33120=>Whether there really was another way into Mordor Sam doubted. 
line 33121=>     `And it's a good thing neither half  of the old villain don't know what 
line 33122=>master means to do ,' he thought. `If he knew that Mr. Frodo is trying to put 
line 33123=>an end  to his Precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, I 
line 33124=>bet.  Anyhow old Stinker  is so frightened  of the Enemy  --  and  he's under 
line 33125=>orders  of some kind from him, or was  -- that he'd give us away rather than 
line 33126=>be caught helping us; and rather than let his  Precious be melted, maybe. At 
line 33127=>least  that's my idea. And I hope  the master will  think it  out carefully. 
line 33128=>He's  as wise as any,  but he's soft -hearted, that's what he is. It's beyond 
line 33129=>any Gamgee to guess what he'll do next.' 
line 33130=>     Frodo did not answer  Gollum at once.  While these  doubts were passing 
line 33131=>through Sam's slow  but  shrewd  mind, he  stood gazing out towards the dark 
line 33132=>cliff of Cirith Gorgor. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved 
line 33133=>in the side of a  low  hill, at some  little height above  a long trenchlike 
line 33134=>valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. In the  
line 33135=>midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western  watch-tower.  
line 33136=>By morning-light the roads that converged upon the  Gate of Mordor could 
line 33137=>now 
line 33138=>be clearly  seen,  pale  and  dusty; one  winding  back  northwards; another  
line 33139=>dwindling eastwards into the mists that clung about the feet of Ered Lithui; 
line 33140=>and  a  third that ran towards him. As  it bent sharply round  the tower, it 
line 33141=>entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where  he stood. 
line 33142=>Westward, to his  right, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains,  
line 33143=>and  went off southwards into  the deep shadows that mantled all the western 
line 33144=>sides of Ephel D®ath; beyond his sight it journeyed on  into the narrow land 
line 33145=>between the mountains and the Great River. 
line 33146=>     As he gazed Frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement 
line 33147=>on the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the march, though for the 
line 33148=>
line 33149=>####-most part they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and 
line 33150=>wastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets;  
line 33151=>and over the levels beside  the roads horsemen could be seen  riding in many  
line 33152=>companies.  He  remembered his  vision from afar upon Amon Hen,  so few 
line 33153=>days 
line 33154=>before, though now it seemed many years ago. Then he knew that the hope that 
line 33155=>had for one wild  moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not  
line 33156=>rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark Lord by 
line 33157=>the men of Gondor, risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long 
line 33158=>passed away. These were Men  of  other  race, out  of  the  wide  Eastlands, 
line 33159=>gathering  to the summons of their Overlord; armies that had encamped before 
line 33160=>his  Gate by  night  and  now marched in to swell  his mounting power. As if 
line 33161=>suddenly made fully  aware of the  peril  of their  position, alone,  in the 
line 33162=>growing light of day, so near  to this  vast menace, Frodo quickly drew  his 
line 33163=>frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the dell. Then he 
line 33164=>turned to Gollum. 
line 33165=>     `Smjagol,' he said, `I will trust you once more. lndeed it seems that I 
line 33166=>must do so,  and that it is my fate to receive help from you. where  I least  
line 33167=>looked  for  it, and  your  fate to help me whom you long  pursued with evil 
line 33168=>purpose.  So far  you have deserved well  of me  and have kept your  promise 
line 33169=>truly. Truly, I say and mean,' he added with a glance at Sam, 'for twice now 
line 33170=>we have been in your  power, and  you have  done no harm to us. Nor have you  
line 33171=>tried to take  from  me what you once sought.  May the third time  prove the 
line 33172=>best! But I warn you, Smjagol, you are in danger.' 
line 33173=>     `Yes, yes,  master!  '  said Gollum. `Dreadful  danger! Smjagol's bones 
line 33174=>shake to think of it. but he doesn't run away. He must help nice master.' 
line 33175=>     'I  did not mean  the danger that we all  share,' said Frodo. 'I mean a  
line 33176=>danger to yourself alone. You swore a promise by what you call the Precious.  
line 33177=>Remember tha t! It will hold you to it; but it will seek a way to twist it to 
line 33178=>your own undoing. Already you are being twisted. You revealed yourself to me 
line 33179=>just  now, foolishly.  Give it back  to  Smjagol you  said. Do  not say that 
line 33180=>again! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will  never get it back. But 
line 33181=>the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back. 
line 33182=>In  the last need, Smjagol, I should put  on the Precious; and the  Precious 
line 33183=>mastered you  long ago. If  I,  wearing  it, were to  command you, you would 
line 33184=>obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice  or to cast yourself into the 
line 33185=>fire. And such would be my command. So have a care, Smjagol!' 
line 33186=>
line 33187=>####-     Sam looked at his  master with approval, but also with surprise:  there 
line 33188=>was a look in his face and a tone in his voice that he had not known before. 
line 33189=>It had  always been a notion  of his that the kindness of dear Mr. Frodo was 
line 33190=>of  such a high  degree that it  must imply a fair measure of  blindness. Of 
line 33191=>course, he  also  firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. Frodo was the 
line 33192=>wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. Bilbo and 
line 33193=>of Gandalf). Gollum in  his  own  way,  and with  much  more excuse  as  his 
line 33194=>acquaintance was  much briefer, may have _made a  similar mistake, confusing 
line 33195=>kindness and blindness.  At any rate  this speech abashed and terrified him. 
line 33196=>He grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master. 
line 33197=>     Frodo waited patiently for a while,  then he spoke again less  sternly. 
line 33198=>`Come now, Gollum  or Smjagol if  you wish, tell  me of this other way,  and 
line 33199=>show me,  if you can,  what hope  there is in  it,  enough to justify me  in 
line 33200=>turning aside from my plain path. I am in haste.' 
line 33201=>     But  Gollum  was in  a  pitiable state, and  Frodo's  threat  had quite 
line 33202=>unnerved  him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his 
line 33203=>mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled 
line 33204=>on the floor and begged them both to be kind to `poor little Smjagol'. After  
line 33205=>a  while he grew a  little calmer, and Frodo gathered bit by bit that, if  a  
line 33206=>traveller followed the road  that turned west of Ephel D®ath,  he would come 
line 33207=>in  time to a  crossing in a circle of  dark trees. On the right a road went 
line 33208=>down to Osgiliath and the bridges of the Anduin; in the middle the road went 
line 33209=>on southwards.  
line 33210=>     `On,  on,  on,'  said Gollum. `We  never went that way, but they say it 
line 33211=>goes a  hundred leagues, until  you  can  see the Great Water that is  never  
line 33212=>still. There are lots of fishes there, and big birds eat fishes: nice birds:  
line 33213=>but we never  went there, alas no! we never had a chance. And further  still 
line 33214=>there are more  lands, they say, but the Yellow Face is very hot  there, and 
line 33215=>there are seldom any clouds, and the men are  fierce and have dark faces. We 
line 33216=>do not want to see that land.' 
line 33217=>     `No! ' said Frodo. `But do not wander from your road. What of the third 
line 33218=>turning?  ' 
line 33219=>     `O yes, O yes, there is a third way,' said Gollum. `That is the road to 
line 33220=>the  left.  At  once it begins to climb up,  up, winding  and climbing  back 
line 33221=>towards the tall shadows. When it turns round the black rock, you'll see it. 
line 33222=>suddenly you'll see it above you, and you'll want to hide.' 
line 33223=>     `See it, see it? What will you see? ' 
line 33224=>
line 33225=>####-     `The  old fortress, very old, very horrible now. We used  to hear tales 
line 33226=>from the South, when Smjagol was young, long  ago. O yes. we  used  to  tell 
line 33227=>lots of  tales in the evening, sitting by the  banks  of the Great River, in 
line 33228=>the willow-lands, when the River was younger too, gollum, gollum.' He  began 
line 33229=>to weep and mutter. The hobbits waited patiently. 
line 33230=>     `Tales  out  of  the South,' Gollum went on again, `about  the tall Men 
line 33231=>with the shining eyes, and their houses like hills  of stone, and the silver  
line 33232=>crown of their King and his White Tree:  wonderful  tales.  They  built very 
line 33233=>tall towers,  and one they raised was silver -white,  and in it there  was  a  
line 33234=>stone like the Moon, and round it were great  white walls. O yes, there were 
line 33235=>many tales about the Tower of the Moon.' 
line 33236=>     `That would be Minas Ithil that Isildur the son of Elendil built ' said 
line 33237=>Frodo. `It was Isildur who cut off the finger of the Enemy.' 
line 33238=>     `Yes, He has only four  on the Black Hand,  but they are enough,'  said 
line 33239=>Gollum shuddering. 'And He hated Isildur's city.' 
line 33240=>     'What does he not  hate?  '  said Frodo. 'But what has the Tower of the 
line 33241=>Moon to do with us? ' 
line 33242=>     'Well, master, there  it  was and there it is: the  tall tower  and the 
line 33243=>white houses and the wall; but not nice now, not beautiful.  He conquered it  
line 33244=>long ago. It is a very terrible place  now. Travellers shiver  when they see 
line 33245=>it, they creep out of sight, they  avoid its shadow. But master will have to 
line 33246=>go that way. That is the  only other way, For the mountains are lower there, 
line 33247=>and the old road goes up and up, until it reaches  a dark  pass at  the top, 
line 33248=>and then it goes down,  down, again  --  to Gorgoroth.'  His voice sank  to a  
line 33249=>whisper and he shuddered. 
line 33250=>     `But how will  that help us?  ' asked  Sam. `Surely the Enemy knows all 
line 33251=>about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as th is? The  
line 33252=>tower isn't empty, is it? ' 
line 33253=>     `O no, not empty!  ' whispered Gollum. `It seems empty, but it isn't, O 
line 33254=>no!  Very  dreadful things  live  there.  Orcs. yes always  Orcs; but  worse 
line 33255=>things, worse things live  there too. The road climbs right under the shadow  
line 33256=>of the walls and passes the gate. Nothing moves on the  road that they don't  
line 33257=>know about. The things inside know: the Silent Watchers.' 
line 33258=>     `So  that's your advice  is it,' said Sam, 'that  we  should go another  
line 33259=>long march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one,  when we 
line 33260=>get there, if we ever do? ' 
line 33261=>     `No,   no  indeed,'  said  Gollum.  `Hobbits  must  see,  must  try  to 
line 33262=>
line 33263=>####-understand. He does not expect attack that way. His Eye is all round, but it 
line 33264=>attends more to some places than to  others. He can't see everything  all at 
line 33265=>once, not yet. You see, He has conquered all the country west of the Shadowy 
line 33266=>Mountains down to  the River, and He holds the bridges now. He thinks no one 
line 33267=>can  come  to the  Moontower without fighting big battle at the  bridges, or  
line 33268=>getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and He will know about.' 
line 33269=>     'You seem to know a lot about what He's doing and  thinking,' said Sam. 
line 33270=>`Have you been talking to Him lately? Or just hobnobbing with Orcs? ' 
line 33271=>     'Not  nice  hobbit,  not sensible,'  said Gollum, giving Sam  an  angry 
line 33272=>glance  and turning to Frodo. 'Smjagol has talked  to Orcs,  yes  of course, 
line 33273=>before he met master, and to many peoples:  he has walked very far. And what 
line 33274=>he says now many peoples  are saying.  It's here  in the North that  the big 
line 33275=>danger is for Him, and for us. He will come  out of the Black  Gate one day,  
line 33276=>one  day soon. That is the only  way big armies can come. But away down west  
line 33277=>He is not afraid, and there are the Silent Watchers.' 
line 33278=>     `Just so! ' said Sam, not to be put off. `And so we are to walk up  and 
line 33279=>knock at  their gate  and ask if we're on the right road  for Mordor? Or are 
line 33280=>they too silent to answer? It's not. sense. We might as well do it here, and 
line 33281=>save ourselves a long tramp.' 
line 33282=>     'Don't make jokes about it,' hissed Gollum.  `It isn't funny, O no! Not 
line 33283=>amusing. It's  nut sense to try  and get into  Mordor at all. But  if master  
line 33284=>says I must go  or I will go, then he  must try some way. But he must not go 
line 33285=>to the terrible city, O no, of course not. That is where Smjagol helps. nice 
line 33286=>Smjagol. though no one tells him what it is  all about. Smjagol helps again. 
line 33287=>He found it. He knows it.' 
line 33288=>     'What did you find? ' asked Frodo. 
line 33289=>     Gollum crouched down and his voice  sank to a whisper again. 'A  little 
line 33290=>path leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, O yes,  
line 33291=>very long and narrow. And then more stairs. And then'  -- his voice sank even 
line 33292=>lower  -- `a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last  a little cleft, and  a path 
line 33293=>high  above  the  main pass. It was that way  that  Smjagol got  out  of the 
line 33294=>darkness. But it was years ago. The path may  have vanished now; but perhaps 
line 33295=>not, perhaps not.' 
line 33296=>     `I  don't  like the sound of it at  all,' said Sam. `Sounds too easy at 
line 33297=>any rate in the telling. If that path is still there, it'll be guarded  too. 
line 33298=>Wasn't it guarded, Gollum? ' As he said this, he caught or fancied he caught  
line 33299=>a green gleam in Gollum's eye. Gollum muttered but did not reply. 
line 33300=>
line 33301=>####-     'Is  it not guarded? ' asked Frodo sternly. `And did you escape out  of 
line 33302=>the  darkness,  Smjagol? Were you  not rather  permitted  to  depart upon an 
line 33303=>errand? That at  least is w hat Aragorn  thought,  who found you by the Dead 
line 33304=>Marshes some years ago.' 
line 33305=>     'It's  a lie! ' hissed Gollum, and an evil light came into  his eyes at 
line 33306=>the  naming of Aragorn. `He lied on me, yes he did. I did  escape, all by my 
line 33307=>poor  self.  Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious; and I have searched 
line 33308=>and searched, of course I have. But not for the  Black One. The Precious was 
line 33309=>ours, it was mine I tell you. I did escape.' 
line 33310=>     Frodo felt a  strange certainty that in this matter Gollum was for once 
line 33311=>not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a 
line 33312=>way out of Mordor, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. For  
line 33313=>one thing,  he noted  that Gollum used  I, and that  seemed usually to be  a  
line 33314=>sign, on its rare appearances. that some remnants of old truth and sincerity 
line 33315=>were  for  the moment on top. But even  if Gollum  could  be trusted on this 
line 33316=>point, Frodo did not forget the wiles  of the  Enemy. The 'escape' may  have  
line 33317=>been allowed  or arranged, and well known in the Dark Tower. And in any case 
line 33318=>Gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back. 
line 33319=>     'I ask you again,' he said: `is not this secret way guarded? ' 
line 33320=>     But the name of Aragorn had put Gollum into a sullen  mood. He had  all 
line 33321=>the injured air of a liar suspected when for once  he has told the truth. or  
line 33322=>part of it. He did not answer. 
line 33323=>     'Is it not guarded? ' Frodo repeated. 
line 33324=>     `Yes, yes,  perhaps.  No safe places  in  this  country,'  said  Gollum 
line 33325=>sulkily.  'No safe  places. But  master must try it or  go home.  . No other  
line 33326=>way.' They could not get him to say more. The name of the perilous place and 
line 33327=>the high pass he could not tell, or would not. 
line 33328=>     Its  name was Cirith Ungol, a name of dreadful  rumour.  Aragorn  could  
line 33329=>perhaps have told them that name  and its  significance: Gandalf  would have 
line 33330=>warned  them. But they  were  alone, and Aragorn was  far away, and  Gandalf 
line 33331=>stood amid the ruin of Isengard and strove with Saruman, delayed by treason. 
line 33332=>Yet even  as he spoke his last words to Saruman, and the palantnr crashed in 
line 33333=>fire upon the steps of Orthanc. his thought was ever upon Frodo and Samwise, 
line 33334=>over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity. 
line 33335=>     Maybe Frodo  felt  it,  not knowing it, as he  had upon Amon  Hen, even 
line 33336=>though he believed that Gandalf was  gone, gone  for ever into the shadow in 
line 33337=>Moria far  away. He  sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his  head 
line 33338=>
line 33339=>####-bowed, striving  to recall  all that Gandalf had  said to him. But  for this 
line 33340=>choice he could recall no counsel. Indeed Gandalf's guidance had  been taken 
line 33341=>from them too  soon, too  soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away. 
line 33342=>How they should enter it at the last  Gandalf had not said. Perhaps he could 
line 33343=>not say. Into the stronghold of  the Enemy in the North, into Dol Guldur, he 
line 33344=>had  once  ventured.  But  into  Mordor,  to  the Mountain  of  Fire and  to 
line 33345=>Barad-dyr, since the Dark Lord  rose in power again, had  he ever   journeyed 
line 33346=>there?  Frodo did not think  so. And here he was  a little halfling from the 
line 33347=>Shire, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where 
line 33348=>the  great ones could  not go, or dared not go. It was an evil  fate. But he 
line 33349=>had  taken it   on himself in his  own sitting-room in the far-off spring  of 
line 33350=>another  year,  so remote now that it was like a chapter  in a story  of the 
line 33351=>world's  youth, when the Trees  of Silver and Gold were still in bloom. This 
line 33352=>was  an evil choice. Which way should  he choose? And if both  led to terror  
line 33353=>and death, what good lay in choice?  
line 33354=>     The day drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little  grey hollow where 
line 33355=>they lay,  so  near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could 
line 33356=>be felt, as if it  were a  thick veil that cut  them off from all the  world 
line 33357=>about them. Above them was a dome  of pale sky  barred  with fleeting smoke, 
line 33358=>but it seemed high and far away. as if seen through great deeps of air heavy 
line 33359=>with brooding thought. 
line 33360=>     Not even an eagle  poised  against the sun would have marked the hobbits 
line 33361=>sitting there, under  the weight of doom, silent, µ not moving, shrouded  in 
line 33362=>their  thin  grey  cloaks. For a moment he  might  have  paused  to consider  
line 33363=>Gollum,  a  tiny  figure sprawling  on  the ground:  there  perhaps  lay the 
line 33364=>famished skeleton of some child of Men, its ragged garment still clinging to  
line 33365=>it, its long arms and legs almost bone -white and bone-thin: no flesh worth a  
line 33366=>peck. 
line 33367=>     Frodo's head  was bowed over his knees, but Sam leaned back, with hands 
line 33368=>behind  his head, staring  out of his hood at the empty sky.  At least for a  
line 33369=>long while it was empty. Then presently Sam thought he saw a  dark bird-like 
line 33370=>figure wheel into the circle of his  sight, and hover, and  then wheel  away 
line 33371=>again.  Two more followed,  and then a fourth. They were very  small to look 
line 33372=>at,  yet  he knew,  somehow, that  they  were huge,  with a  vast stretch of 
line 33373=>pinion,  flying  at a great height.  He covered his eyes and  bent  forward, 
line 33374=>cowering. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of 
line 33375=>the Black Riders, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind 
line 33376=>
line 33377=>####-and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: 
line 33378=>the menace  was  more  remote.  But menace  it was. Frodo  felt it  too. His 
line 33379=>thought was broken. He stirred and shivered, but he did not look up.  Gollum 
line 33380=>huddled  himself together like a cornered spider. The winged shapes wheeled, 
line 33381=>and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to Mordor. 
line 33382=>     Sam took a deep breath. `The Riders are a bout again, up in the air,' he 
line 33383=>said in a hoarse whisper. 'I saw them. Do you think they  could see us? They 
line 33384=>were very  high up. And if  they are Black Riders same as  before, then they 
line 33385=>can't see much by daylight, can they?  ' 
line 33386=>     'No, perhaps not,' said Frodo.  `But their steeds  could see. And these 
line 33387=>winged creatures that they ride on now, they can probably  see more than any 
line 33388=>other  creature.  They are like great  carrion birds. They  are  looking for  
line 33389=>something: the Enemy is on the watch, I fear.' 
line 33390=>     The feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding  silence was broken. For  
line 33391=>some  time  they had been cut  off  from  the  world, as if  in an invisible 
line 33392=>island; now they were laid bare again, peril had returned.  But  still Frodo 
line 33393=>did not  speak to Gollum or make h is choice. His eyes were closed, as if  he 
line 33394=>were dreaming, or looking  inward into his  heart  and memory.  At  last  he 
line 33395=>stirred  and  stood up,  and  it seemed that  he was  about to  speak and to 
line 33396=>decide. But `hark!' he said. `What is that?' 
line 33397=>     A new  fear  was upon  them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At 
line 33398=>first it seemed a long way off,  but it drew  nearer:  it was coming towards 
line 33399=>them. It leaped into all their minds that the Black Wings had spied them and 
line 33400=>had sent armed soldiers to seize  them: no speed seemed too great  for these 
line 33401=>terrible servants of Sauron.  They  crouched, listening.  The voices and the 
line 33402=>clink  of weapons and harness were very close.  Frodo and Sam loosened their 
line 33403=>small swords in their sheaths. Flight was impossible. 
line 33404=>     Gollum  rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the  lip of  the hollow. 
line 33405=>Very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch,  until he could peer over it 
line 33406=>between  two  broken points of stone. He remained there without  moving  for  
line 33407=>some time, making no sound.  Presen tly the voices began to recede again, and 
line 33408=>then they slowly faded away. Far off  a  horn  blew on  the ramparts of  the 
line 33409=>Morannon. Then quietly Gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow.  
line 33410=>     'More  Men  going to Mordor,' he said in a low  voice. `Dark faces.  We 
line 33411=>have not seen Men like  these before, no, Smjagol has not.  They are fierce. 
line 33412=>They have  black  eyes, and long  black hair, and gold rings in  their ears;  
line 33413=>yes, lots  of beautiful gold. And  some have  red paint on their cheeks, and 
line 33414=>
line 33415=>####-red cloaks;  and their  flags are red, and the tips of their spears; and they 
line 33416=>have round shields,  yellow and black with big  spikes. Not nice; very cruel 
line 33417=>wicked Men they look. Almost as bad as Orcs, and much bigger. Smjagol 
line 33418=>thinks 
line 33419=>they have come out of the South beyond the Great River's end:  they came  up 
line 33420=>that  road. They have passed  on  to the  Black Gate; but  more may  follow.  
line 33421=>Always  more  people  coming  to Mordor.  One  day  all the peoples  will be 
line 33422=>inside.' 
line 33423=>     `Were there any oliphaunts?' asked  Sam,  forgetting his  fear  in  his 
line 33424=>eagerness for news of strange places.  
line 33425=>     `No, no oliphaunts. What are oliphaunts? ' said Gollum. 
line 33426=>     Sam stood up, putting his hands  behind his back (as he always did when  
line 33427=>'speaking poetry'), and began: 
line 33428=>     Grey as a mouse, 
line 33429=>     Big as a house. 
line 33430=>     Nose like a snake, 
line 33431=>     I make the earth shake, 
line 33432=>     As I tramp through the grass; 
line 33433=>     Trees crack as I pass. 
line 33434=>     With horns in my mouth  
line 33435=>     I walk in the South, 
line 33436=>     Flapping big ears. 
line 33437=>     Beyond count of years 
line 33438=>     I stump round and round, 
line 33439=>     Never lie on the ground, 
line 33440=>     Not even to die. 
line 33441=>     Oliphaunt am I, 
line 33442=>     Biggest of all, 
line 33443=>     Huge, old, and tall. 
line 33444=>     If ever you'd met me 
line 33445=>     You wouldn't forget me. 
line 33446=>     If you never do, 
line 33447=>     You won't think I'm true; 
line 33448=>     But old O liphaunt am I, 
line 33449=>     And I never lie. 
line 33450=>     'That,'  said Sam, when he  had finished  reciting, `that's a rhyme  we 
line 33451=>have in the Shire. Nonsense maybe, and maybe not. But we have our tales too, 
line 33452=>
line 33453=>####-and news out of the South, you know.  In the old days hobbits used  to go on 
line 33454=>their travels now and again. Not that many ever came back,  and not that all 
line 33455=>they said  was believed: news from Bree,  and not sure  as Shiretalk , as the 
line 33456=>sayings  go. But I've heard tales of the big folk down away in the Sunlands.  
line 33457=>Swertings we call 'em in our tales;  and they ride on oliphaunts, 'tis said, 
line 33458=>when they fight. They put houses and towers  on  the oliphauntses backs  and 
line 33459=>all,  and  the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at one another. So  when you  
line 33460=>said  "Men out of the  South, all  in red and gold;" I said  "were there any 
line 33461=>oliphaunts? " For if there was, I was going to  take a look, risk or no. But 
line 33462=>now I don't suppose I'll ever see  an oliphaunt. Maybe there ain't no such a  
line 33463=>beast.' He sighed. 
line 33464=>     `No, no oliphaunts,' said Gollum again.   'Smjagol has not heard of them. 
line 33465=>He does not want to see them. He does not want  them to be. Smjagol wants to 
line 33466=>go away from here and hide somewhere safer. Smjagol wants master to go. 
line 33467=>Nice 
line 33468=>master, won't he come with Smjagol? ' 
line 33469=>     Frodo stood up. He had laughed in the midst  of  all his cares when Sam 
line 33470=>trotted out the old fireside rhyme  of Oliphaunt, and the laugh had released 
line 33471=>him from hesitation. `I  wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with Gandalf on a 
line 33472=>white one at their head,' he  said.  `Then  we'd break  a way into this evil 
line 33473=>land,  perhaps.  But  we've not; just our  own tired legs, that's all. Well, 
line 33474=>Smjagol, the third turn may turn the best. I will come with you.' 
line 33475=>     'Good  master,  wise master,  nice master!'  cried  Gollum in  delight, 
line 33476=>patting Frodo's knees. `Good master! Then rest  now, nice hobbits, under the 
line 33477=>shadow of  the stones, close under the stones! Rest and lie quiet, till  the 
line 33478=>Yellow Face goes away. Then we can go quickly. Soft  and quick as shadows 
line 33479=>we 
line 33480=>must be!' 
line 33481=>
line 33482=>####-<h4>Chapter 4.</h4> <br> Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit 
line 33483=>
line 33484=> 
line 33485=> 
line 33486=>     For the few hours of daylight that were left they rested, shifting into 
line 33487=>the shade as the sun moved, until  at last the shadow of the western  rim of 
line 33488=>their  dell grew long, and darkness filled all  the hollow. Then they ate  a  
line 33489=>little,  and drank  sparingly.  Gollum  ate nothing, but  he  accepted water  
line 33490=>gladly. 
line 33491=>     `Soon get more now,' he said, licking  his lips. `Good water  runs down 
line 33492=>in  streams to  the Great River,  nice water in the lands  we are  going to. 
line 33493=>Smjagol will get food there too, perhaps. He's very hungry, yes, gollum! ' He 
line 33494=>set his two large flat hands on his  shrunken belly, and a pale  green light 
line 33495=>came into his eyes. 
line 33496=>     The  dusk was deep  when at length  they  set  out,  creeping over  the 
line 33497=>westward rim of the  dell, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on 
line 33498=>the borders of the road: The moon was now three nights from the full, but it  
line 33499=>did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight, and the  early night 
line 33500=>was very dark. A single red light burned high up in the Tower s of the Teeth,  
line 33501=>but  otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch  on the 
line 33502=>Morannon. 
line 33503=>     For  many  miles the red eye  seemed  to  stare at  them as they  fled, 
line 33504=>stumbling through a barren  stony country.  They did not dare  to  take  the 
line 33505=>road, but they  kept  it  on their left, following its line as  well as they 
line 33506=>could at a little distance.  At last, when  night  was growing old and  they 
line 33507=>were already weary, for they had taken only one short rest, the eye dwindled  
line 33508=>to a small fiery point a nd then vanished: they had turned the dark  northern 
line 33509=>shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards. 
line 33510=>     With hearts  strangely  lightened they  now rested again, but  not  for  
line 33511=>long. They were  not going  quick enough for Gollum. By his reckoning it was 
line 33512=>nearly thirty leagues from the  Morannon to the cross-roads above Osgiliath, 
line 33513=>and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys. So soon they struggled 
line 33514=>on once  more,  until the  dawn  began  to  spread  slowly in the wide  grey 
line 33515=>solitude. They had then  walked almost eight leagues; and the hobbits  could 
line 33516=>not have gone any further, even if they had dared. 
line 33517=>     The  growing  light revealed to them  a  land already, less  barren and 
line 33518=>ruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their  left, but near at 
line 33519=>hand  they could  see the southward road,  now  bearing away  from the black 
line 33520=>
line 33521=>####-roots of the  hills and  slanting  westwards.  Beyond it were slopes covered 
line 33522=>with  sombre trees  like  dark clouds. but  all about  them  lay  a  tumbled 
line 33523=>heathland, grown with ling and broom  and cornel, and other shrubs that they 
line 33524=>did not know. Here and there they saw knots  of tall pine-trees.  The hearts 
line 33525=>of the hobbits rose again a little in spite of weariness: the  air was fresh 
line 33526=>and  fragrant, and it reminded them  of the uplands of the Northfarthing far 
line 33527=>away. It seemed good to be reprieved, to  walk in a land that had  only been 
line 33528=>for a few years  under the dominion of  the Dark Lord and was not yet fallen 
line 33529=>wholly into  decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the Black Gate 
line 33530=>that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy heights. 
line 33531=>They looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes 
line 33532=>while the light lasted. 
line 33533=>     The  day passed uneasily. They lay deep  in the heather and counted out 
line 33534=>the  slow hours, in which  there seemed  little  change; for they were still 
line 33535=>under the shadows of the Ephel D®ath, and the sun was veiled. Frodo slept at 
line 33536=>times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting Gollum or too tired to trouble 
line 33537=>about him; but Sam found it difficult to do more than doze, even when Gollum 
line 33538=>was plainly fast  asleep,  whiffling  and twitching in  his  secret  dreams.  
line 33539=>Hunger,  perhaps,  more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long 
line 33540=>for a good homely meal, `something hot out of the pot'. 
line 33541=>     As soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night, they 
line 33542=>started  out  again. In  a little while  Gollum led  them  down  on  to  the 
line 33543=>southward road; and after that they went  on more quickly, though the danger 
line 33544=>was greater. Their ears were strained  for the sound of hoof or  foot on the 
line 33545=>road  ahead, or following them  from behind;  but the night passed, and they 
line 33546=>heard no sound of walker or rider. 
line 33547=>     The  road had been made in  a long lost  time:  and  for perhaps thirty 
line 33548=>miles below  the  Morannon it had been  newly repaired, but as it went south  
line 33549=>the wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of Men of old could still be seen 
line 33550=>in its straight sure  flight and level course:  now and again it cut its way 
line 33551=>through hillside slopes, or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of 
line 33552=>enduring masonry; but at  last  all signs  of stonework faded,  save  for  a  
line 33553=>broken pillar  here and  there,  peering out of bushes  at  the side, or old 
line 33554=>paving-stones still  lurking  amid weeds  and  moss.  Heather  and  trees and 
line 33555=>bracken  scrambled down  and  overhung  the banks, or sprawled out over  the 
line 33556=>surface. It dwindled at last to a country cart -road little  used; but it did 
line 33557=>not wind:  it held on its  own sure course and  guided them by  the swiftest  
line 33558=>
line 33559=>####-way. 
line 33560=>     So  they  passed into the  northern marches  of that land that Men once 
line 33561=>called Ithilien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift -falling streams.  
line 33562=>The  night  became  fine  under  star and round moon, and  it seemed  to the 
line 33563=>hobbits that the  fragrance  of the air grew as they went  forward; and from 
line 33564=>the  blowing and muttering of Gollum it  seemed that he noticed it  too, and 
line 33565=>did not relish it. At the first signs  of day  they halted  again.  They had 
line 33566=>come to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer -sided in  the middle,  by 
line 33567=>which the road clove its way through a stony  ridge. Now they climbed up the 
line 33568=>westward bank and looked abroad. 
line 33569=>     Day  was  opening in the sky, and they saw  that the mountains were now  
line 33570=>much further  off, receding ea stward in  a long curve  that was lost in  the 
line 33571=>distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran  down into dim 
line 33572=>hazes far  below. All about them were small woods of resinous trees, fir and 
line 33573=>cedar  and cypress. and other  kinds  unknown in the Shire, with wide glades 
line 33574=>among them; and  everywhere there was a wealth  of sweet -smelling  herbs and 
line 33575=>shrubs. The long journey from Rivendell had brought them far south of  their 
line 33576=>own  land,  but not until now in this more sheltered region had the  hobbits 
line 33577=>felt the change of clime.  Here Spring was  already busy about them:  fronds 
line 33578=>pierced  moss  and mould,  larches were  green-fingered, small flowers  were 
line 33579=>opening in the turf,  birds were singing. Ithilien, the garden of Gondor now 
line 33580=>desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness.  
line 33581=>     South  and  west  it looked  towards  the  warm lower vales  of Anduin, 
line 33582=>shielded  from   the  east  by  the  Ephel  D®ath  and  yet  not  under  the 
line 33583=>mountain-shadow,  protected  from the north  by the  Emyn Muil, open  to the 
line 33584=>southern  airs and the moist winds from the Sea far  away.  Many great trees 
line 33585=>grew there,  planted  long ago,  falling  into untended age amid a  riot  of 
line 33586=>careless descendants;  and groves and  thickets there  were of tamarisk  and 
line 33587=>pungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and there were junipers and myrtles; 
line 33588=>and  thymes that grew in  bushes, or with their woody creeping stems mantled 
line 33589=>in deep tapestries the hidden stones; sages of many kinds putting forth blue 
line 33590=>flowers, or  red,  or pale green; and  marjorams and new-sprouting parsleys,  
line 33591=>and many  herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of Sam. The grots 
line 33592=>and  rocky  walls were  already  starred  with  saxifrages  and  stonecrops.  
line 33593=>Primeroles  and anemones were awake in the  filbert -brakes; and asphodel and 
line 33594=>many  lily-flowers  nodded their half-opened heads in the grass: deep  green 
line 33595=>grass beside  the pools,  where  falling streams  halted  in cool hollows on 
line 33596=>
line 33597=>####-their journey down to Anduin. 
line 33598=>     The  travellers  turned their backs on the road and  went downhill.  As 
line 33599=>they walked, brushing their  way through bush  and herb,  sweet  odours rose 
line 33600=>about  them. Gollum coughed and retched; but the hobbits  breathed deep, and 
line 33601=>suddenly Sam laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. They followed a  stream 
line 33602=>that went  quickly down before them. Presently  it  brought them to a  small 
line 33603=>clear lake in a shallow dell: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient stone 
line 33604=>basin, the carven rim of  which was  almost wholly  covered  with mosses and 
line 33605=>rose-brambles;  iris-swords stood in  ranks about it. and water -lily  leaves 
line 33606=>floated on  its dark gently-rippling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and 
line 33607=>spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end. 
line 33608=>     Here they washed  themselves and  drank  their  fill at  the in-falling 
line 33609=>freshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for  this 
line 33610=>land, fair-seeming  still, was nonetheless now territory of  the Enemy. They 
line 33611=>had not come  very far from the road, and yet even  in so short a space they 
line 33612=>had seen  scars of  the  old wars, and the newer wounds made by the Orcs and 
line 33613=>other foul servants of the Dark Lord:  a  pit of uncovered filth and refuse; 
line 33614=>trees hewn down wantonly  and  left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign 
line 33615=>of the Eye cut in rude strokes on their bark. 
line 33616=>     Sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake. smelling and touching the 
line 33617=>unfamiliar  plants  and  trees,  forgetful for  the moment  of  Mordor,  was 
line 33618=>reminded suddenly  of their ever -present peril. He  stumbled on a ring still 
line 33619=>scorched by fire,  and in the midst of it  he  found  a pile  of charred and 
line 33620=>broken  bones  and skulls.  The  swift growth  of the wild  with  briar  and 
line 33621=>eglantine and trailing  clematis was already drawing a veil  over this place 
line 33622=>of dreadful feast and slaughter;  but it was not ancient. He hurried back to  
line 33623=>his companions, but he said nothing: the bones  were best  left in peace and 
line 33624=>not pawed and routed by Gollum. 
line 33625=>     `Let's  find a place to lie up in,' he said. 'Not lower down. Higher up 
line 33626=>for me.' 
line 33627=>     A  little way back above the lake they found a  deep brown bed  of last  
line 33628=>year's fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved  bay-trees climbing up a  
line 33629=>steep bank  that was crowned with old cedars. Here they  decided to rest and 
line 33630=>pass  the day, which already promised to be  bright and warm. A good day for 
line 33631=>strolling  on their way along the groves and glades of Ithilien; but  though 
line 33632=>Orcs may shun the sunlight. there were too many places here where they could 
line 33633=>lie hid  and  watch;  and  other  evil  eyes were  abroad:  Sauron had  many 
line 33634=>
line 33635=>####-servants. Gollum, in any case, would not move under  the  Yellow. Face. Soon 
line 33636=>it  would look over the dark  ridges of the Ephel D®ath, and he would  faint 
line 33637=>and cower in the light and heat. 
line 33638=>     Sam had  been giving earnest thought to food as they  marched. Now that 
line 33639=>the despair  of  the  impassable Gate was behind  him,  he did  not feel  so 
line 33640=>inclined as his master  to take no thought  for  their livelihood beyond the 
line 33641=>end of their errand;  and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread 
line 33642=>of the  Elves for worse times ahead.  Six  days or more had  passed since he 
line 33643=>reckoned that they had only a bare supply for three weeks. 
line 33644=>     'If we  reach the Fire in  that time, we'll be lucky at this rate! ' he 
line 33645=>thought. `And we might be wanting to get back. We might! ' 
line 33646=>     Besides,  at  the  end  of a  long  night -march, and  after bathing and 
line 33647=>drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper,  or a breakfast, by 
line 33648=>the fire  in  the old kitchen  at  Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An  
line 33649=>idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun  to sneak off 
line 33650=>on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern. 
line 33651=>     `Hi! Gollum! ' said Sam. `Where are you going?  Hunting? Well see here, 
line 33652=>old  noser, you don't like our  food,  and I'd  not  be sorry  for  a change 
line 33653=>myself.  Your new motto's always ready to help . Could you find anything  fit 
line 33654=>for a hungry hobbit? ' 
line 33655=>     `Yes, perhaps,  yes,' said Gollum. `Smjagol always helps, if they  asks 
line 33656=>-- if they asks nicely.' 
line 33657=>     `Right!' said Sam `I does ask. And if that isn't nice enough, I begs.' 
line 33658=>     Gollum disappeared.  He  was away some  time, and  Frodo  after  a  few 
line 33659=>mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown  fern and went to sleep. Sam 
line 33660=>looked  at  him. The early  daylight  was only just creeping  down into  the 
line 33661=>shadows u nder the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and  his 
line 33662=>hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly 
line 33663=>of Frodo as he had lain, asleep in  the  house of Elrond,  after his  deadly 
line 33664=>wound. Then as  he  had  kept watch Sam  had  noticed that at times  a light 
line 33665=>seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light  was even clearer and  
line 33666=>stronger. Frodo's face was peaceful, the marks of fear and care had left it; 
line 33667=>but it looked old,  old and beautiful, as  if the  chiselling of the shaping 
line 33668=>years was now revealed  in  many  fine lines  that  had before  been hidden, 
line 33669=>though the  identity of the face was not changed. Not that Sam Gamgee put it 
line 33670=>that  way to himself.  He shook  his  head, as if finding words useless, and 
line 33671=>murmured:  `I  love  him. He's  like that, and  sometimes it shines through, 
line 33672=>
line 33673=>####-somehow. But I love him, whether or no.' 
line 33674=>     Gollum returned quietly  and  peered over  Sam's  shoulder.  Looking at 
line 33675=>Frodo, he shut his eyes  and crawled away without a sound. Sam came  to him a  
line 33676=>moment later and found him  chewing something  and muttering  to himself. 
line 33677=>On 
line 33678=>the ground beside him lay two small rabbits, which he was  beginning to  eye 
line 33679=>greedily. 
line 33680=>     'Smjagol always helps,' he said. `He has brought rabbits, nice rabbits.  
line 33681=>But ma ster has gone  to sleep,  and perhaps Sam wants to sleep. Doesn't want 
line 33682=>rabbits now?  Smjagol  tries  to help,  but he can't catch  things all in  a  
line 33683=>minute.' 
line 33684=>     Sam,  however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least 
line 33685=>not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of  course,  can cook, for they  begin to 
line 33686=>learn the art before their letters (which  many never reach):  but Sam was a  
line 33687=>good  cook, even by  hobbit  reckoning,  and he had  done a good deal of the 
line 33688=>camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a  chance. He  still  hopefully 
line 33689=>carried some of his gear in his pack: a  small tinder -box, two small shallow 
line 33690=>pans,  the smaller fitting into  the  larger; inside them  a wooden spoon, a  
line 33691=>short  two-pronged  fork and  some skewers were  stowed;  and hidden  at the 
line 33692=>bottom of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But 
line 33693=>he needed a  fire, and other things besides. He thought for  a bit, while he 
line 33694=>took out his  knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits.  
line 33695=>He was not going to leave Frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes. 
line 33696=>     'Now,  Gollum,'  he said, 'I've  another job for you. Go and fill these 
line 33697=>pans with water, and bring  'em back!  ' 
line 33698=>     'Smjagol will fetch water, yes,' said Gollum. 'But what does the hobbit 
line 33699=>want all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.' 
line 33700=>     'Never you mind,' said Sam. `If you  can't guess, you'll soon find out. 
line 33701=>And  the  sooner you fetch the  water,  the  sooner you'll  learn. Don't you  
line 33702=>damage one of my pans, or I'll carve you into mincemeat.' 
line 33703=>     While Gollum was  away Sam took  another look  at Frodo.  He  was still 
line 33704=>sleeping quietly, but Sam was now struck  most  by the leanness  of his face 
line 33705=>and hands. 'Too thin and drawn he is,' he muttered. 'Not right for a hobbit. 
line 33706=>If I can get these coneys cooked, I'm going to wake him up.' 
line 33707=>     Sam gathered a pile of the driest fern, and then scrambled  up the bank  
line 33708=>collecting a  bundle of twigs and broken wood; the fallen branch of a  cedar 
line 33709=>at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the 
line 33710=>
line 33711=>####-bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid  his fuel 
line 33712=>in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It  
line 33713=>made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping  
line 33714=>over  his  fire,   shielding it and  building  it up with heavier  wood, when 
line 33715=>Gollum returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself.  
line 33716=>     He set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what Sam was doing. He gave 
line 33717=>a thin hissing shriek, and seemed to be both frightened and angry. `Ach! Sss 
line 33718=>-- no!' he cried. `No! Silly  hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! They mustn't do 
line 33719=>it!' 
line 33720=>     `Mustn't do what?' asked Sam in surprise. 
line 33721=>     `Not make  the nassty  red  tongues,'  hissed Gollum. `Fire, fire! It's 
line 33722=>dangerous, yes it is.  It burns, it kills. And it will  bring enemies, yes it 
line 33723=>will.' 
line 33724=>     'I don't think so,' said  Sam. `Don't see  why it  should, if you don't 
line 33725=>put wet stuff on it and make a  smother.  But if it does, it does. I'm going 
line 33726=>to risk it, anyhow. I'm going to stew these coneys.' 
line 33727=>     'Stew the rabbits!'  squealed Gollum in  dismay. `Spoil  beautiful meat 
line 33728=>Smjagol  saved for  you,  poor  hungry  Smjagol! What for? What  for,  silly 
line 33729=>hobbit? They are young, they are tender, they are nice. Eat them, eat them!' 
line 33730=>He clawed a t the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire. 
line 33731=>     `Now, now! ' said Sam. `Each to his own fashion. Our bread chokes  you, 
line 33732=>and raw  coney chokes me. If you give  me a coney, the coney's mine, see, to 
line 33733=>cook,  if  I have  a mind. And  I have.  You needn't watch me.  Go and catch  
line 33734=>another  and eat it as you  fancy  -- somewhere private  and out o' my sight. 
line 33735=>Then you  won't see the  fire, and  I shan't see you, and we'll both  be the 
line 33736=>happier. I'll see the fire don't smoke, if that's any comfort to you.' 
line 33737=>     Gollum withdrew grumbling,  and  crawled  into  the  fern.  Sam  busied 
line 33738=>himself with his pans. `What a hobbit needs with coney,' he said to himself,  
line 33739=>`is some  herbs and roots,  especially taters -- not to mention bread. Herbs 
line 33740=>we can manage, seemingly.' 
line 33741=>     `Gollum!'  he  called softly. `Third  time pays  for all. I  want  some 
line 33742=>herbs.' Gollum's head peeped out of the  fern,  but  his looks  were neither  
line 33743=>helpful  nor friendly.  `A few  bay-leaves, some  thyme and sage, will do  -- 
line 33744=>before the water boils,' said Sam. 
line 33745=>     `No! ' said  Gollum. `Smjagol is  not pleased. And Smjagol doesn't like 
line 33746=>smelly leaves. He doesn't eat  grasses or roots,  no precious, not till he's 
line 33747=>starving or very sick, poor Smjagol. ' 
line 33748=>
line 33749=>####-     `Smjagol'll get  into real true hot water , when this water boils, if he 
line 33750=>don't do  as  he's  asked,' growled  Sam.  `Sam'll put  his head in it,  yes 
line 33751=>precious. And I'd make him look for turnips  and carrots, and taters too, if 
line 33752=>it was  the time o'  the  year. I'll bet there's all sorts  of  good  things 
line 33753=>running wild in this country. I'd give a lot for half a dozen taters.' 
line 33754=>     `Smjagol won't  go, O no precious, not this time,' hissed Gollum. `He's 
line 33755=>frightened, and  he's very tired, and this hobbit's  not nice,  not nice  at 
line 33756=>all.  Smjagol won't  grub for roots and  carrotses  and  --  taters.  What's 
line 33757=>taters, precious, eh, what's taters?  
line 33758=>     `Po-ta -toes,' said Sam. 'The  Gaffer's delight, and  rare  good ballast  
line 33759=>for an empty belly. But you won't find any, so you needn't look. But be good  
line 33760=>Smjagol  and  fetch me the herbs, and I'll think better of you. What's more, 
line 33761=>if you turn  over a new leaf, and keep it turned, I'll cook you  some taters 
line 33762=>one of  these days. I will: fried fish  and chips served by  S.  Gamgee. You  
line 33763=>couldn't say no to that.' 
line 33764=>     `Yes, yes we could. Spoiling nice fish, scorching it. Give me fish now, 
line 33765=>and keep nassty chips! ' 
line 33766=>     `Oh you're hopeless,' said Sam. 'Go to sleep!' 
line 33767=>     In  the end he had to find what  he wanted for himself;  but he did not 
line 33768=>have to  go far, not out  of sight of the  place where his master lay, still 
line 33769=>sleeping. For a while  Sam sat musing, and  tending the fire till  the water  
line 33770=>boiled. The daylight grew  and the  air became  warm; the dew faded off turf 
line 33771=>and leaf. Soon  the  rabbits  cut  up  lay simmering in their pans with  the 
line 33772=>bunched herbs. Almost Sam fell asleep as the  time went by. He let them stew 
line 33773=>for close on an hour, testing them now and again with  his fork, and tasting 
line 33774=>the broth. 
line 33775=>     When  he thought  all  was ready he lifted the pans off  the  fire, and 
line 33776=>crept along to Frodo. Frodo  half opened his eyes as Sam stood over him, and 
line 33777=>then he  wakened from  his  dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of 
line 33778=>peace. 
line 33779=>     `Hullo, Sam! ' he said. `Not resting? Is  anything wrong?  What  is the 
line 33780=>time?  ' 
line 33781=>     `About a couple of hours after daybreak,' said  Sam, `and  nigh on half 
line 33782=>past  eight  by  Shire  clocks, maybe. But nothing's wrong. Though  it ain't  
line 33783=>quite what I'd call right: no stock, no onions, no taters. I've got a bit of 
line 33784=>a stew for you, and some broth, Mr. Frodo.  Do you good. You'll have  to sup 
line 33785=>it in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it's  cooled a bit. I haven't  
line 33786=>
line 33787=>####-brought no bowls, nor nothing proper.' 
line 33788=>     Frodo  yawned and stretched.  'You  should  have been  resting Sam,' he 
line 33789=>said. 'And lighting   a fire  was dangerous  in these  parts.  But I do  feel 
line 33790=>hungry. Hmm! Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed? ' 
line 33791=>     'A  present from Smjagol,' said Sam: `a brace o' young coneys; though I 
line 33792=>fancy Gollum's regretting them now. But there's nought to go with them but a 
line 33793=>few herbs.' 
line 33794=>     Sam and  his master sat just within  the  fern-brake and ate their stew 
line 33795=>from the pans, sharing the  old fork and spoon. They allowed themselves half 
line 33796=>a piece of the Elvish waybread each. It seemed a feast. 
line 33797=>     'Wheew!  Gollum! ' Sam called and whistled softly. 'Come on! Still time 
line 33798=>to  change your  mind.  There's some left, if you want to try stewed coney.' 
line 33799=>There was no answer. 
line 33800=>     `Oh  well, I suppose he's gone off to find something for himself. We'll 
line 33801=>finish it,' said Sam. 
line 33802=>     `And then you must take some sleep,' said Frodo. 
line 33803=>     `Don't you drop off, while  I'm nodding, Mr. Frodo. I  don't  feel  too 
line 33804=>sure  of  him.  There's  a  good  deal  of  Stinker -the bad  Gollum, if  you  
line 33805=>understand me-in him still, and it's getting stronger again. Not but what  I 
line 33806=>think he'd try to throttle  me first  now. We don't see eye to eye, and he's 
line 33807=>not pleased with Sam, O no precious, not pleased at all.' 
line 33808=>     They finished, and Sam went off to the stream to rinse his  gear. As he 
line 33809=>stood  up to return, he looked back up the  slope. At that moment he saw the 
line 33810=>sun  rise out of the reek, or haze, or dark shadow, or whatever it was, that 
line 33811=>lay  ever to the east, and it sent its  golden beams down upon the trees and 
line 33812=>glades about him. Then  he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey,  smoke, plain 
line 33813=>to see as it  caught  the sunlight, rising  from a thicket above him. With a  
line 33814=>shock  he realized that  this was the smoke  from  his  little cooking-fire, 
line 33815=>which he had neglected to put out. 
line 33816=>     `That won't do! Never thought  it  would show like that! ' he muttered, 
line 33817=>and  he started to hurry back. Suddenly he halted and listened. Had he heard 
line 33818=>a whistle  or not? Or was  it the  call of some strange  bird?  If it was  a  
line 33819=>whistle, it did  not  come from Frodo's direction. There it went again  from 
line 33820=>another place! Sam began to run as well as he could uphill. 
line 33821=>     He found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had kindled 
line 33822=>some  fern  at  the edge  of the fire,  and the fern blazing  up had set the 
line 33823=>turves  smouldering.  Hastily he stamped  out  what  was left of  the  fire, 
line 33824=>
line 33825=>####-scattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole.  Then he crept back to 
line 33826=>Frodo. 
line 33827=>     'Did  you hear a whistle, and  what sounded like an answer? ' he asked. 
line 33828=>`A few minutes back. I hope  it was  only a bird,  but it didn't  sound quite 
line 33829=>like that: more like  somebody mimicking  a  bird-call, I  thought.  And I'm 
line 33830=>afraid my bit of fire's been smoking. Now if I've gone  and brought trouble, 
line 33831=>I'll never forgive myself. Nor won't have a chance, maybe! ' 
line 33832=>     `Hush! ' whispered Frodo. `I thought I heard voices.' 
line 33833=>     The  two  hobbits  trussed their  small packs,  put  them  on ready for  
line 33834=>flight,  and  then  crawled  deeper  into  the  fern.  There  they  crouched 
line 33835=>listening. 
line 33836=>     There was no doubt of the voices. They were speaking low and furtively,  
line 33837=>but they were near, and coming nearer. Then quite suddenly one spoke clearly 
line 33838=>close at hand. 
line 33839=>     `Here! Here is where the smoke came from! ' it said. `'Twill be nigh at 
line 33840=>hand. In the fern, no  doubt. We shall have it like  a coney in a trap. Then 
line 33841=>we shall learn what kind of thing it is.' 
line 33842=>     `Aye, and what it knows! ' said a second voice. 
line 33843=>     At  once  four  men  came  striding  through  the  fern from  different 
line 33844=>directions. Since flight and hiding  were no longer  possible, Frodo and Sam 
line 33845=>sprang  to their  feet,  putting  back to back and whipping out  their small 
line 33846=>swords. 
line 33847=>     If they were astonished at what they saw, their captors were even  more 
line 33848=>astonished.  Four tall Men  stood there. Two  had spears in their hands with 
line 33849=>broad  bright heads. Two  had great bows,  almost of their  own height,  and  
line 33850=>great quivers of long green-feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides,  
line 33851=>and were clad in green  and  brown of varied hues, as if the better  to walk  
line 33852=>unseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green  gauntlets covered  their hands, and 
line 33853=>their faces were hooded and  masked with green, except for their eyes, which 
line 33854=>were very keen and bright. At once  Frodo thought of  Boromir, for these Men 
line 33855=>were like him in stature and bearing, a nd in their manner of speech. 
line 33856=>     `We have  not found what we sought,' said one. `But what have we found? 
line 33857=>' 
line 33858=>     'Not Orcs,' said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had 
line 33859=>seized when he saw the glitter of Sting in Frodo's hand. 
line 33860=>     `Elves? ' said a third, doubtfully. 
line 33861=>     `Nay! Not Elves,'  said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the 
line 33862=>
line 33863=>####-chief among them. `Elves do not  walk in Ithilien in these  days.  And Elves  
line 33864=>are wondrous fair to look upon, or so 'tis said.' 
line 33865=>     'Meaning  we're not, I take you,' said Sam. `Thank you kindly. And when  
line 33866=>you've finished discussing us,  perhaps you'll say who you are, and  why you  
line 33867=>can't let two tired travellers rest.' 
line 33868=>     The tall  green man laughed grimly.  `I am Faramir, Captain of Gondor,' 
line 33869=>he said. `But there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the 
line 33870=>Dark Tower, or of the White.' 
line 33871=>     `But  we are  neither,' said Frodo.  `And  travellers  we are, whatever  
line 33872=>Captain Faramir may say.' 
line 33873=>     'Then make  haste to declare yourselves and your errand,' said Faramir. 
line 33874=>'We  have  a  work  to  do,  and this is  no time or place  for riddling  or  
line 33875=>parleying. Come! Where is the third of your company? ' 
line 33876=>     `The third? ' 
line 33877=>     'Yes, the skulking fellow that  we saw with his  nose in  the pool down 
line 33878=>yonder. He had an ill-favoured look. Some spying breed of Orc, I guess, or a  
line 33879=>creature of theirs. But he gave us the slip by some fox-trick.' 
line 33880=>     'I do not know where he is,' said Frodo. 'He is only a chance companion 
line 33881=>met  upon our road; and I  am  not answerable for  him. If you  come on him, 
line 33882=>spare  him. Bring him  or send him  to  us.  He is  only  a wretched gangrel 
line 33883=>creature, but I have  him under my care for a while. But as for  us,  we are 
line 33884=>Hobbits of the Shire,  far to  the North and West, beyond many rivers. Frodo 
line 33885=>son of Drogo is my name, and with  me is  Samwise son  of Hamfast, a  worthy 
line 33886=>hobbit in my  service.  We  have come  by long ways  --  out of Rivendell, or  
line 33887=>Imladris as some call  it.'  Here  Faramir started  and grew  intent. 'Seven 
line 33888=>companions we had: one we lost at Moria, the others we left  at  Parth Galen 
line 33889=>above Rauros:  two of  my kin; a  Dwarf there was also,  and an Elf, and two  
line 33890=>Men.  They were  Aragorn;  and Boromir, who said  that he came out of  Minas 
line 33891=>Tirith, a city in the South.' 
line 33892=>     'Boromir! ' all the four men exclaimed. 
line 33893=>     'Boromir son of  the Lord Denethor?' said  Faramir, and a strange stern 
line 33894=>look came into his  face. 'You came with  him? That is news indeed, if it be 
line 33895=>true. Know, little strangers, that Boromir  son of Denethor was High  Warden 
line 33896=>of  the White Tower, and our Captain-General: sorely do we miss him. Who are 
line 33897=>you then,  and  what had you  to do  with  him?  Be swift, for  the  Sun  is 
line 33898=>climbing!' 
line 33899=>     'Are the riddling words known to you that Boromir brought to Rivendell?  
line 33900=>
line 33901=>####-' Frodo replied. 
line 33902=>     Seek for the Sword that was Broken. 
line 33903=>     In Imladris it dwells. 
line 33904=>     'The words are known indeed,' said Faramir in astonishment. `It is some 
line 33905=>token of your truth that you also know them.' 
line 33906=>     `Aragorn whom I named is the bearer of the Sword that was Broken,' said 
line 33907=>Frodo. 'And we are the Halflings that the rhyme spoke of.' 
line 33908=>     `That I see,' said Faramir thoughtfully. `Or I see that it might be so. 
line 33909=>And what is Isildur's Bane? ' 
line 33910=>     `That is hidden,'  answered  Frodo. `Doubtless it will be made clear in 
line 33911=>time.' 
line 33912=>     `We must  learn more of this,' said Faramir, `and know  what brings you  
line 33913=>so far east under the shadow of yonder --,' he pointed and said no name. 'But 
line 33914=>not now. We have business in hand. You are in peril.  and you would not have 
line 33915=>gone far  by field or road this day.  There will be hard handstrokes nigh at 
line 33916=>hand ere the day is full. Then death, or swift flight bark to Anduin. I will 
line 33917=>leave two to guard you, for your  good and for mine. Wise  man trusts not to 
line 33918=>chance-meeting on the road in this land. If I return, I will speak more with 
line 33919=>you.' 
line 33920=>     'Farewell!' said Frodo, bowing low. `Think what you will, I am a friend 
line 33921=>of  all enemies of the One Enemy. We  would go with you, if we halfling folk 
line 33922=>could hope to serve  you, such doughty men and strong  as you seem, and if my 
line 33923=>errand permitted it. May the light shine on your swords!' 
line 33924=>     'The  Halflings  are  courteous  folk,  whatever  else  they  be,' said 
line 33925=>Faramir. `Farewell!' 
line 33926=>     The hobbits  sat  down  again, but  they said nothing to one another of 
line 33927=>their thoughts and doubts. Close by, just  under the dappling  shadow of the 
line 33928=>dark bay-trees, two men remained on guard. They took off their masks now and 
line 33929=>again  to cool them,  as the  day-heat grew,  and Frodo  saw that  they were 
line 33930=>goodly  men, pale-skinned, dark of hair, with  grey eyes and  faces sad  and 
line 33931=>proud. They spoke together in soft voices, at first using the Common Speech, 
line 33932=>but after the manner of older days, and then changing to another language of 
line 33933=>their own. To his amazement, as he listened Frodo   became aware that  it was 
line 33934=>the Elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he looked 
line 33935=>at  them with wonder, for he  knew  then that  they must be D®nedain  of the 
line 33936=>South, men of the line of the Lords of Westernesse. 
line 33937=>     After a  while  he spoke to  them; but they were slow  and  cautious in 
line 33938=>
line 33939=>####-answering. They named themselves Mablung and Damrod, soldiers of Gondor, 
line 33940=>and 
line 33941=>they were Rangers of Ithilien; for they  were descended  from folk who lived 
line 33942=>in Ithilien  at  one time, before  it  was overrun. From  such  men the Lord 
line 33943=>Denethor chose his forayers, who  crossed the Anduin secretly (how or where, 
line 33944=>they would not say) to harry  the Orcs and other enemies that roamed between 
line 33945=>the Ephel D®ath and the River. 
line 33946=>     `It  is close on  ten leagues hence to the east -shore of Anduin,'  said 
line 33947=>Mablung, 'and we seldom come so far afield. But we have a new errand on this 
line 33948=>journey: we come to ambush the Men of Harad. Curse them! ' 
line 33949=>     'Aye, curse the Southrons! ' said Damrod.  ` 'Tis  said that there were 
line 33950=>dealings  of  old between Gondor  and the kingdoms of the  Harad in  the Far 
line 33951=>South; though there was never friendship. In those days our bounds were away 
line 33952=>south beyond the mouths of Anduin, and Umbar, the nearest  of  their realms,  
line 33953=>acknowledged our sway. But that is long since. 'Tis many lives of  Men since 
line 33954=>any passed to or  fro between us. Now of late we have learned that the Enemy 
line 33955=>has been among them, and they are gone over to Him, or back to Him-they 
line 33956=>were 
line 33957=>ever ready to His  will -as have so many also  in the East .  I doubt not that 
line 33958=>the days of Gondor are numbered, and the  walls of Minas Tirith are  doomed, 
line 33959=>so great is His strength and malice.' 
line 33960=>     `But still we will not sit idle  and  let Him do all as He would,' said 
line 33961=>Mablung. `These cursed Southrons  come  now marching up the ancient roads 
line 33962=>to 
line 33963=>swell the hosts of  the Dark Tower.  Yea, up  the very roads  that  craft of 
line 33964=>Gondor made.  And they go  ever more heedlessly, we learn, thinking that the 
line 33965=>power of their new  master is great enough, so that the mere shadow  of  His 
line 33966=>hills  will  protect  them.  We  come  to teach  them  another lesson. Great 
line 33967=>strength of them was  reported  to us  some days ago, marching north. One of 
line 33968=>their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere noon-up on 
line 33969=>the road  above, where it passes through  the cloven way. The road may pass, 
line 33970=>but  they  shall  not! Not  while Faramir  is Captain.  He  leads now in all 
line 33971=>perilous  ventures.  But his life is charmed, or fate  spares him  for  some 
line 33972=>other end.' 
line 33973=>     Their talk  died down into a listening silence.  All  seemed  still and 
line 33974=>watchful. Sam, crouched by the edge of the fern-brake, peered  out. With his 
line 33975=>
line 33976=>####-keen hobbit-eyes  he  saw that many  more Men were about. He  could see 
line 33977=>them 
line 33978=>stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade 
line 33979=>of  grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible  in their brown and  green 
line 33980=>raiment, through  grass and  brake. All were  hooded  and  masked,  and  had 
line 33981=>gauntlets on  their hands, and  were  armed like Faramir and his companions. 
line 33982=>Before  long they had  all passed and  vanished. The sun rose till it neared 
line 33983=>the South. The shadows shrank. 
line 33984=>     `I wonder where that dratted Gollum is?  '  thought Sam, as  he crawled 
line 33985=>back into deeper shade. `He  stands  a fair chance of being spitted  for  an 
line 33986=>Orc,  or of being roasted  by the Yellow Face. But I  fancy he'll look after  
line 33987=>himself.' He lay down beside Frodo and began to doze. 
line 33988=>     He woke,  thinking that he had heard horns blowing. He sat up.  It  was 
line 33989=>now high noon.  The guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees.  
line 33990=>Suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond  mistake from  above, over the 
line 33991=>top  of  the slope. Sam thought that he heard cries and wild  shouting also, 
line 33992=>but  the sound was faint,  as  if  it came out  of some  distant  cave. Then 
line 33993=>presently the noise of  fighting broke  out  near at hand, just  above their 
line 33994=>hiding-place. He could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on steel, the 
line 33995=>clang  of sword on iron  cap, the  dull beat of blade on  shield;  men  were 
line 33996=>yelling and screaming, and one clear loud voice was calling Gondor! Gondor! 
line 33997=>     `It sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together,' said Sam 
line 33998=>to Frodo. 'They're as near as I want them now.' 
line 33999=>     But the noise grew closer. `They are  coming!' cried Damrod. `See! Some 
line 34000=>of  the Southrons have broken  from the trap  and are flying  from the road. 
line 34001=>There they go! Our men after them, and the Captain leading.' 
line 34002=>     Sam,  eager to see more, went now and joined the guards. He scrambled a 
line 34003=>little  way  up into one of  the  larger of the bay-trees. For  a  moment he 
line 34004=>caught a glimpse of swarthy men in red running  down the slope  some way off 
line 34005=>with green-clad warriors leaping after them, hewing them down  as they fled. 
line 34006=>Arrows  were thick in the air. Then suddenly straight over  the rim of their 
line 34007=>sheltering bank, a man fell, crashing through  the slender trees,  nearly on 
line 34008=>top of them. He came to  rest in the  fern a  few feet away,  face downward, 
line 34009=>green arrow-feathers  sticking from  his neck  below  a  golden collar.  His 
line 34010=>scarlet robes  were tattered, his  corslet of overlapping brazen  plates was 
line 34011=>rent and hewn, his black plaits of hair braided with gold were drenched with 
line 34012=>blood. His brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword. 
line 34013=>
line 34014=>####-     It was Sam's  first view of a battle of Men against Men, and he did not 
line 34015=>like it much. He was  glad that he could not see the dead  face. He wondered 
line 34016=>what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of 
line 34017=>heart, or what lies or threats had  led him on the long march from his home; 
line 34018=>and if  he would not really rather have stayed there in peace-all in a flash 
line 34019=>of  thought which  was  quickly driven  from his mind. For  just as  Mablung 
line 34020=>stepped towards the  fallen  body, there was a  new noise.  Great crying and 
line 34021=>shouting. Amidst it Sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting.  And  then a  
line 34022=>great thudding and bumping. like huge rams dinning on the ground. 
line 34023=>     'Ware! Ware!' cried Damrod  to his  companion. 'May the Valar turn  him 
line 34024=>aside! Mymak! Mymak!' 
line 34025=>     To his  astonishment and terror,  and lasting delight,  Sam  saw a vast  
line 34026=>shape crash out of  the trees  and come careering down the  slope. Big as  a  
line 34027=>house, much bigger than a house, it looked to him, a grey-clad moving  hill.  
line 34028=>Fear and wonder, maybe, enlarged him in the hobbit's eyes, but the  Mymak of 
line 34029=>Harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and the like of him does not walk now 
line 34030=>in Middle-earth; his kin that  live still in latter days are but memories of 
line 34031=>his girth and majesty. On  he came, straight towards  the watchers, and then 
line 34032=>swerved  aside in the nick of time,  passing only  a few yards away, rocking  
line 34033=>the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like 
line 34034=>ears  spread out, long  snout upraised like a huge serpent  about to strike. 
line 34035=>his small red eyes raging. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands 
line 34036=>of  gold and dripped with blood. His trappings of  scarlet and  gold flapped 
line 34037=>about him in wild tatters. The  ruins  of  what seemed a very war -tower  lay 
line 34038=>upon his heaving back, smashed in his furious passage thr ough the woods; and 
line 34039=>high upon  his  neck still desperately clung a  tiny  figure-the  body  of a  
line 34040=>mighty warrior, a giant among the Swertings. 
line 34041=>     On the great  beast  thundered, blundering  in blind wrath through pool 
line 34042=>and thicket. Arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about  the triple hide of 
line 34043=>his flanks. Men of  both sides  fled before him,  but  many  he overtook and 
line 34044=>crushed  to  the  ground. Soon he was lost  to  view, still  trumpeting  and 
line 34045=>stamping far away. What became of him Sam never heard: whether  he escaped 
line 34046=>to 
line 34047=>roam the wild for a time, until he perished far from his home or was trapped 
line 34048=>in some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the Great River  
line 34049=>and was swallowed up. 
line 34050=>     Sam drew a  deep breath. 'An Oliphaunt it  was!' he said. `S o there are 
line 34051=>
line 34052=>####-Oliphaunts, and I have seen one.  What a life! But no one  at home will ever  
line 34053=>believe me. Well, if that's over, I'll have a bit of sleep.' 
line 34054=>     'Sleep while you  may,' said Mablung. `But  the Captain will return, if 
line 34055=>he is unhurt; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly. We shall be pursued 
line 34056=>as soon as news of our deed reaches the Enemy, and that will not be long.' 
line 34057=>     `Go quietly when you must!' said Sam.  `No need  to disturb my sleep. I 
line 34058=>was walking all night.' 
line 34059=>     Mablung  laughed.  `I  do not  think  the Captain will leave you  here, 
line 34060=>Master Samwise,' he said. 'But you shall see.'

line 34065=>Chapter 5. The Window on the West 
line 34066=>
line 34067=> 
line 34068=> 
line 34069=>     It seemed to Sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awoke 
line 34070=>to find that it was late afternoon and Faramir had come back. He had brought 
line 34071=>many men  with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray  were now gathered 
line 34072=>on the  slope nearby, two  or  three  hundred  strong.  They sat in  a  wide 
line 34073=>semicircle,  between the  arms  of which Faramir was  seated  on the ground,  
line 34074=>while  Frodo  stood  before him.  It looked strangely  like the  trial  of a  
line 34075=>prisoner. 
line 34076=>     Sam crept out from the fern, but no one paid any  attention to him, and 
line 34077=>he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear 
line 34078=>all that wa s  going on. He  watched and listened  intently, ready to dash to 
line 34079=>his  master's  aid if needed. He  could see  Faramir's face,  which  was now 
line 34080=>unmasked:  it  was  stern  and commanding, and  a keen  wit lay  behind  his 
line 34081=>searching glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at Frodo. 
line 34082=>     Sam soon became aware that  the Captain was not satisfied  with Frodo's 
line 34083=>account of  himself at several  points:  what part  he  had  to  play in the 
line 34084=>Company  that set out from Rivendell; why he had  left Boromir; and where he 
line 34085=>was now going. In particular he returned often to Isildur's Bane. Plainly he 
line 34086=>saw that Frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance. 
line 34087=>     'But  it  was at the coming of the Halfling  that Isildur's Bane should 
line 34088=>waken,  or so  one must  read the words,' he  insisted. `If then you are the 
line 34089=>Halfling that was  named,  doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may 
line 34090=>be, to the Council of which you speak, and there Boromir saw it. Do you deny 
line 34091=>it?  ' 
line 34092=>     Frodo made no answer. 'So! ' said Faramir. `I  wish then  to learn from 
line 34093=>you more of it; for  what  concerns Boromir concerns  me. An orc-arrow  slew 
line 34094=>Isildur, so far as old tales tell. But orc-arrows are plenty,  and the sight 
line 34095=>of one would not be taken as a  sign of Doom by Boromir of  Gondor.  Had you  
line 34096=>this thing  in keeping?  It is hidden, you say;  but is not that because you  
line 34097=>choose to hide it? ' 
line 34098=>     'No, not because I choose,' answered Frodo. `It  does not belong to me. 
line 34099=>It does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any  could claim 
line 34100=>it, it would  be Aragorn son  of Arathorn, whom  I named, the  leader of our 
line 34101=>Company from Moria to Rauros.' 
line 34102=>
line 34103=>####-     'Why so, and not  Boromir, prince of the City that the  sons of Elendil 
line 34104=>founded?  ' 
line 34105=>     'Because Aragorn is descended in direct lineage, father to father, from 
line 34106=>Isildur  Elendil's son  himself. And the sword  that he  bears was Elendil's 
line 34107=>sword.' 
line 34108=>     A  murmur of  astonishment ran through all the ring  of men. Some cried  
line 34109=>aloud: 'The sword of Elendil! The  sword  of Elendil comes  to Minas Tirith!  
line 34110=>Great tidings! ' But Faramir's face was unmoved. 
line 34111=>     `Maybe,' he said. `But so great a claim will need to be established and 
line 34112=>clear proofs  will  be  required,  should this  Aragorn ever  come  to Minas 
line 34113=>Tirith. He  had not come,  nor any of your  Company, when I set out six days 
line 34114=>ago.' 
line 34115=>     'Boromir was satisfied of that claim,' said Frodo. `Indeed, if  Boromir 
line 34116=>were here, he would answer all your  questions. And since  he was already at 
line 34117=>Rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you  
line 34118=>return, you may  soon learn the  answers  there. My part in the  Company was 
line 34119=>known to him, as  to all the others. for it was appointed to me by Elrond of 
line 34120=>Imladris  himself before the  whole Council. On that errand I came into this 
line 34121=>country, but it is not mine to reveal to any  outside the Company. Yet those 
line 34122=>who claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.' 
line 34123=>     Frodo's tone was  proud, whatever he felt, and Sam approved of it;  but 
line 34124=>it did not appease Faramir. 
line 34125=>     `So!' he said. `You bid me mind my own  affairs,  and get me back home,  
line 34126=>and let  you be.  Boromir  will tell all, when he comes. When he comes,  say 
line 34127=>you! Were you a friend of Boromir?' 
line 34128=>     Vividly before Frodo's  mind came the memory  of Boromir's assault upon 
line 34129=>him, and for a moment he hesitated. Faramir's eyes watching him grew harder. 
line 34130=>'Boromir was a valiant member of our Company ' said Frodo at length. 'Yes, I 
line 34131=>was his friend, for my part.' 
line 34132=>     Faramir smiled grimly. `Then you would grieve to learn that  Boromir is 
line 34133=>dead?  ' 
line 34134=>     'I  would  grieve  indeed,'  said  Frodo.  Then catching  the  look  in 
line 34135=>Faramir's eyes, he faltered. 'Dead?'  he said. `Do you mean that he is dead, 
line 34136=>and that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with 
line 34137=>me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?' 
line 34138=>     `I would not snare even an orc with a falsehood,' said Faramir. 
line 34139=>     `How then did  he die, and how do  you know of  it? Since  you say that 
line 34140=>
line 34141=>####-none of the Company had reached the city when you left.' 
line 34142=>     'As to the  manner  of  his death, I  had  hoped that  his  friend  and 
line 34143=>companion would tell me how it was.' 
line 34144=>     `But he was alive and strong when we parted. And he lives still for all 
line 34145=>that I know. Though surely there are many perils in the world.' 
line 34146=>     `Many indeed,' said Faramir, `and treachery not the least.' 
line 34147=>     Sam  had  been  getting more  and  more  impatient  and  angry at  this 
line 34148=>conversation. These last words were  more  than he  could bear, and bursting  
line 34149=>into the middle of the ring, he strode up to his master's side. 
line 34150=>     'Begging  your pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he  said, `but this has gone on long 
line 34151=>enough. He's no right to talk to you so.  After all you've gone  through, as 
line 34152=>much for his good and all these great Men as for anyone else. 
line 34153=>     'See here,  Captain! ' He  planted himself squarely in front of Faramir 
line 34154=>his  hands  on his hips,  and a look on his  face as  if he was addressing a  
line 34155=>young  hobbit who  had offered him what  he  called `sauce'  when questioned 
line 34156=>about  visits to the orchard. There was some  murmuring, but also some grins 
line 34157=>on the faces  of the men looking on: the  sight of  their Captain sitting on 
line 34158=>the ground  and  eye to eye with  a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling 
line 34159=>with wrath, was one beyond their experience. `See here! ' he said. `What are 
line 34160=>you driving at? Let's come to  the point before all the Orcs of  Mordor come 
line 34161=>down on us! If  you think my master murdered this Boromir and then ran away, 
line 34162=>you've got no sense; but say it, and have done!  And then  let us  know what 
line 34163=>you mean to do  about it. But it's a pity that folk as talk  about  fighting 
line 34164=>the  Enemy  can't  let  others  do  their  bit  in  their  own  way  without 
line 34165=>interfering. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got  
line 34166=>a new friend, he would.' 
line 34167=>     `Patience!' said Faramir, but without anger.  `Do not speak before your 
line 34168=>master, whose wit is  greater than yours. And I do not need any to teach  me 
line 34169=>of our peril. Even  so, I  spare a brief time, in order to judge justly in a  
line 34170=>hard matter. Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you long ago.  For I 
line 34171=>am commanded  to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of  the 
line 34172=>Lord of Gondor.  But I do not slay man  or beast needlessly, and  not gladly 
line 34173=>even when it is needed. Neither do  I talk  in vain. So be comforted. Sit by 
line 34174=>your master, and be silent! ' 
line 34175=>     Sam  sat down heavily with a red face.  Faramir turned to Frodo  again: 
line 34176=>'You asked how do I know that the son of Denethor is dead. Tidings of  death 
line 34177=>have many wings.  Night oft brings news to  near kindred, 'tis said. Boromir  
line 34178=>
line 34179=>####-was my brother.' 
line 34180=>     A  shadow  of sorrow passed  over his face.  `Do you remember  aught of  
line 34181=>special mark that the Lord Boromir bore with him among his gear?' 
line 34182=>     Frodo  thought for a moment,  fearing some further trap, and  wondering  
line 34183=>how this debate would turn in the end. He had hardly saved the Ring from the 
line 34184=>proud grasp of Boromir, and how he would fare now among so many men, 
line 34185=>warlike 
line 34186=>and  strong, he did not know.  Yet he felt in his heart that Faramir, though 
line 34187=>he was much like his brother  in  looks, was a man less self-regarding, both 
line 34188=>sterner and wiser. 'I remember that Boromir bore a horn,' he said at last. 
line 34189=>     `You remember  well, and  as  one  who has  in  truth  seen  him,' said 
line 34190=>Faramir. `Then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye: a great horn  of the  
line 34191=>wild ox of the East, bound with silver, and written with ancient characters. 
line 34192=>That horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it  
line 34193=>is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of Gondor, as 
line 34194=>the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded. 
line 34195=>     'Five days ere I set out on this venture, eleven days ago at about this 
line 34196=>hour of  the  day, I heard  the blowing of that horn: from the northward  it 
line 34197=>seemed, but  dim, as if  it were but an echo in the mind. A boding of ill we 
line 34198=>thought it, my father and I, for no tidings had we heard of Boromir since he 
line 34199=>went away, and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass. And on the third 
line 34200=>night after another and a stranger thing befell me. 
line 34201=>     'I sat at night by  the waters of Anduin,  in the grey dark  under  the 
line 34202=>young pale moon, watching the ever -moving  stream;  and the  sad  reeds were 
line 34203=>rustling. So do we  ever watch the shores  nigh Osgiliath, which our enemies 
line 34204=>now partly hold,  and issue from it to harry our lands. Bu t  that night  all 
line 34205=>the world slept at the midnight hour. Then I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a  
line 34206=>boat floating  on  the water, glimmering  grey,  a small  boat  of a strange 
line 34207=>fashion with a high prow. and there was none to row or steer it. 
line 34208=>     `An awe fell on me, for  a pale light was round it. But I rose and went 
line 34209=>to the bank, and began to walk out into the stream,  for I was drawn towards 
line 34210=>it. Then the boat turned towards me, and stayed its pace, and floated slowly 
line 34211=>by  within my hand's reach, yet I durst not handle it. It waded  deep, as if 
line 34212=>it were heavily burdened,  and it  seemed to me  as it passed under  my gaze 
line 34213=>that it was  almost filled with clear water, from which came the light;  and 
line 34214=>lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep. 
line 34215=>     `A broken  sword  was on his knee. I saw  many wounds on  him.  It  was 
line 34216=>
line 34217=>####-Boromir, my brother, dead. I knew his gear, his sword, his beloved face. One 
line 34218=>thing only I missed: his horn. One thing only I knew not: a fair belt, as it 
line 34219=>were  of linked golden leaves, about his waist. Boromir!  I cried.  Where is 
line 34220=>thy  horn? Whither  goest  thou? O Boromir! But he was gone. The boat turned 
line 34221=>into the stream and passed  glimmering on into the night. Dreamlike  it was.  
line 34222=>and yet no dream, for there  was  no waking. And I do  not  doubt that he is 
line 34223=>dead and has passed down the River to the Sea.' 
line 34224=>     'Alas!' said  Frodo. 'That was indeed Boromir as I  knew  him. For  the 
line 34225=>golden belt was given to him in Lothlurien by the Lady Galadriel. She it was 
line 34226=>that clothed us as  you see  us, in elven-grey. This   brooch is of  the same 
line 34227=>workmanship.' He touched the green and silver leaf that  fastened  his cloak 
line 34228=>beneath his throat. 
line 34229=>     Faramir looked  closely at it.  `It is beautiful,' he  said. 'Yes, 'tis 
line 34230=>work of  the same  craft. So  then  you passed through the Land  of  Lurien?  
line 34231=>Laurelindurenan  it  was named of  old, but long now it  has lain beyond the  
line 34232=>knowledge of Men,' he added softly, regarding Frodo with a new wonder in his 
line 34233=>eyes. `Much  that was strange about you  I begin now to understand. Will you 
line 34234=>not tell me more? For it is a bitter thought that Boromir died, within sight 
line 34235=>of the land of his home.' 
line 34236=>     'No more can I say than I have said,' answered Frodo. `Though your tale 
line 34237=>fills me with foreboding. A  vision it was that  you saw, I  think,  and  no 
line 34238=>more, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be. Unless indeed it  
line 34239=>is some lying trick of the Enemy. I have  seen the faces of fair warriors of 
line 34240=>old laid in  sleep beneath the  pools of the Dead Marshes, or seeming so  by 
line 34241=>his foul arts.' 
line 34242=>     'Nay, it was not so,' said Faramir.  'For his works  fill the heart with 
line 34243=>loathing; but my heart was filled with grief and pity.' 
line 34244=>     `Yet how could such a thing have happened in truth? ' asked Frodo. 'For  
line 34245=>no boat could have been carried  over the stony hills from  Tol Brandir; and 
line 34246=>Boromir purposed to  go home across the Entwash and the fields of Rohan. 
line 34247=>And 
line 34248=>yet how could any vessel ride the foam of the great falls and not founder in 
line 34249=>the boiling pools, though laden with water? ' 
line 34250=>     'I know not,' said Faramir. 'But whence came the boat? ' 
line 34251=>     `From Lurien,' said Frodo. 'In three such boats we rowed down Anduin to 
line 34252=>the Falls. They also were of elven-work.' 
line 34253=>     'You passed through the Hidden Land,' said  Faramir, `but it seems that 
line 34254=>
line 34255=>####-you little  understood its power. If  Men have dealings with the Mistress of 
line 34256=>Magic who dwells in the Golden  Wood, then they may look for  strange things 
line 34257=>to follow. For it  is perilous  for mortal man  to walk  out of the world of 
line 34258=>this Sun, and few of old came thence unchanged, 'tis said. 
line 34259=>     `Boromir, O Boromir!' he cried. `What did she say to you, the Lady that 
line 34260=>dies not? What did she see? What woke in your heart then? Why went you  ever 
line 34261=>to Laurelindurenan, and came not by your own road,  upon the horses of 
line 34262=>Rohan 
line 34263=>riding home in the morning? ' 
line 34264=>     Then turning again to  Frodo, he spoke in a quiet voice  once more. 'To 
line 34265=>those questions I guess that you could make some answer, Frodo son of Drogo. 
line 34266=>But  not  here  or now.  maybe. But lest you  still should  think my  tale a  
line 34267=>vision, I  will tell  you this.  The horn of Boromir at  least  returned  in 
line 34268=>truth, and not in seeming. The horn came,  but it was  cloven  in two, as it 
line 34269=>were  by axe or  sword. The shards  came severally to  shore: one was  found 
line 34270=>among the reeds where watchers of  Gondor lay,  northwards below the infalls 
line 34271=>of the Entwash;  the other was found spinning on the flood by one who had an 
line 34272=>errand in the water. Strange chances, but murder will out, 'tis said. 
line 34273=>     'And now the horn of the elder  son lies in two pieces upon the lap  of 
line 34274=>Denethor,  sitting in his high chair, waiting for news. And you  can tell me 
line 34275=>nothing of the cleaving of the horn? ' 
line 34276=>     'No, I did not know of it,' said Frodo. `But the day when you  heard it 
line 34277=>blowing, if your reckoning is true, was  the day when we parted, when  I and  
line 34278=>my servant left the Company.  And now your  tale fills me with dread. For if 
line 34279=>Boromir was then in peril and was slain, I  must fear that all my companions 
line 34280=>perished too. And they were my kindred and my friends. 
line 34281=>     `Will you not put aside your dou bt of me and let me go? I am weary, and 
line 34282=>full of grief, and  afraid. But I have a deed to do, or to attempt, before I 
line 34283=>too am slain. And the more need of haste, if  we two halflings are  all that 
line 34284=>remain of our fellowship. 
line 34285=>     'Go back, Faramir,  valiant Captain of  Gondor,  and  defend  your city 
line 34286=>while you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.' 
line 34287=>     `For me there is no comfort in our speech together,' said Faramir; `but 
line 34288=>you surely draw from it more dread than need be. Unless the people of Lurien 
line 34289=>themselves came  to him,  who arrayed Boromir  as for a funeral? Not Orcs or  
line 34290=>servants of the Nameless. Some of your Company, I guess, live still. 
line 34291=>     `But whatever befell on the North March, you, Frodo, I doubt no longer. 
line 34292=>
line 34293=>####-If  hard days  have made  me  any judge of Men's words and faces, then I may 
line 34294=>make a guess at Halflings! Though,' and  now he  smiled, `there is something 
line 34295=>strange about you, Frodo, an elvish air, maybe. But more lies upon our words 
line 34296=>together than I thought at first. I should now take you back to Minas Tirith 
line 34297=>to answer  there to Denethor, and my  life will justly be forfeit, if  I now 
line 34298=>choose a course that  proves ill for my city. So I will not  decide in haste 
line 34299=>what is to be done. Yet we must move hence without more delay.' 
line 34300=>     He  sprang to his feet and issued some orders. At once the men who were 
line 34301=>gathered round  him broke up into small  groups, and went off  this way  and  
line 34302=>that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the  rocks and  trees. Soon only 
line 34303=>Mablung and Damrod remained. 
line 34304=>     'Now you,  Frodo  and Samwise, will come  with me  and my guards,' said 
line 34305=>Faramir. `You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. 
line 34306=>It will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after  this 
line 34307=>affray than it has been yet. And  you cannot,  I  think, go far today in any 
line 34308=>case, for you are weary. And so are we.  We are going  now to a secret place  
line 34309=>we  have, somewhat less than ten  miles from here. The Orcs and spies of the 
line 34310=>Enemy have not found  it yet, and if they did, we  could  hold  it long even 
line 34311=>against many. There we may lie up and rest for  a while, and you with us. In 
line 34312=>the morning I will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.' 
line 34313=>     There was nothing for Frodo to do but to  fall in with this request, or  
line 34314=>order. It seemed in any case a  wise course for the moment, since this  foray 
line 34315=>of the men  of  Gondor had made a  journey  in Ithilien more  dangerous than 
line 34316=>ever. 
line 34317=>     They set out  at once: Mablung and  Damrod  a little ahead, and Faramir 
line 34318=>with Frodo  and Sam  behind.  Skirting the hither  side of the pool where the 
line 34319=>hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed 
line 34320=>into  green-shadowed woodlands that marched  ever downwards  and  
line 34321=>westwards.  
line 34322=>While they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed 
line 34323=>voices. 
line 34324=>     'I broke off our speech together,' said Faramir, 'not only because time 
line 34325=>pressed, as Master Samwise had reminded me, but also because we were 
line 34326=>drawing 
line 34327=>near to matters that were better not debated openly  before many men. It was 
line 34328=>for that  reason that I turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be 
line 34329=>Isildur's Bane. You were not wholly frank with me, Frodo.' 
line 34330=>
line 34331=>####-     `I told no lies, and of the truth all I could,' said Frodo. 
line 34332=>     `I do  not blame you,'  said Faramir. 'You spoke  with skill  in  a hard 
line 34333=>place, and wisely,  it seemed to me. But I learned or  guessed more from you  
line 34334=>than your words said. You  were  not friendly with Boromir, or  you  did not  
line 34335=>part  in  friendship.  You, and  Master  Samwise,  too,  I  guess have  some 
line 34336=>grievance. Now I  loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet I 
line 34337=>knew  him well. Isildur's  Bane  -- I would hazard that  Isildur's Bane  lay 
line 34338=>between you and was a cause of contention in  your Company. Clearly it is  a 
line 34339=>mighty  heirloom  of some sort,  and such  things do not  breed  peace among 
line 34340=>confederates, not if aught may be  learned from  ancient tales. Do I not hit 
line 34341=>near the mark?' 
line 34342=>     `Near,' said Frodo,  'but  not in the gold.  There was no contention in 
line 34343=>our Company, though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from 
line 34344=>the 
line 34345=>Emyn  Muil. But be that as it may, ancient  tales teach us also the peril of 
line 34346=>rash words concerning such things as  -- heirlooms.' 
line 34347=>     'Ah,  then it is as I  thought: your trouble was with Boromir alone. He 
line 34348=>wished this  thing  brou ght to Minas Tirith. Alas! it is a crooked fate that 
line 34349=>seals  your lips who saw him  last, and holds from me that  which I  long to 
line 34350=>know: what  was  in his  heart and  thought  in his latest hours. Whether he 
line 34351=>erred or no, of this I am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. His 
line 34352=>face was more beautiful even than in life. 
line 34353=>     `But, Frodo, I pressed you hard at first about Isildur's  Bane. Forgive 
line 34354=>me! It was unwise in such an hour and place. I had not had time for thought. 
line 34355=>We had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough to fill my mind. But 
line 34356=>even as  I spoke  with you, I drew  nearer to the mark, and so  deliberately 
line 34357=>shot wider.  For you must know that much is still preserved  of ancient lore 
line 34358=>among the Rulers of the city  that is not spread abroad. We of  my house are 
line 34359=>not  of the line  of  Elendil.  though the blood of N®menor is in us. For we 
line 34360=>reckon back our line  to  Mardil,  the good steward, who ruled in the king's 
line 34361=>stead when he went away to war. And  that was King Edrnur, last  of the line 
line 34362=>of Anbrion, and  childless, and  he  came never back. And the stewards  have 
line 34363=>governed the city since that day, though it was many generations of Men ago. 
line 34364=>     'And this I remember of Boromir as a boy,  when we together learned the 
line 34365=>tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him 
line 34366=>that his father was not king. "How many hundreds of years needs it to make a 
line 34367=>steward a king, if the king  returns not? " he asked. "Few years, maybe,  in 
line 34368=>
line 34369=>####-other places of less  royalty," my father  answered. "In Gondor ten thousand  
line 34370=>years  would not  suffice."  Alas!  poor Boromir. Does  that  not  tell  you  
line 34371=>something of him?  ' 
line 34372=>     'It does,' said Frodo. `Yet always he treated Aragorn with honour.' 
line 34373=>     'I doubt it  not,' said  Faramir. `If he  were satisfied  of  Aragorn's 
line 34374=>claim  as you say, he would greatly reverence him. But the pinch has not yet 
line 34375=>come. They had not yet reached Minas Tirith or become rivals in her wars.  
line 34376=>     `But I  stray. We in  the house of Denethor  know much  ancient lore by 
line 34377=>long  tradition,  and  there  are  moreover in  our  treasuries many  things 
line 34378=>preserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments, yea, and on stone, 
line 34379=>and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers characters. Some none can now 
line 34380=>read; and for the rest,  few ever unlock them. I can  read a little in them, 
line 34381=>for I have had teaching. It was these  records that brought the Grey Pilgrim 
line 34382=>to  us. I first saw him when I was a child,  and he has been twice or thrice 
line 34383=>since then.' 
line 34384=>     'The Grey Pilgrim? ' said Frodo. 'Had he a name?' 
line 34385=>     'Mithrandir we  called  him in  elf-fashion,' said Faramir,  'and he was 
line 34386=>content. Many are my names in many countries,  he said. Mithrandir among the 
line 34387=>Elves, Tharkyn to the  Dwarves; Olurin I was in my youth in the West that is  
line 34388=>forgotten, in  the  South Incbnus, in  the North Gandalf;  to the East  I go 
line 34389=>not.' 
line 34390=>     'Gandalf!' said Frodo. 'I thought it was he.  Gandalf  the Grey dearest 
line 34391=>of counsellors. Leader of our Company. He was lost in Moria.' 
line 34392=>     'Mithrandir  was  lost!  '  said Faramir.  'An  evil fate seems to have 
line 34393=>pursued your fellowship. It is hard indeed to believe that one  of so  great 
line 34394=>wisdom, and of  power -- for many wonderful things he  did among us  -- could 
line 34395=>perish, and so much lore be taken from the world. Are you sure of  this, and  
line 34396=>that he did not just leave you and depart where he would? ' 
line 34397=>     'Alas! yes,' said Frodo. `I saw him fall into the abyss.' 
line 34398=>     'I see that there  is some great tale of dread in  this.' said  Faramir 
line 34399=>`which perhaps  you may  tell me in the evening-time. This Mithrandir was, I 
line 34400=>now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are done 
line 34401=>in our  time. Had he been  among us to  consult concerning the hard words of 
line 34402=>our  dream, he could have  made them clear to  us without need of messenger. 
line 34403=>Yet, maybe,  he would  not  have done  so,  and  the journey of Boromir  was 
line 34404=>doomed.  Mithrandir never spoke to us  of what was to  be, nor did he reveal 
line 34405=>his purposes. He got leave of Denethor, how I  do  not  know, to look at the 
line 34406=>
line 34407=>####-secrets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would  teach 
line 34408=>(and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would  question us above all 
line 34409=>else  concerning  the  Great  Battle  that was fought  upon Dagorlad  in the 
line 34410=>beginning of Gondor, when He whom we do not name was over thrown.  And 
line 34411=>he was 
line 34412=>eager for stories of Isildur, though of him we had less to tell; for nothing 
line 34413=>certain was ever known among us of his end.' 
line 34414=>     Now Faramir's voice  sank  to  a whisper. 'But  this much  I learned or  
line 34415=>guessed, and I have kept it ever secr et in my heart since: that Isildur took  
line 34416=>somewhat from the hand of the Unnamed, ere he  went away  from Gondor, 
line 34417=>never 
line 34418=>to be  seen among  mortal  men  again. Here  I  thought  was  the answer  to 
line 34419=>Mithrandir's questioning. But  it seemed then a  matter that concerned  only 
line 34420=>the seekers after ancient learning. Nor when the riddling words of our dream 
line 34421=>were  debated  among us,  did I think of Isildur's  Bane as being  this same 
line 34422=>thing. For Isildur was ambushed and  slain by  orc-arrows, according  to the  
line 34423=>only legend that we knew, and Mithrandir had never told me more. 
line 34424=>     `What in truth  this Thing is I cannot yet guess; but some heirloom  of 
line 34425=>power and peril it must be.  A  fell weapon, perchance, devised by  the Dark  
line 34426=>Lord. If it were  a thing that gave advantage in battle. I can  well believe 
line 34427=>that  Boromir,  the  proud  and fearless,  often rash, ever anxious for  the 
line 34428=>victory of  Minas  Tirith (and  his own glory therein), might desire  such a  
line 34429=>thing and be allured by  it. Alas that ever he went on that errand! I should 
line 34430=>have been chosen by my  father and the elders but he put himself forward. as 
line 34431=>being the older and the hardier (both true), and he would not be stayed. 
line 34432=>     'But  fear no more!  I would not take  this  thing,  if it  lay by  the 
line 34433=>highway. Not were Minas Tirith  falling in ruin and  I alone could save her, 
line 34434=>so, using the  weapon of the Dark Lord for her  good and my glory.  No. I do 
line 34435=>not wish for such triumphs, Frodo son of Drogo.' 
line 34436=>     'Neither did the Council,' said Frodo. 'Nor do  I. I would have nothing 
line 34437=>to do with such matters.' 
line 34438=>     `For myself,' said Faramir, 'I would see the White Tree in flower again 
line 34439=>in the courts of the kings, and the Silver Crown return, and Minas Tirith in 
line 34440=>peace:  Minas  Anor again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful 
line 34441=>as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many  slaves, nay, not even 
line 34442=>a kind mistress of willing slaves.  War  must  be, while we defend our lives 
line 34443=>against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword 
line 34444=>
line 34445=>####-for its sharpness, nor the arrow for  its swiftness, nor the warrior for his 
line 34446=>glory. I love only that which they defend: the city of the Men  of  N®menor;  
line 34447=>and I would have  her loved for her memory,  her ancientry, her  beauty, and  
line 34448=>her present wisdom. Not feared, save  as men may fear the  dignity of a man, 
line 34449=>old and wise. 
line 34450=>     'So  fear me not! I do not ask you to tell me  more.  I do not even ask  
line 34451=>you to tell me  whether I now speak nearer the  mark. But if you  will trust  
line 34452=>me,  it may  be that I can advise  you in your present  quest, whatever that 
line 34453=>be-yes, and even aid you.' 
line 34454=>     Frodo made no  answer. Almost he  yielded to  the  desire for  help and 
line 34455=>counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words  seemed so wise and fair, 
line 34456=>all that was in his mind. But something  held him back. His heart  was heavy  
line 34457=>with fear and sorrow: if he and Sam  were indeed, as seemed likely, all that 
line 34458=>was now left of the Nine Walkers, then he was  in sole command of the secret 
line 34459=>of their errand. Better mistrust undeserved  than rash words. And the memory 
line 34460=>of Bor omir, of the dreadful change that the  lure of the Ring had  worked in 
line 34461=>him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at Faramir and listened to 
line 34462=>his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin. 
line 34463=>     They walked on in  silence for a  while,  passing  like grey and  green 
line 34464=>shadows under  the old trees,  their feet  making no  sound; above them many 
line 34465=>birds sang, and the sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in the 
line 34466=>evergreen woods of Ithilien. 
line 34467=>     Sam had taken no part in  the conversation, though he had listened; and 
line 34468=>at the same time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to  all  the soft  
line 34469=>woodland noises about them. One thing he had noted, that in all the talk the 
line 34470=>name of Gollum had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was 
line 34471=>too much to hope that he would never  hear  it again. He soon  became  aware 
line 34472=>also that though they  walked alone, there  were many men close at hand: not 
line 34473=>only Damrod and Mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others 
line 34474=>on either side, all making their swift secret way to some appointed place. 
line 34475=>     Once,  looking suddenly back,  as if some prickle of the skin told  him 
line 34476=>that he  was watched from behind, he  thought he caught a brief glimpse of a  
line 34477=>small dark shape slipping behind a  tree-trunk. He opened his mouth to speak 
line 34478=>and shut it again. `I'm not sure of it,' he said to himself, 'and why should 
line 34479=>I remind them of the old villain, if  they choose to  forget  him? I wish  I 
line 34480=>could!' 
line 34481=>     So they passed on,  until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began 
line 34482=>
line 34483=>####-to fall more steeply.  Then they turned aside again, to the right,  and came 
line 34484=>quickly  to a  small river in a narrow  gorge:  it was the  same stream that 
line 34485=>trickled  far  above out of  the round pool, now grown  to  a swift torrent, 
line 34486=>leaping down over many stones in a deep-cloven bed,  overhung  with ilex and 
line 34487=>dark box-woods. Looking west they could see,  below them in a haze of light, 
line 34488=>lowlands and broad meads, and glinting far off in the westering sun the wide  
line 34489=>waters of the Anduin. 
line 34490=>     'Here, alas! I must do you  a discourtesy,' said  Faramir.  "I hope you  
line 34491=>will pardon it to one who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as 
line 34492=>not  to  slay you or to bind  you. But it is a command that no stranger, not 
line 34493=>even one of Rohan that fights  with  us, sha ll  see the path we now  go with 
line 34494=>open eyes. I must blindfold you.' 
line 34495=>     `As you will,' said  Frodo. 'Even the Elves  do  likewise  at need, and 
line 34496=>blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair Lothlurien. Gimli  the dwarf took  
line 34497=>it ill, but the hobbits endured it.' 
line 34498=>     `It is to no place so fair that I shall lead you,' said Faramir. 'But I 
line 34499=>am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.' 
line 34500=>     He called softly  and immediately Mablung and Damrod stepped out of the 
line 34501=>trees  and  came  back  to  him.  'Blindfold  these guests,'  said  Faramir. 
line 34502=>`Securely, but not so as to discomfort  them. Do not  tie  their hands. They 
line 34503=>will  give their word not to try and see.  I  could trust them to shut their 
line 34504=>eyes of their  own accord, but  eyes will blink, if  the  feet stumble. Lead 
line 34505=>them so that they do not falter.' 
line 34506=>     With green scarves the  two guards  now bound up the hobbits'  eyes and 
line 34507=>drew their hoods down almost  to their mouths; then  quickly  they took each 
line 34508=>one by  the hand and went on their way. All that Frodo and Sam knew of  this 
line 34509=>last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little 
line 34510=>they found that  they were  on a  path descending  steeply; soon  it grew so 
line 34511=>narrow that they went in  single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; 
line 34512=>their  guards steered them  from  behind with  hands  laid  firmly on  their 
line 34513=>shoulders. Now and again they came  to  rough  places  and were  lifted from 
line 34514=>their feet for a  while,  and then  set down again. Always  the noise of the 
line 34515=>running water  was  on their right hand, and it grew  nearer and louder.  At 
line 34516=>length  they  were  halted.  Quickly Mablung and  Damrod turned them  about, 
line 34517=>several times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed  upwards a  
line 34518=>little: it seemed cold and the noise  of the stream had become  faint.  Then 
line 34519=>they were picked up  and carried down, down many steps, and round a  corner. 
line 34520=>
line 34521=>####-Suddenly they heard  the water again, loud now,  rushing and  splashing. All 
line 34522=>round them it seemed, and  they felt a fine rain  on their hands and cheeks. 
line 34523=>At last they were set on their  feet once  more. For a moment they stood so, 
line 34524=>half fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no one spoke. 
line 34525=>     Then came the voice of Faramir close behind. `Let  them see! ' he said. 
line 34526=>The scarves  were  removed and  their hoods drawn back, and they blinked and 
line 34527=>gasped. 
line 34528=>     They stood on a wet floor of polished  stone, the doorstep, as it were, 
line 34529=>of a rough-hewn gate of rock opening dark behind them. But  in  front a thin 
line 34530=>veil  of water was hung, so  near that Frodo cou ld  have put an outstretched 
line 34531=>arm into it. It  faced westward. The level shafts  of the setting sun behind 
line 34532=>beat  upon it, and the red  light was broken  into many flickering  beams of 
line 34533=>ever -changing  colour. It  was as if  they  stood  at  the  window  of  some 
line 34534=>elven-tower, curtained with threaded  jewels  of silver and  gold, and ruby, 
line 34535=>sapphire and amethyst, all kindled with an unconsuming fire. 
line 34536=>     'At least by good chance we  came at the  right hour  to reward you for  
line 34537=>your patience,' said Faramir.  `This is the  Window  of the Sunset,  Henneth 
line 34538=>Annyn,  fairest  of all the falls of Ithilien, land  of  many fountains. Few 
line 34539=>strangers have ever seen it. But there is no kingly hall behind to match it. 
line 34540=>Enter now and see! ' 
line 34541=>     Even as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water.  
line 34542=>They  turned and passed under  the low forbidding  arch. At  once they found 
line 34543=>themselves in a rock -chamber, wide and rough, with an  uneven stooping roof.  
line 34544=>A  few torches were kindled  and cast a dim  light on the  glisten ing walls.  
line 34545=>Many men were already there. Others were  still coming in by twos and threes 
line 34546=>through a dark narrow door on one side. As their eyes grew accustomed to the 
line 34547=>gloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was 
line 34548=>filled with gr eat store of arms and victuals.  
line 34549=>     'Well, here is  our refuge,'  said Faramir. `Not a place of  great ease 
line 34550=>but here you may pass  the night in peace. It is dry at least,  and there is 
line 34551=>food, though no fire. At one  time the water flowed  down  through this cave 
line 34552=>and out  of the  arch, but its  course was changed further  up the gorge, by 
line 34553=>workmen  of old, and the stream sent down in a fall  of  doubled height over  
line 34554=>the rocks  far above.  All the ways  into this grot were then sealed against  
line 34555=>the entry of water   or aught else, all save one. There are now but  two ways 
line 34556=>out:  that passage yonder by which you entered  blindfold,  and  through the  
line 34557=>Window-curtain into  a deep  bowl  filled  with knives of  stone. Now rest a  
line 34558=>
line 34559=>####-while, until the evening meal is set.' 
line 34560=>     The hobbits  were taken to a corner and given a  low bed to lie on,  if 
line 34561=>they wished. Meanwhile  men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in 
line 34562=>orderly  quickness. Light  tables  were taken from the walls and  set  up on 
line 34563=>trestles and laden  with gear .  This was plain and unadorned  for  the  most 
line 34564=>part,  but  all well and fairly,  made:  round platters, bowls and dishes of 
line 34565=>glazed brown clay or turned box-wood, smooth and clean. Here and there was a  
line 34566=>cup or basin of polished bronze; and a goblet of plain  silver was set by the 
line 34567=>Captain's seat in the middle of the inmost table. 
line 34568=>     Faramir went about  among the men, questioning each as he came in, in a  
line 34569=>soft  voice. Some came back from the pursuit of  the Southrons; others, left  
line 34570=>behind as scouts near the roa d, came in latest. All  the Southrons  had been 
line 34571=>accounted for, save  only the  great mymak:  what happened to him none could 
line 34572=>say. Of the enemy no movement could be seen; not even an orc-spy was 
line 34573=>abroad. 
line 34574=>     'You saw and heard nothing, Anborn?' Faramir asked of the latest comer. 
line 34575=>     `Well, no, lord,' said the man. `No Orc at least. But I saw, or thought 
line 34576=>I saw,  something a little strange. It was getting deep dusk, when the  eyes 
line 34577=>make things greater than they should be. So perhaps it may have been no more 
line 34578=>than a squirrel.' Sam pricked up  his ears at this.  'Yet if  so,  it  was a  
line 34579=>black squirrel, and I saw no tail. 'Twas like a shadow on the ground, and it 
line 34580=>whisked behind a tree-trunk when  I drew  nigh and went up aloft as swift as 
line 34581=>any squirrel could.  You wi ll not have us  slay wild  beasts for no purpose, 
line 34582=>and it  seemed  no  more, so I  tried  no arrow.  It was too  dark for  sure 
line 34583=>shooting anyway, and the creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a 
line 34584=>twinkling.  But  I stayed  for a  while, for  it seemed strange, and then  I 
line 34585=>hastened back. I  thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as  I 
line 34586=>turned away.  A large squirrel,  maybe.  Perhaps  under  the  shadow of  the 
line 34587=>Unnamed  some of the beasts of Mirkwood are  wandering hither to our  
line 34588=>woods. 
line 34589=>They have black squirrels there, 'tis said.' 
line 34590=>     `Perhaps,' said Faramir. `But that would be an ill omen, if it were so. 
line 34591=>We do  not want the  escapes of Mirkwood in Ithilien.'  Sam  fancied that he  
line 34592=>gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he  spoke; but Sam  said nothing.  
line 34593=>For a  while he and Frodo lay back and watched the torchlight, and  the  men 
line 34594=>moving  to and  fro  speaking in  hushed  voices. Then  suddenly  Frodo fell  
line 34595=>asleep. 
line 34596=>
line 34597=>####-     Sam  struggled with himself, arguing this  way and that. `He may be a ll 
line 34598=>right,' he  thought, 'and then  he  may  not.  Fair  speech may hide  a foul 
line 34599=>heart.' He yawned. `I could sleep for a week, and I'd be better  for it. And 
line 34600=>what  can  I do, if I do  keep  awake, me all alone, and all these great Men 
line 34601=>about? Nothing, Sam Gamgee; but you've got to keep awake  all the same.' And 
line 34602=>somehow he managed it. The light faded from the cave door, and the grey veil 
line 34603=>of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow. Always the sound 
line 34604=>of the water went on, never changing its note, morning or evening  or night.  
line 34605=>It murmured and whispered of sleep. Sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes. 
line 34606=>     Now more torches  were being  lit. A cask of wine was broached. Storage 
line 34607=>barrels were being opened. Men were  fetching water from the fall. Some were 
line 34608=>laving  their hands  in  basins. A  wide copper bowl and  a white cloth were 
line 34609=>brought to Faramir and he washed. 
line 34610=>     `Wake our guests,' he said, `and take them water. It is time to eat.' 
line 34611=>     Frodo sat  up and yawned and  stretched.  Sam, not used to being waited 
line 34612=>on, looked with some surprise at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin  of 
line 34613=>water before him. 
line 34614=>     'Put it on the ground, master, if you please! ' he said. 'Easier for me 
line 34615=>and you.' Then to  the astonishment and amusement of  the Men he plunged his 
line 34616=>head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears.  
line 34617=>     'Is it the custom  in  your land to wash the head before supper? ' said 
line 34618=>the man who waited on the hobbits.  
line 34619=>     `No, before  breakfast,' said Sam. `But  if  you're short of sleep cold 
line 34620=>water on the neck's like  rain  on a wilted lettuce.  There! Now  I can keep 
line 34621=>awake long enough to eat a bit.' 
line 34622=>     They were led then to seats beside Faramir: barrels  covered with pelts 
line 34623=>and high enough above the  benches of the Men  for their convenience. Before 
line 34624=>they ate,  Faramir  and all  his  men turned  and faced west in  a moment of 
line 34625=>silence. Faramir signed to Frodo and Sam that they should do likewise. 
line 34626=>     'So we always do.' he  said, as they sat down: `we look towards N®menor 
line 34627=>that  was,  and beyond to  Elvenhome that is, and  to  that which  is beyond 
line 34628=>Elvenhome and will ever be. Have you no such custom at meat? ' 
line 34629=>     `No,' said  Frodo,  feeling  strangely rustic and untutored. `But if we 
line 34630=>are guests, we bow to  our host, and  after we have eaten we rise  and thank 
line 34631=>him.' 
line 34632=>     'That we do also,' said Faramir. 
line 34633=>     After so long  journeying  and  camping, and  days spent ¤n  the lonely 
line 34634=>
line 34635=>####-wild, the evening meal seemed a feast  to the hobbits:  to drink pale yellow 
line 34636=>wine, cool and  fragrant,  and eat bread  and butter, and salted  meats, and 
line 34637=>dried fruits,  and good red cheese, with clean  hands and clean  knives  and 
line 34638=>plates. Neither Frodo  nor  Sam  refused  anything that was  offered,  nor a  
line 34639=>second, nor indeed a  third helping.  The  wine coursed in their  veins  and 
line 34640=>tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since 
line 34641=>they left the land of Lurien. 
line 34642=>     When all was done Faramir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, 
line 34643=>partly screened by curtains; and a chair and two stools were brought  there. 
line 34644=>A little earthenware lamp burned in a niche. 
line 34645=>     `You may soon desire to sleep,' he said, 'and especially good  Samwise, 
line 34646=>who would not close his eyes before he ate -- whether for  fear  of blunting 
line 34647=>the edge of  a noble hunger, or for fear of me, I do not know. But it is not 
line 34648=>good to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. Let  us talk a  
line 34649=>while. On your journey from  Rivendell there must have  been many  things to 
line 34650=>tell.  And you, too,  would perhaps wish to learn  something of  us and  the 
line 34651=>lands where  you  now  are.  Tell me  of  Boromir my  brother,  and  of  old 
line 34652=>Mithrandir, and of the fair people of Lothlurien.' 
line 34653=>     Frodo no longer felt  sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the 
line 34654=>food and wine had put  him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. Sam 
line 34655=>was beaming  and humming  to himself, but when  Frodo  spoke he was at first  
line 34656=>content to  listen,  only occasionally venturing  to  make an exclamation of 
line 34657=>agreement. 
line 34658=>     Frodo told many tales,  yet always he  steered the matter away from the 
line 34659=>quest of the Company and from the Ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part 
line 34660=>Boromir had played in all their adventures. with the  wolves of the wild, in 
line 34661=>the snows  under Caradhras, and in  the  mines of Moria  where Gandalf fell.  
line 34662=>Faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge. 
line 34663=>     `It must have irked Boromir to  run  from Orcs,' he said, `or even from 
line 34664=>the  fell thing you name,  the  Balrog  -- even  though he was the  last  to 
line 34665=>leave.' 
line 34666=>     `He was the last,' said  Frodo, 'but Aragorn was forced to lead us.  He 
line 34667=>alone  knew the way after  Gandalf's fall. But had there  not been us lesser  
line 34668=>folk to care for, I do not think that either he or Boromir would have fled.' 
line 34669=>     `Maybe, it  would  have been  better  had  Boromir  fallen  ther e  with 
line 34670=>Mithrandir,' said Faramir,  `and not gone on  to  the fate that waited above 
line 34671=>the falls of Rauros.' 
line 34672=>
line 34673=>####-     'Maybe. But tell me  now of your own fortunes,' said Frodo, turning the 
line 34674=>matter  aside  once  again.  `For I  would  learn more  of Minas  Ithil  and 
line 34675=>Osgiliath, and  Minas Tirith the long-enduring. What  hope have you for that 
line 34676=>city in your long war? ' 
line 34677=>     'What hope have we? '  said Faramir. 'It is long since we had any hope. 
line 34678=>The  sword  of Elendil, if it  returns indeed, may rekindle it, but I do not 
line 34679=>think  that it will  do  more than put off the evil  day,  unless other help 
line 34680=>unlooked-for also comes, from Elves or  Men.  For the Enemy increases and we 
line 34681=>decrease. We are a failing people, a springless autumn. 
line 34682=>     `The Men of N®menor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward 
line 34683=>regions  of the Great Lands, but for the  most part they fell into evils and 
line 34684=>follies. Many became enamoured of the Darkness and the black arts; some 
line 34685=>were 
line 34686=>given over wholly to  idleness and  ease, and some fought among  themselves,  
line 34687=>until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men. 
line 34688=>     `It is not  said  that evil arts were ever practised in Gondor, or that 
line 34689=>the Nameless One  was ever named in  honour there;  and the  old wisdom  and 
line 34690=>beauty brought  out of  the West remained long in the realm of  the sons  of 
line 34691=>Elendil  the Fair, and they linger  there still.  Yet even so  it was Gondor  
line 34692=>that brought  about  its  own decay,  falling by  degrees  into dotage,  and 
line 34693=>thinking that the Enemy was asleep, who was only banished not destroyed. 
line 34694=>     'Death was ever present, because the N®menoreans still,  as they had in 
line 34695=>their old kingdom,  and so lost it,  hungered after endless life unchanging. 
line 34696=>Kings made tombs more  splendid than  houses of the living. and counted  old 
line 34697=>names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. Childless 
line 34698=>lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in  secret chambers withered men  
line 34699=>compounded  strong  elixirs, or  in high cold  towers asked questions of the 
line 34700=>stars. And the last king of the line of Anbrion had no heir. 
line 34701=>     `But  the  stewards  were wiser  and more  fortunate. Wiser,  for  they 
line 34702=>recruited the strength  of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea -coast, 
line 34703=>and from the hardy mountaineers of Ered  Nimrais. And they made a truce with 
line 34704=>the proud peoples of the  North,  who  often had assailed us, men of  fierce 
line 34705=>valour, but our kin from afar  off, unlike the wild Easterlings or the cruel 
line 34706=>Haradrim. 
line 34707=>     'So it came to  pass in the days of Cirion the Twelfth Steward  (and my 
line 34708=>father is the sit and twentieth) that they rode  to our aid and at the great 
line 34709=>Field  of Celebrant they  destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern 
line 34710=>
line 34711=>####-provinces. These are the Rohirrim,  as we name them, masters  of horses, and 
line 34712=>we ceded to them the fields of Calenardhon  that are since called Rohan; for  
line 34713=>that province  had  long been sparsely peopled. And they became  our allies,  
line 34714=>and have  ever  proved true  to us,  aiding us  at  need,  and  guarding our 
line 34715=>northern marches and the Gap of Rohan. 
line 34716=>     `Of our  lore and manners they have learned what they would,  and their 
line 34717=>lords speak our speech at need; yet for  the most part they hold by the ways 
line 34718=>of their  own  fathers and  to their  own  memories, and  they  speak  among 
line 34719=>themselves  their own North  tongue. And  we  love them: tall men  and  fair  
line 34720=>women,  valiant  both  alike, golden-haired, bright-eyed,  and strong;  they 
line 34721=>remind us of the youth of Men, as they were in the  Elder Days. Indeed it is 
line 34722=>said by our lore-masters that they  have from of  old  this affinity with us 
line 34723=>that they  are  come  from those same  Three  Houses  of  Men  as  were  the 
line 34724=>N®menoreans  in  their  beginning  not  from  Hador  the  Goldenhaired,  the 
line 34725=>Elf-friend, maybe, yet from such of his sons and people as went not over Sea 
line 34726=>into the West, refusing the call. 
line 34727=>     'For so we reckon Men in our lore, calling them the High, or Men of the 
line 34728=>West, which  were N®menoreans; and  the Middle Peoples, Men of the 
line 34729=>Twilight, 
line 34730=>such as are  the Rohirrim and their kin  that  dwell still far in the North; 
line 34731=>and the Wild, the Men of Darkness.  
line 34732=>     `Yet  now,  if the  Rohirrim are  grown in  some  ways more like to us, 
line 34733=>enhanced in arts and gentleness, we too  have become more like  to them, and 
line 34734=>can scarce claim any longer the title High. We are become Middle Men, of the 
line 34735=>Twilight, but with memory of other things.  For  as the Rohirrim do, we  now 
line 34736=>love  war  and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end;  
line 34737=>and  though  we still  hold  that  a  warrior  should have more  skills  and 
line 34738=>knowledge than only the craft of weapons  and slaying, we esteem a  warrior, 
line 34739=>nonetheless, above men  of other  crafts.  Such is the need  of our days. So 
line 34740=>even was  my brother,  Boromir:  a  man of  prowess,  and for  that  he  was 
line 34741=>accounted the best man in Gondor. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of 
line 34742=>Minas  Tirith has  for long  years  been so hardy  in  toil, so  onward into 
line 34743=>battle, or blown a mightier note on the Great Horn.' Faramir sighed and fell 
line 34744=>silent for a while. 
line 34745=>     `You don't say much in all your tales  about the Elves, sir,' said Sam, 
line 34746=>suddenly plucking up courage. He  had noted that Faramir seemed  to refer to 
line 34747=>Elves with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and  
line 34748=>
line 34749=>####-wine, had won Sam's respect and quieted his suspicions. 
line 34750=>     `No indeed, Master Samwise,' said Faramir, `for  I  am  not  learned in 
line 34751=>Elven-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we have changed, 
line 34752=>declining from N®menor to  Middle -earth. For as you may know, if  
line 34753=>Mithrandir 
line 34754=>was  your companion and you have spoken with Elrond, the Edain,  the Fathers 
line 34755=>of the  N®menoreans,  fought  beside the  Elves in the first  wars, and were 
line 34756=>rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the Sea, within sight of 
line 34757=>Elvenhome. But in Middle-earth Men and Elves became estranged in the days 
line 34758=>of 
line 34759=>darkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time in which 
line 34760=>each  kind  walked  further down  their sundered  roads. Men  now  fear  and  
line 34761=>misdoubt the Elves, and yet know little of them. And we of  Gondor grow like 
line 34762=>other  Men, like  the men of  Rohan; for even they, who are the  foes of the 
line 34763=>Dark Lord, shun the Elves and speak of the Golden Wood with dread. 
line 34764=>     `Yet there are among us still  some  who have dealings  with the  Elves 
line 34765=>when they may, and  ever and anon one will go in secret to  Lurien, seldom to 
line 34766=>return. Not I.  For I deem it perilous now for  mortal man  wilfully to seek  
line 34767=>out the Elder People. Yet I envy you that have spoken with the White Lady.' 
line 34768=>     `The Lady of Lurien!  Galadriel!' cried Sam. `You should see her indeed 
line 34769=>you should, sir. I am only a hobbit, and gardening's my job at home, sir, if 
line 34770=>you understand me, and I'm  not much good at poetry  -- not  at making  it: a  
line 34771=>bit of  a comic rhyme, perhaps. now and again, you know, but not real poetry 
line 34772=>-- so I can't tell you what I mean. It ought to  be sung. You'd have  to get 
line 34773=>Strider,  Aragorn that is, or  old Mr. Bilbo, for that.  But I wish  I could 
line 34774=>make a song about her. Beautiful she is, sir! Lovely! Sometimes like a great 
line 34775=>tree  in flower,  sometimes like a white  daffadowndilly,  small and  slender  
line 34776=>like. Hard  as di'monds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight,  cold as frost  
line 34777=>in the stars. Proud and far-off as a snow-mountain, and as merry as any lass 
line 34778=>I  ever saw with daisies  in  her hair in  springtime.  But that's a lot  o' 
line 34779=>nonsense, and all wide of my mark.' 
line 34780=>     'Then she must be lovely indeed,' said Faramir. `Perilously fair.' 
line 34781=>     `I don't know about perilous,' said Sam. `It strikes me that folk takes 
line 34782=>their  peril  with them into Lurien,  and finds  it  there  because  they've 
line 34783=>brought it. But perhaps you could call her perilous, because she's so strong 
line 34784=>in herself. You, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on  a  
line 34785=>rock;  or drownd  yourself, like a hobbit in a  river. But  neither rock nor  
line 34786=>
line 34787=>####-river would be to blame. Now Boro -- ' He stopped and went red in the face.  
line 34788=>     `Yes? Now Boromir you would say?  ' said Faramir. `What would  you say?  
line 34789=>He took his peril with him? ' 
line 34790=>     `Yes sir, begging your pardon, and a  fine man as your brother was if I 
line 34791=>may say  so.  But  you've  been  warm on  the scent all along. Now I watched 
line 34792=>Boromir  and listened to him, from Rivendell  all down the  road --  looking  
line 34793=>after my master, as you'll understand,  and not meaning any harm to  Boromir 
line 34794=>-- and it's my  opinion that  in Lurien he first  saw clearly what I guessed 
line 34795=>sooner: what  he  wanted.  From the  moment he  first  saw it he  wanted the 
line 34796=>Enemy's Ring! ' 
line 34797=>     `Sam!  '  cried Frodo  aghast. He had fallen deep into his own thoughts 
line 34798=>for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late. 
line 34799=>     'Save me! ' said Sam turning white, and then flushing scarlet. `There I 
line 34800=>go  again!  When ever  you open your big mouth you put your foot  in it  the 
line 34801=>Gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. O dear, O dear! 
line 34802=>     `Now look here,  sir!  ' He turned, facing up  to Faramir with  all the 
line 34803=>courage  that he  could muster. `Don't you go taking advantage of my  master 
line 34804=>because his servant's no better than a fool. You've spoken very handsome all  
line 34805=>along,  put me off my  guard,  talking of Elves and all. But  handsome is as 
line 34806=>handsome does we say. Now's a chance to show your quality.' 
line 34807=>     'So  it seems,' said Faramir,  slowly and  very  softly, with a strange 
line 34808=>smile.  `So that  is the answer  to all the riddles! The One Ring  that  was 
line 34809=>thought to  have perished  fr om  the world. And Boromir tried to take  it by 
line 34810=>force? And you escaped? And ran all the way -- to me! And here in the wild I 
line 34811=>have  you:  two halflings,  and a host of men at  my  call, and the  Ring of 
line 34812=>Rings. A pretty stroke of fortune!  A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor, 
line 34813=>to show his quality! Ha!'  He stood up,  very tall and stern, his  grey eyes 
line 34814=>glinting. 
line 34815=>     Frodo and Sam sprang from their stools and set themselves  side by side 
line 34816=>with their backs  to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts.  There was  a 
line 34817=>silence.  All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in 
line 34818=>wonder. But Faramir sat down  again in his chair and began to laugh quietly,  
line 34819=>and then suddenly became grave again. 
line 34820=>     'Alas  for Boromir! It was too sore a trial!  ' he said. `How you  have 
line 34821=>increased my sorrow, you two  strange wanderers from a  far country, bearing 
line 34822=>the peril of Men! But you are less judges of Men than I of Halflings. We are 
line 34823=>truth-speakers, we men  of Gondor. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die 
line 34824=>
line 34825=>####-in the attempt. Not if  I found it  on the  highway would I take it  I said. 
line 34826=>Even if I were such a man as  to desire this thing, and  even though I  knew 
line 34827=>not clearly what  this thing was  when  I spoke, still I should  take  those 
line 34828=>words as a vow, and be held by them. 
line 34829=>     'But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough  to  know that  there are 
line 34830=>some  perils from which a  man  must  flee.  Sit at peace! And be comforted, 
line 34831=>Samwise. If  you seem to have stumbled, think  that it was  fated to  be so. 
line 34832=>Your heart is shr ewd as  well  as  faithful, and saw clearer than your eyes.  
line 34833=>For  strange though it  may seem,  it was safe to declare this to me. It may 
line 34834=>even help the  master that you love. It shall turn to his good, if it is  in 
line 34835=>my power. So be comforted. But do not even name this thing again aloud. Once 
line 34836=>is enough.' 
line 34837=>     The hobbits came back  to  their seats and sat very  quiet. Men  turned 
line 34838=>back to  their drink and their talk, perceiving  that their captain had  had 
line 34839=>some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over. 
line 34840=>     'Well, Frodo, now at last we understand one another,' said Faramir. 'If 
line 34841=>you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others' asking, then you have 
line 34842=>pity and honour from me. And I marvel at you: to keep  it hid and not to use 
line 34843=>it.  You  are a   new people and a new world to me. Are  all your kin of like 
line 34844=>sort? Your  land  must  be a realm  of peace  and content,  and  there  must  
line 34845=>gardeners be in high honour.' 
line 34846=>     `Not all  is  well  there,'  said Frodo, `but  certainly gardeners  are 
line 34847=>honoured.' 
line 34848=>     `But folk  must  grow weary  there, even  in their  gardens, as  do all 
line 34849=>things under the Sun  of this world. And you are far from  home and wayworn. 
line 34850=>No more tonight. Sleep, both  of you -- in peace, if you can. Fear not! I do 
line 34851=>not wish to  see it, or  touch  it, or know more of it than I know (which is 
line 34852=>enough), lest peril perchance waylay  me and I  fall lower  in the test than 
line 34853=>Frodo son of Drogo. Go now to rest -- but  first tell  me only, if you will, 
line 34854=>whither you wish to go,  and  what  to do.  For I  must watch, and  wait, and 
line 34855=>think.  Time passes.  In the morning  we  must each  go swiftly  on the ways 
line 34856=>appointed to us.' 
line 34857=>     Frodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed. Now 
line 34858=>a great  weariness came  down on him like  a  cloud. He could dissemble  and 
line 34859=>resist no longer. 
line 34860=>     'I was going to find a way into Mordor,' he said faintly. `I  was going 
line 34861=>to Gorgoroth. I must  find  the Mountain of Fire and cast the thing into the 
line 34862=>
line 34863=>####-gulf of Doom. Gandalf said so. I do not think I shall ever get there.' 
line 34864=>     Faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then suddenly 
line 34865=>he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, carried him  to the  bed 
line 34866=>and laid  him there,  and covered him warmly.  At  once he fell into a  deep 
line 34867=>sleep. 
line 34868=>     Another bed  was  set beside him for his  servant. Sam hesitated for  a  
line 34869=>moment, then bowing very low: `Good night, Captain, my lord,' he said.  `You  
line 34870=>took the chance, sir.' 
line 34871=>     `Did I so?' said Faramir. 
line 34872=>     `Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.' 
line 34873=>     Faramir smiled. 'A pert servant, Master Samwise. But nay: the praise of 
line 34874=>the  praiseworthy is above all rewards.  Yet  there  was naught  in  this to 
line 34875=>praise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have done.' 
line 34876=>     `Ah  well,  sir,' said Sam, `you said  my master had an elvish air  and 
line 34877=>that was good and true. But I can say this:  you have an air too, sir,  that 
line 34878=>reminds me of, of  -- well, Gandalf, of wizards.  
line 34879=>     'Maybe,'  said  Faramir. `Maybe you discern from  far away the  air  of 
line 34880=>N®menor. Good n ight!'

line 34888=> 
line 34889=>     Frodo  woke to  find  Faramir bending over him. For a  second old fears 
line 34890=>seized him and he sat up and shrank away. 
line 34891=>     `There is nothing to fear,' said Faramir. 
line 34892=>     'Is it morning already? ' said Frodo yawning. 
line 34893=>     `Not yet, but night is drawing to an end, and the full moon is setting. 
line 34894=>Will  you  come and see it?  Also there  is a matter on which I desire  your 
line 34895=>counsel. I am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you come? ' 
line 34896=>     `I will,' said Frodo, rising and shivering a little as he left the warm 
line 34897=>blanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the  fireless  cave. The  noise of  the 
line 34898=>water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed Faramir. 
line 34899=>     Sam, waking  suddenly  by some instinct of watchfulness,  saw first his 
line 34900=>master's empty  bed  and  leapt to his feet. Then  he saw  two dark figures, 
line 34901=>Frodo  and a  man, framed  against the archway, which was now filled with  a 
line 34902=>pale  white  light. He  hurried after  them,  past rows of men  sleeping  on 
line 34903=>mattresses along the  wall. As he went by  the  cave-mouth  he saw  that the 
line 34904=>Curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread: 
line 34905=>melting icicles of moonlight. But he did not pause to admire it, and turning 
line 34906=>aside he followed his  master thr ough the narrow  doorway in the wall of the 
line 34907=>cave. 
line 34908=>     They went first  along a black passage, then up  many wet steps, and so 
line 34909=>came to a small flat  landing cut in the stone  and  lit  by  the pale  sky, 
line 34910=>gleaming  high  above through a  long deep shaft.  From here two flights  of 
line 34911=>steps led: one going on, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream; 
line 34912=>the other turning away to the left. This they  followed. It wound its way up 
line 34913=>like a turret-stair. 
line 34914=>     At last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were 
line 34915=>on a wide  flat rock without rail or parapet. At their right, eastwards, the 
line 34916=>torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then,  pouring down  a steep 
line 34917=>race, it filled  a smooth-hewn channel with  a  dark  force of water flecked 
line 34918=>with  foam,  and curling and rushing almost at  their  feet it  plunged sheer  
line 34919=>over the  edge that  yawned  upon their left.  A man  stood  there, near the  
line 34920=>brink, silent, gazing down. 
line 34921=>     Frodo turned to  watch the sleek necks of the  water as they curved and 
line 34922=>
line 34923=>####-dived.  Then he lifted his  eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and  
line 34924=>cold,  as if dawn were near. Far off in  the West the full moon was sinking, 
line 34925=>round and white. Pale mists shimmered in the  great vale below:  a wide gulf 
line 34926=>of silver fume,  beneath which rolled the cool night-waters of the Anduin. A 
line 34927=>black  darkness  loomed beyond,  and  in  it glinted, here and  there, cold, 
line 34928=>sharp, remote, white as  the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of Ered Nimrais, the 
line 34929=>White Mountains of the Realm of Gondor, tipped with everlasting snow. 
line 34930=>     For a while Frodo  stood  there on  the  high stone, and  a shiver  ran 
line 34931=>through him,  wondering if anywhere in  the vastness  of the night -lands his 
line 34932=>old companions walked  or slept,  or lay dead  shrouded in  mist. Why was he 
line 34933=>brough t here out of forgetful sleep?  
line 34934=>     Sam was eager for  an answer to the same question and could not refrain 
line 34935=>himself from muttering, for  his master's ear alone as  he thought: 'It's  a  
line 34936=>fine view, no doubt, Mr. Frodo, but chilly to the heart, not to mention   the 
line 34937=>bones! What's going on? ' 
line 34938=>     Faramir heard and answered. `Moonset over Gondor. Fair Ithil as he goes 
line 34939=>from Middle-earth,  glances upon  the white  locks of old Mindolluin.  It is 
line 34940=>worth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought you to see-though as for 
line 34941=>you,  Samwise,  you  were not  brought, and  do but pay  the penalty of your  
line 34942=>watchfulness. A draught of wine shall amend it. Come, look now! ' 
line 34943=>     He  stepped  up beside the silent sentinel on the dark  edge. and Frodo 
line 34944=>followed.  Sam  hung back. He already felt insecure enough on this high  wet 
line 34945=>platform. Faramir and Frodo looked down. Far below them they  saw  the white 
line 34946=>waters pour into  a foaming  bowl, and then  swirl darkly about  a deep oval 
line 34947=>basin in the rocks. until they found  their  way out  again through a narrow 
line 34948=>gate, and  flowed away, fuming  and  chattering, into  calmer and more level 
line 34949=>reaches. The moonlight still slanted down to the  fall's foot and gleamed on 
line 34950=>the ripples of the basin. Presently Frodo was aware of a small dark thing on 
line 34951=>the  near bank,  but  even as he  looked at  it, it  dived and vanished just  
line 34952=>beyond the boil and bubble of the fall, cleaving the  black  water as neatly 
line 34953=>as an arrow or an edgewise stone. 
line 34954=>     Faramir turned to the man at his side. `Now what would you  say that it 
line 34955=>is,  Anborn? A squirrel, or a kingfisher? Are there black kingfishers in the 
line 34956=>night-pools of Mirkwood?  ' 
line 34957=>     `'Tis not a bird, whatever else it  be,' answered  Anborn. `It has four 
line 34958=>limbs and  dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it  shows, too. What 
line 34959=>is it at? Seeking a way  up behind  the Curtain to our hidings?  It seems we 
line 34960=>
line 34961=>####-are discovered at last. I have my bow here, and I have posted other archers, 
line 34962=>nigh  as good  marksmen  as myself, on  either bank.  We  wait only for your 
line 34963=>command to shoot , Captain.' 
line 34964=>     `Shall we shoot? ' said Faramir, turning quickly to Frodo. 
line 34965=>     Frodo did not answer  for a moment. Then `No! ' he said. `No! I beg you  
line 34966=>not to.' If Sam had dared, he  would have said `Yes,' quicker and louder. He 
line 34967=>could not see, but  he guessed well  enough from  their words what they were 
line 34968=>looking at. 
line 34969=>     'You  know,  then, what this thing is? '  said Faramir.  `Come, now you  
line 34970=>have  seen,  tell me why it should be  spared. In all our words together you  
line 34971=>have not once  spoken  of your gangrel companion, and I  let him be for  the 
line 34972=>time.  He could  wait till he  was  caught and  brought before me. I sent my 
line 34973=>keenest huntsmen to seek  him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of 
line 34974=>him till now, save Anborn here, once  at dusk yesterevening. But now  he has 
line 34975=>done worse trespass than  only  to go  coney-snaring in the uplands: he  has 
line 34976=>dared to come to Henneth  Annyn,  and his life is forfeit.  I marvel at  the 
line 34977=>creature: so secret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before 
line 34978=>our very window. Does he think  that men sleep without watch all  night? Why 
line 34979=>does he so?' 
line 34980=>     'There are two answers, I think,' said  Frodo. `For one thing, he knows 
line 34981=>little of Men, and sly though he  is, your refuge is so  hidden that perhaps 
line 34982=>he  does  not know that Men are concealed here.  For another, I think  he is 
line 34983=>allured here by a mastering desire, stronger than his caution.' 
line 34984=>     `He is lured here, you  say? ' said  Faramir in  a low voice. `Can  he, 
line 34985=>does he then know of your burden? ' 
line 34986=>     `Indeed yes. He bore it himself for many years.' 
line 34987=>     'He  bore  it? ' said Faramir, breathing sharply in  his wonder.  `This 
line 34988=>matter winds itself ever in new riddles. Then he is pursuing it? ' 
line 34989=>     'Maybe. It is precious to him. But I did not speak of that.' 
line 34990=>     `What then does the creature seek? ' 
line 34991=>     `Fish,' said Frodo. `Look! ' 
line 34992=>     They peered down at the dark pool. A little black head  appeared at the 
line 34993=>far end of the basin,  just out of the deep shadow of the rocks. There was a  
line 34994=>brief silver glint, and a swirl  of tiny ripples. It swam to  the side,  and 
line 34995=>then with  marvellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and 
line 34996=>up the bank. At once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing  
line 34997=>that glittered  as it  turned:  the  last rays of the moon  were now  falling 
line 34998=>
line 34999=>####-behind the stony wall at the pool's end. 
line 35000=>     Faramir  laughed softly.  `Fish! '  he said.  `It  is  a less  perilous 
line 35001=>hunger. Or maybe not: fish from  the pool of Henneth Annyn  may cost him all 
line 35002=>he has to give.' 
line 35003=>     `Now I have him at the arrow-point,' said Anborn. `Shall  I not  shoot, 
line 35004=>Captain? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.' 
line 35005=>     `Wait, Anborn,'  said Faramir.  `This is a harder matter than it seems. 
line 35006=>What have you to say now, Frodo? Why should we spare? ' 
line 35007=>     `The creature is wretched and hungry,' said Frodo, `and unaware of  his 
line 35008=>danger. And Gandalf, your Mithrandir, he  would have  bidden you not to slay 
line 35009=>him for that reason, and for others. He forbade the Elves to do so. I do not 
line 35010=>know clearly why, and  of what I guess I cannot  speak openly out  here. But 
line 35011=>this creature is in some way bound up with my errand. Until you found us and 
line 35012=>took us, he was my guide.' 
line 35013=>     `Your guide! ' said Faramir. `The matter becomes ever stranger. I would 
line 35014=>do much for you, Frodo, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go 
line 35015=>free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be 
line 35016=>caught by  Orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain. He must be slain 
line 35017=>or taken. Slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. But how can  this slippery 
line 35018=>thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft?  ' 
line 35019=>     `Let me go  down quietly to him,' said Frodo. `You  may keep  your bows 
line 35020=>bent, and shoot me at least, if I fail. I shall not run away.' 
line 35021=>     `Go  then and be swift! ' said Faramir. `If  he  comes  off  alive,  he 
line 35022=>should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days. Lead Frodo  
line 35023=>down to the bank, Anborn, and go softly. The thing has a nose and ears. Give 
line 35024=>me your bow.' 
line 35025=>     Anborn grunted and led the way down the winding  sta ir to the  landing, 
line 35026=>and then up the other stair, until  at  last they  came to a narrow  opening 
line 35027=>shrouded with thick bushes. Passing silently through, Frodo found himself on 
line 35028=>the top of  the southern bank above the pool. It  was now dark and the falls 
line 35029=>were  pale and grey,  reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western 
line 35030=>sky. He could not see Gollum. He went forward  a  short way and Anborn  
line 35031=>came 
line 35032=>softly behind him. 
line 35033=>     `Go on!  ' he breathed in  Frodo's ear.  `Have a care to your right. If 
line 35034=>you  fall in the pool, then no one but your fishing friend can help you. And 
line 35035=>forget not that there are bowmen near at hand, though you may not see them.' 
line 35036=>
line 35037=>####-     Frodo crept forward, using his hands Gollum-like to feel his way and to 
line 35038=>steady himself.  The rocks  were  for  the  most part  flat  and smooth  but 
line 35039=>slippery.  He halted listening.  At first he  could  hear  no sound but  the 
line 35040=>unceasing  rush of  the  fall behind him. Then presently he  heard,  not far 
line 35041=>ahead, a hissing murmur. 
line 35042=>     'Fissh, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last, yes.  
line 35043=>Now we can eat fish in  peace. No, not in peace,  precious. For Precious  is 
line 35044=>lost; yes, lost. Dirty hobbits, nasty hobbits. Gone and left us, gollum; and 
line 35045=>Precious is gone.  Only poor  Smjagol all  alone.  No Preciou s.  Nasty  Men,  
line 35046=>they'll  take  it,  steal my Precious. Thieves.  We  hates them. Fissh, nice 
line 35047=>fissh: Makes  us  strong.  Makes eyes bright,  fingers  tight, yes. Throttle 
line 35048=>them, precious. Throttle them all, yes, if we gets chances. Nice fissh. Nice 
line 35049=>fissh!  ' 
line 35050=>     So it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall,  only  interrupted 
line 35051=>by  a faint noise of slavering and gurgling. Frodo  shivered, listening with 
line 35052=>pity and disgust. He wished it would stop, and that he  never need hear that 
line 35053=>voice again. Anborn  was  not far behind. He  could creep back and ask him to 
line 35054=>get the huntsmen  to shoot.  They  would probably get  close  enough,  while 
line 35055=>Gollum was gorging and off his guard. Only one true shot, and Frodo would be 
line 35056=>rid of the miserable voice  for ever. But no, Gollum had a claim on him now. 
line 35057=>The  servant has a  claim on the master  for service, even  service in fear. 
line 35058=>They  would have foundered  in the Dead Marshes but for  Gollum. Frodo 
line 35059=>knew, 
line 35060=>too, somehow, quite clearly that Gandalf would not have wished it. 
line 35061=>     `Smjagol! ' he said softly. 
line 35062=>     `Fissh, nice fissh,' said the voice. 
line 35063=>     `Smjagol! ' he said, a little louder. The voice stopped. 
line 35064=>     `Smjagol,  Master  has come to  look  for  you. Master  is here.  Come, 
line 35065=>Smjagol! ' There was no answer but a soft hiss, as of intaken breath. 
line 35066=>     'Come, Smjagol! ' said Frodo. `We are in danger.  Men will kill you, if 
line 35067=>they find  you  here. Come quickly, if you  wish  to escape  death.  Come to 
line 35068=>Master!' 
line 35069=>     'No!' said the  voice.  `Not nice Master. Leaves  poor Smjagol and goes 
line 35070=>with new friends. Master can wait. Smjagol hasn't finished.' 
line 35071=>     `There's no time,' said Frodo. `Bring fish with you. Come! ' 
line 35072=>     `No! Must finish fish.' 
line 35073=>     'Smjagol! ' said Frodo desperately. 'Precious  will be angry.  I  shall 
line 35074=>
line 35075=>####-take Precious, and I shall say: make  him swallow the bones and choke. Never  
line 35076=>taste fish again. Come, Precious is waiting! ' 
line 35077=>     There  was  a sharp  hiss.  Presently  out of  the darkness Gollum came 
line 35078=>crawling  on all  fours,  like  an  erring  dog  called  to  heel. He had   a 
line 35079=>half-eaten fish  in  his  mouth  and another  in his hand. He came  close to 
line 35080=>Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him.  His pale eyes were shining. 
line 35081=>Then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up. 
line 35082=>     `Nice Master! ' he whispered. `Nice  hobb it, come back to poor Smjagol. 
line 35083=>Good Smjagol comes. Now let's go, go quickly, yes. Through the  trees, while 
line 35084=>the Faces are dark. Yes, come let's go! ' 
line 35085=>     `Yes,  we'll go soon,' said Frodo. `But not at once. I will go with you  
line 35086=>as  I promised. I promise aga in.  But  not now. You are not safe yet. I will  
line 35087=>save you, but you must trust me.' 
line 35088=>     `We  must trust  Master? ' said Gollum doubtfully.  'Why? Why not go at 
line 35089=>once? Where is the other one, the cross rude hobbit? Where is he?' 
line 35090=>     'Away up there,' said Frodo, pointing to the waterfall. 'I am not going 
line 35091=>without him. We must go back to him.' His heart sank. This was too much like 
line 35092=>trickery.  He did not  really fear that  Faramir would allow  Gollum  to  be 
line 35093=>killed, but  he would probably make him prisoner and bind him; and certainly 
line 35094=>what Frodo did would seem a treachery to  the poor  treacherous creature. It  
line 35095=>would  probably be impossible ever to  make  him understand  or believe that 
line 35096=>Frodo had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do? -- 
line 35097=>to keep faith,  as  near  as might be, with both sides. `Come!' he said. `Or 
line 35098=>the Precious will be angry. We are  going back now, up the stream. Go on, go 
line 35099=>on, you go in front! ' 
line 35100=>     Gollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way, snuffling and 
line 35101=>suspicious. Presently he stopped and raised his head. `Something's  there! ' 
line 35102=>he  said.  `Not a  hobbit.'  Suddenly  he turned  back.  A  green  light was 
line 35103=>flickering in  his  bulging  eyes.  `Masster, masster!'  he hissed. 'Wicked!  
line 35104=>Tricksy! False!' He spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping 
line 35105=>fingers.  
line 35106=>     At that moment the great black shape of Anborn loomed up behind him and 
line 35107=>came down  on him. A large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck  and 
line 35108=>pinned him. He  twisted round  like lightning,   all wet and slimy as he was,  
line 35109=>wriggling like an eel, biting  and  scratching like  a cat. But two more men 
line 35110=>came up out of the shadows. 
line 35111=>     'Hold still!  '  said one. `Or we'll stick  you  as full  of pins as  a  
line 35112=>
line 35113=>####-hedgehog. Hold still!' 
line 35114=>     Gollum  went limp, and began to whine and weep. They tied him, none too 
line 35115=>gently. 
line 35116=>     `Easy, easy! ' said Frodo. `He has no strength to match you. Don't hurt 
line 35117=>him, if you can help it. He'll be quieter, if you don't. Smjagol! They won't  
line 35118=>hurt you. I'll go with you, and you shall  come to no  harm. Not unless they 
line 35119=>kill me too. Trust Master! ' 
line 35120=>     Gollum turned and spat at him. The men picked  him up, put  a hood over  
line 35121=>his eyes, and carried him off. 
line 35122=>     Frodo  followed them, feeling  very wretched.  They  went  through  the 
line 35123=>opening behind the bushes. and back, down the stairs  and passages, into the 
line 35124=>cave. Two or three  torches  had been lit. Men were stirring. Sam was there,  
line 35125=>and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men carried. `Got him?' 
line 35126=>he said to Frodo. 
line 35127=>     'Yes. Well no, I didn't get him. He  came to me, because  he trusted me 
line 35128=>at  first, I'm afraid.  I did not want him tied up like this. I hope it will 
line 35129=>be all right; but I hate the whole business.' 
line 35130=>     `So  do I,' said Sam. `And nothing will ever  be all  right  where that 
line 35131=>piece of misery is.' 
line 35132=>     A man came and beckoned to the  hobbits, and took them to the recess at 
line 35133=>the back of the cave. Faramir was sitting there in  his  chair, and the lamp 
line 35134=>had been  rekindled  in its  niche above his head. He signed to them  to  sit 
line 35135=>down  on the  stools beside him. `Bring wine for the guests,'  he said. `And 
line 35136=>bring the prisoner to me.' 
line 35137=>     The wine was brought, and then  Anborn came carrying Gollum. He 
line 35138=>removed 
line 35139=>the cover from  Gollum's head and set him on his feet standing behind him to 
line 35140=>support him. Gollum blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy 
line 35141=>pale lids. A  very miserable creature he looked, dripping and dank, smelling  
line 35142=>of fish (he still clutched one in his  hand); his sparse locks were  hanging 
line 35143=>like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling. 
line 35144=>     `Loose us! Loose us! '  he said.  `The  cord hurts us, yes it does,  it 
line 35145=>hurts us, and we've done nothing.' 
line 35146=>     `Nothing? ' said  Faramir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen 
line 35147=>glance, but  without any expression in his face either of anger, or pity, or 
line 35148=>wonder. 'Nothing? Have you never done anything worthy of binding or of 
line 35149=>worse 
line 35150=>
line 35151=>####-punishment? However, that  is not for me to judge, happily. But tonight  you  
line 35152=>have  come  where  it  is  death to come. The fish of this  pool  are dearly 
line 35153=>bought.' 
line 35154=>     Gollum dropped the fish from his hand. `Don't want fish,' he said. 
line 35155=>     'The  price  is not set on the fish,' said  Faramir. `Only to come here 
line 35156=>and look on the pool bears the penalty of death. I have spared you so far at 
line 35157=>the  prayer  of Frodo here, who says that  of him at least you have deserved 
line 35158=>some thanks. But you must also satisfy me. What is  your name? Whence do 
line 35159=>you 
line 35160=>come? And whither do you go? What is your business?  ' 
line 35161=>     `We are  lost, lost,' said  Gollum. 'No name, no business, no Precious, 
line 35162=>nothing. Only empty. Only hungry; yes, we  are hungry. A  few little fishes,  
line 35163=>nasty bony little fishes, for a  poor creature, and they say  death. So wise 
line 35164=>they are; so just, so very just.' 
line 35165=>     'Not very wise,' said Faramir.  'But just: yes perhaps, as just  as our 
line 35166=>little wisdom allows. Unloose him Frodo! ' Faramir  took a small  nail-knife 
line 35167=>from his belt and  handed it to Frodo. Gollum misunderstanding  the gesture,  
line 35168=>squealed and fell down. 
line 35169=>     'Now, Smjagol! ' said Frodo.  'You must trust me. I will not desert you. 
line 35170=>Answer truthfully, if you can.  It will  do you  good not  harm.' He cut the 
line 35171=>cords on Gollum's wrists and ankles and raised him to his feet. 
line 35172=>     'Come hither! ' said Faramir. `Look at me! Do you know the name of this 
line 35173=>place? Have you been here before? ' 
line 35174=>     Slowly Gollum  raised his eyes and  looked  unwillingly into Faramir's.  
line 35175=>All light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into 
line 35176=>the clear unwavering  eyes of the man of Gondor. There  was a still silence. 
line 35177=>Then Gollum dropped his  head and shrank down, until he was squatting on the 
line 35178=>floor,  shivering.  'We  doesn't  know  and we  doesn't want  to  know,'  he  
line 35179=>whimpered. `Never came here; never come again.' 
line 35180=>     `There are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms 
line 35181=>behind them,' said Faramir. `But in this I judge  that you speak  the truth. 
line 35182=>It is well  for you. What oath will  you swear never to return; and never to 
line 35183=>lead any living creature hither by word or sign?' 
line 35184=>     `Master knows,'  said Gollum with a  sidelong glance at Frodo. `Yes, he 
line 35185=>knows. We will promise Master, if he saves us. We'll promise to It, yes.' He 
line 35186=>crawled  to Frodo's feet.  'Save  us,  nice Master!  '  he whined.  `Smjagol 
line 35187=>promises to Precious, promises faithfully. Never come again, never speak, no 
line 35188=>
line 35189=>####-never! No, precious, no!' 
line 35190=>     `Are you satisfied? ' said Faramir. 
line 35191=>     `Yes,' said Frodo.  'At least, you must  either  accept this promise or 
line 35192=>carry out your law. You will get no more. But I promised that if he came  to  
line 35193=>me, he should not be harmed. And I would not be proved faithless.' 
line 35194=>     Faramir sat for a moment in thought. `Very good,' he  said at last.  `I  
line 35195=>surrender you to your master, to Frodo son of Drogo. Let him declare what he 
line 35196=>will do with you! ' 
line 35197=>     'But, Lord Faramir,' said Frodo bowing, `you have not yet declared your 
line 35198=>will  concerning  the said Frodo, and until  that is  made known, he  cannot 
line 35199=>shape his plans for himself  or his companions. Your judgement was postponed 
line 35200=>until the morning; but that is now at hand.' 
line 35201=>     `Then I  will declare my doom,' said Faramir. `As for you, Frodo, in so 
line 35202=>far as lies in me under higher  authority, I declare you  free in  the realm 
line 35203=>of, Gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds; save only that neither you  
line 35204=>nor any that go with you have leave to come  to  this  place unbidden.  This 
line 35205=>doom  shall  stand for a  year and a day, and  then cease,  unless you shall 
line 35206=>before that term come to Minas Tirith and present yourself to  the  Lord and  
line 35207=>Steward of the City. Then I will entreat him to confirm what I have done and 
line 35208=>to make  it  lifelong.  In the  meantime,  whomsoever  you  take  under your  
line 35209=>protection shall be under my protection  and under the shield of Gondor. Are 
line 35210=>you answered? ' 
line 35211=>     Frodo bowed low. 'I am answered,' he  said, `and I place myself at your 
line 35212=>service, if that is of any worth to one so high and honourable.' 
line 35213=>     `It is  of  great  worth,' said  Faramir.  'And  now, do you  take this 
line 35214=>creature, this Smjagol, under your protection? ' 
line 35215=>     `I  do  take  Smjagol under  my  protection,' said  Frodo.  Sam  sighed 
line 35216=>audibly;  and  not  at  the courtesies, of which, as  any  hobbit  would, he 
line 35217=>thoroughly approved. Indeed in the Shire such a matter would have required a  
line 35218=>great many more words and bows.  
line 35219=>     'Then I say  to you,'  said Faramir, turning to  Gollum, 'you  are under  
line 35220=>doom of  death; but while you walk with Frodo you are safe for our part. Yet 
line 35221=>if ever you be found by any man of Gondor astray without him, the doom shall 
line 35222=>fall. And may death find  you swiftly, within Gondor  or  without,  if you do 
line 35223=>not well serve him. Now answer me: whither would you go? You were his 
line 35224=>guide, 
line 35225=>he says. Whither were you leading him? ' Gollum made no reply. 
line 35226=>
line 35227=>####-     `This I will not  have secret,'  said Faramir. `Answer me,  or  I  will 
line 35228=>reverse my judgement! ' Still Gollum did not answer. 
line 35229=>     `I will answer for him,' said Frodo. `He brought  me to the Black Gate, 
line 35230=>as I asked; but it was impassable.' 
line 35231=>     `There is no open gate into the Nameless Land,' said Faramir. 
line 35232=>     `Seeing this, we  turned aside and came by  the Southward road '  Frodo 
line 35233=>continued; 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to Minas 
line 35234=>Ithil.' 
line 35235=>     `Minas Morgul,' said Faramir. 
line 35236=>     `I do not know clearly,' said Frodo; `but the path  climbs, I think, up 
line 35237=>into  the mountains  on the  northern side of that vale  where  the old city 
line 35238=>stands. It goes up to a high cleft and so down to -- that which is beyond.' 
line 35239=>     `Do you know the name of that high pass? ' said Faramir. 
line 35240=>     'No,' said Frodo. 
line 35241=>     'It is  called Cirith Ungol.' Gollum hissed sharply and began muttering 
line 35242=>to himself. `Is not that its name? ' said Faramir turning to him. 
line 35243=>     `No! '  said  Gollum, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed 
line 35244=>him. 'Yes, yes, we heard the name once. But what does the name matter to us? 
line 35245=>Master  says he must get in. So we must try some way. There is no  other way 
line 35246=>to try, no.' 
line 35247=>     'No  other way?  ' said  Faramir. `How do  you  know  that? And who has 
line 35248=>explored  all  the  confines  of  that  dark  realm? '  He  looked long  and 
line 35249=>thoughtfully at Gollum. Presently he spoke  again. `Take this creature away, 
line 35250=>Anborn. Treat  him gently, but watch  him.  And do not you,  Smjagol, try to 
line 35251=>dive into the falls.  The rocks  have such  teeth  there  as would  slay you  
line 35252=>before your time. Leave us now and take your fish! ' 
line 35253=>     Anborn  went out  and Gollum went cringing before him.  The curtain was 
line 35254=>drawn across the recess.  
line 35255=>     `Frodo, I think you do very unwisely in this,' said Faramir.  `I do not 
line 35256=>think you should go with this creature. It is wicked.' 
line 35257=>     'No, not altogether wicked,' said Frodo. 
line 35258=>     'Not wholly, perhaps,' said Faramir; 'but malice eats it like a canker, 
line 35259=>and the  evil is growing. He will lead you to no good. If you will part with 
line 35260=>him, I will give him safe-conduct and guidance to  any  point on the borders 
line 35261=>of Gondor that he may name.' 
line 35262=>     `He would not take  it,' said  Frodo.  'He would  follow after me as he 
line 35263=>long  has  done.  And I  have  promised  many  times  to  take him under  my  
line 35264=>
line 35265=>####-protection  and to go where he led. You would not ask me to break faith with 
line 35266=>him?' 
line 35267=>     'No,'  said  Faramir. `But my  heart would. For it  seems less  evil to 
line 35268=>counsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself, especially if  one 
line 35269=>sees a friend bound unwitting to his own  harm. But no  -- if he will go with 
line 35270=>you, you must  now endure him. But I do not think  you are  holden to go  to 
line 35271=>Cirith  Ungol, of which  he has told you  less than  he  knows. That much  I 
line 35272=>perceived clearly in his mind. Do not go to Cirith Ungol!' 
line 35273=>     `Where then shall  I  go?  ' said   Frodo.  `Back  to the Black Gate and 
line 35274=>deliver  myself  up  to the guard? What do  you know against this place that 
line 35275=>makes its name so dreadful? ' 
line 35276=>     `Nothing certain,' said Faramir. 'We of Gondor do not ever pass east of 
line 35277=>the Road in these days, and none of us younger men has ever done so, nor has 
line 35278=>any  of us  set foot upon the  Mountains of Shadow. Of them we know only old 
line 35279=>report and the  rumour of bygone  days. But there  is some  dark terror that 
line 35280=>dwells in the  passes above Minas Morgul. If Cirith Ungol  is named, old men 
line 35281=>and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent. 
line 35282=>     ,The valley  of Minas Morgul passed into evil very long ago, and it was 
line 35283=>a menace  and  a  dread while the banished  Enemy dwelt  yet far  away,  and 
line 35284=>Ithilien was still for the most par t in our keeping.  As you know, that city 
line 35285=>was once a strong place, proud and fair, Minas Ithil, the twin sister of our 
line 35286=>own city.  But it was taken by fell men whom the Enemy in his first strength 
line 35287=>had dominated, and who wandered homeless and masterless  aft er his fall.  It 
line 35288=>is said  that  their lords  were  men of  N®menor  who had fallen  into dark 
line 35289=>wickedness; to them the Enemy had  given rings of power, and he had 
line 35290=>devoured 
line 35291=>them: living ghosts  they were become, terrible  and  evil. After  his going 
line 35292=>they took Minas  Ithil and  dwelt  there,  and they  filled  it, and all the 
line 35293=>valley about, with decay: it seemed empty  and was  not so,  for a shapeless 
line 35294=>fear  lived  within the ruined walls. Nine Lords there  were, and after  the 
line 35295=>return  of their Master, which they aided and prepared  in secret, they grew 
line 35296=>strong again.  Then the Nine Riders issued forth from  the  gates of horror, 
line 35297=>and we could not withstand them. Do not approach their  citadel. You will be 
line 35298=>espied. It  is a place of  sleepless malice, full of lidless eyes. Do not go 
line 35299=>that way!  ' 
line 35300=>     'But where else will you direct me? ' said Frodo. 'You cannot yourself,  
line 35301=>you say, guide me to the mountains, nor over  them. But over the mountains I 
line 35302=>
line 35303=>####-am bound, by solemn  undertaking to the  Council, to find a way or perish in 
line 35304=>the seeking. And if  I turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where 
line 35305=>then  shall I go  among Elves or Men? Would you have  me come to Gondor 
line 35306=>with 
line 35307=>this Thing, the Thing  that drove your  brother mad with  desire? What spell  
line 35308=>would it work in Minas Tirith?  Shall  there be two  cities of Minas Morgul,  
line 35309=>grinning at each other across a dead land filled with rottenness? ' 
line 35310=>     `I would not have it so,' said Faramir. 
line 35311=>     `Then what would you have me do? ' 
line 35312=>     `I know not. Only I would not have you go to death or to torment. And I 
line 35313=>do not think that Mithrandir would have chosen this way.' 
line 35314=>     'Yet since he is gone, I must take such paths as I can find.  And there 
line 35315=>is no time for long searching,' said Frodo. 
line 35316=>     `It is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,'  said  Faramir.  'But at the 
line 35317=>least,  remember my  warning:  beware  of this guide,  Smjagol.  He has done 
line 35318=>murder before now. I read it in him.' He sighed. 
line 35319=>     `Well, so we meet and  part,  Frodo son of Drogo. You have no  need  of 
line 35320=>soft words: I do  not hope to see you again on any other day under this Sun. 
line 35321=>But you shall go  now with my blessing upon you,  and upon  all your people. 
line 35322=>Rest a little while food is prepared for you. 
line 35323=>     'I would gladly learn how this creeping Smjagol became possessed of the 
line 35324=>Thing of which we speak, and how he lost it, but I will not trouble you now.  
line 35325=>If ever beyond  hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our 
line 35326=>tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at  old  grief, you shall tell 
line 35327=>me  then.  Until  that  time, or some  other time beyond the vision  of  the 
line 35328=>Seeing-stones of N®menor, farewell! ' 
line 35329=>     He rose and bowed low to Frodo, and drawing the curtain passed out into 
line 35330=>the cave. 
line 35331=> 
line 35332=>
line 35333=>####- 
line 35334=>
line 35335=>Chapter 7. Journey to the Cross-roads 
line 35336=>
line 35337=> 
line 35338=> 
line 35339=>     Frodo and Sam returned  to their  beds and lay there in silence resting 
line 35340=>for a little,  while men bestirred themselves  and  the business of the  day 
line 35341=>began. After a while water was brought to them,  and then they were led to a  
line 35342=>table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had 
line 35343=>not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary. 
line 35344=>     When they had finished they stood up. `May no hunger trouble you on the 
line 35345=>road,'  said  Faramir. `You  have little provision, but some small  store of 
line 35346=>food fit for travellers I have ordered to be stowed  in your packs. You will 
line 35347=>have  no lack  of  water as you walk in Ithilien,  but  do not  drink of any 
line 35348=>stream that flows from Imlad Morgul, the Valley of Living Death. This also I 
line 35349=>must tell you. My scouts and watchers  have all returned, even some that have 
line 35350=>crept within sight of the Morannon. They all find  a strange thing. The land 
line 35351=>is empty.  Nothing  is  on the  road,  and  no sound  of foot, or  horn,  or  
line 35352=>bowstring is anywhere  to be  heard.  A  waiting  silence broods  above  the 
line 35353=>Nameless Land.  I do not know what this portends. But the time draws swiftly 
line 35354=>to some great conclusion. Storm is coming. Hasten while you may! If  you are 
line 35355=>ready, let us go. The Sun will soon rise above the shadow.' 
line 35356=>     The hobbits' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had 
line 35357=>been), and  also two stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with  
line 35358=>carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs.  
line 35359=>     'I  have no fitting  gifts  to  give you at our parting,' said Faramir ; 
line 35360=>`but take these staves. They may be of service to those who walk or climb in 
line 35361=>the wild.  The  men of  the White Mountains use them; though these have been 
line 35362=>cut  down to your  height and  newly  shod. They  are made of the fair  tree 
line 35363=>lebethron, beloved of   the woodwrights of Gondor, and a  virtue has been set 
line 35364=>upon them of finding  and returning.  May that virtue not wholly  fail under  
line 35365=>the Shadow into which you go!' 
line 35366=>     The hobbits  bowed low. `Most  gracious host,' said Frodo, 'it was said 
line 35367=>to me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret 
line 35368=>and unlooked  for. Certainly I looked  for no such  friendship  as you  have 
line 35369=>shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.' 
line 35370=>     Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or  
line 35371=>hiding-hole,  and he seemed  better pleased with himself  than he had  been,  
line 35372=>
line 35373=>####-though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir.  
line 35374=>     'Your  guide  must  be  blindfolded,' said Faramir, 'but  you and  your 
line 35375=>servant Samwise I release from this, if you wish.' 
line 35376=>     Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to 
line 35377=>bind his eyes; and Frodo said: 'Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes 
line 35378=>first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm  is meant.' This  was done, 
line 35379=>and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annyn. After they  had passed the 
line 35380=>passages  and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet,  about 
line 35381=>them. Still blind they went on for  some  little time,  up  and  then gently 
line 35382=>down. At last the voice of Faramir ordered them to be uncovered. 
line 35383=>     They stood under the boughs  of the woods again. No noise  of the falls 
line 35384=>could be heard,  for  a  long  southward slope lay now  between them and the 
line 35385=>ravine in which the stream flowed. To the west they could  see light through 
line 35386=>the trees, as if the  world came there  to a sudden end, at a  brink looking 
line 35387=>out only on to sky. 
line 35388=>     'Here  is the last parting of our ways,' said Faramir. 'If you take  my 
line 35389=>counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. Go  straight on, for  thus you will 
line 35390=>have the cover of the woodland for many miles. On your west is an edge where 
line 35391=>the land falls into the great vales, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes 
line 35392=>in  long  hillsides. Keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. In 
line 35393=>the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight, I think. The land 
line 35394=>dreams in  a false peace, and  for a while  all evil is  withdrawn. Fare you  
line 35395=>well, while you may!' 
line 35396=>     He embraced the hobbits then, after the manner of his people, stooping, 
line 35397=>and placing his hands upon their shoulders, and kissing their foreheads. 'Go 
line 35398=>with the good will of all good men!' he said. 
line 35399=>     They bowed to the ground. Then he  turned and without  looking back  he 
line 35400=>left them  and went to his  two guards that stood at a little distance away. 
line 35401=>They marvelled  to  see  with  what speed  these green-clad men  now  moved, 
line 35402=>vanishing almost in the twinkling of an  eye.  The forest  where Faramir had 
line 35403=>stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed. 
line 35404=>     Frodo sighed and turned back southward. As if to  mark his disregard of 
line 35405=>all such courtesy, Gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. 
line 35406=>`Hungry again already?' thought Sam. `Well, now for it again!' 
line 35407=>     'Have they  gone at last? ' said Gollum. `Nassty wicked Men!  Smjagol's 
line 35408=>neck still hurts him, yes it does. Let's go! ' 
line 35409=>     `Yes, let  us go,' said Frodo. `But  if you can only speak ill of those 
line 35410=>
line 35411=>####-who showed you mercy, keep silent! ' 
line 35412=>     `Nice Master! ' said Gollum. `Smjagol was only joking. Always forgives,  
line 35413=>he  does, yes, yes, even nice Master's little trickses. Oh yes, nice Master, 
line 35414=>nice Smjagol! ' 
line 35415=>     Frodo and Sam did not  answer.  Hoisting their packs and  taking  their 
line 35416=>staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of Ithilien. 
line 35417=>     Twice that day they  rested  and took a little of the food provided  by 
line 35418=>Faramir:  dried fruits and  salted  meat, enough for  many  days;  and bread 
line 35419=>enough to last while it was still fresh. Gollum ate nothing. 
line 35420=>     The sun rose and  passed  overhead unseen, and began to sink,  and  the 
line 35421=>light through  the trees to the west grew golden; and always they  walked in 
line 35422=>cool green  shadow, and all about  them was silence. The birds seemed all to 
line 35423=>have flown away or to have fallen dumb. 
line 35424=>     Darkness came early  to the silent  woods, and before the fall of night 
line 35425=>they halted, weary, for they had walked  seven leagues or more  from Henneth 
line 35426=>Annyn. Frodo lay and  slept  away  the  night  on the  deep mould beneath an 
line 35427=>ancient tree. Sam beside  him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there 
line 35428=>was never a sign of Gollum, who had slipped off as  soon as  the others  had 
line 35429=>settled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had 
line 35430=>wandered  restlessly prowling through  the  night, he did  not say;  but  he 
line 35431=>returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions.  
line 35432=>     `Must get up, yes  they must!'  he  said. 'Long ways to go still, south 
line 35433=>and east. Hobbits must make haste!' 
line 35434=>     That day passed  much  as the  day  before had  gone,  except that  the 
line 35435=>silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under  
line 35436=>the trees. It felt as if thunder was  brewing. Gollum often paused, sniffing 
line 35437=>the air, and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed.  
line 35438=>     As the third stage of  their day's  march drew on  and afternoon wa ned, 
line 35439=>the forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more scattered. Great 
line 35440=>ilexes of  huge girth stood  dark  and solemn in  wide glades with  here and 
line 35441=>there among  them  hoary ash-trees. and  giant oaks  just putting  out their 
line 35442=>brown-green  buds.  About them  lay long launds of green  grass dappled with 
line 35443=>celandine and anemones, white and blue, now folded for sleep; and there were 
line 35444=>acres  populous with  the leaves of  woodland hyacinths: already their sleek  
line 35445=>bell-stems were  thrusting through the  mould . No  living creature, beast or  
line 35446=>bird, was to be seen, but in these open places Gollum grew afraid, and  they  
line 35447=>walked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another. 
line 35448=>
line 35449=>####-     Light  was fading fast when they came to the forest -end. There they sat 
line 35450=>under  an old gnarled oak that  sent its roots twisting like snakes  down  a  
line 35451=>steep crumbling bank. A deep dim valley lay before them. On its further side 
line 35452=>the  woods gathered  again,  blue  and grey under  the  sullen  evening, and 
line 35453=>marched on southwards. To the  right the Mountains of Gondor  glowed, 
line 35454=>remote 
line 35455=>in  the  West,  under  a fire-flecked  sky. To  the left  lay darkness:  the 
line 35456=>towering walls of Mordor;  and  out of  that darkness the long valley  came, 
line 35457=>falling steeply in an ever -widening trough towards the Anduin. At its bottom 
line 35458=>ran a hurrying stream:  Frodo could  hear its stony voice coming  up through 
line 35459=>the silence; and beside  it on the hither side a road went winding down like 
line 35460=>a pale ribbon, down into chill grey mists that  no  gleam of sunset touched. 
line 35461=>There it seemed to  Frodo that he descried far off, floating as it were on a  
line 35462=>shadowy sea, the high  dim  tops and broken pinnacles of old  towers forlorn 
line 35463=>and dark. 
line 35464=>     He turned to Gollum. `Do you know where we are? ' he said. 
line 35465=>     'Yes,  Master. Dangerous places. This is the road from the Tower of the 
line 35466=>Moon, Master, down to the ruined city by the shores of the River. The ruined 
line 35467=>city, yes, very nasty place, full of  enemies. We shouldn't have taken Men's 
line 35468=>advice. Hobbits have come a long way out of the path. Must go east now, away 
line 35469=>up there.' He waved his skinny arm  towards  the darkling mountains. `And we 
line 35470=>can't  use  this  road. Oh  no!  Cruel peoples come this way, down  from the 
line 35471=>Tower.' 
line 35472=>     Frodo looked down on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving  on it  
line 35473=>now. It appeared lonely  and forsaken, running  down to empty  ruins  in the 
line 35474=>mist. But there was an evil feeling in the air, as if things might indeed be 
line 35475=>passing up and down that  eyes could  not see. Frodo shuddered  as he looked 
line 35476=>again  at the distant pinnacles now dwindling into  night, and the  sound of 
line 35477=>the water  seemed  cold  and cruel: the voice  of Morgulduin,  the  polluted 
line 35478=>stream that flowed from the Valley of the Wraiths.  
line 35479=>     'What shall we do?  ' he said.  'We have walked long  and far. Shall we 
line 35480=>look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden? ' 
line 35481=>     'No good  hiding in the  dark,' said Gollum. 'It's in day that  hobbits 
line 35482=>must hide now, yes in day.' 
line 35483=>     `Oh come! ' said Sam.  'We must rest for a bit, even if we get up again 
line 35484=>in the middle of the night. There'll still be hours of dark then time enough 
line 35485=>for you to take us a long march, if you know the way.' 
line 35486=>
line 35487=>####-     Gollum  reluctantly agreed  to  this, and  he  turned  back towards the 
line 35488=>trees, working eastward for a  while along the straggling edges of the wood.  
line 35489=>He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate 
line 35490=>they  all climbed  up into  the  crotch of  a  large  holm-oak, whose  thick  
line 35491=>branches springing together from  the trunk made a good  hiding-place and  a 
line 35492=>fairly comfortable refuge.  Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the 
line 35493=>canopy of the  tree.  Frodo and Sam drank a  little water and ate some bread 
line 35494=>and dried fruit, but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits 
line 35495=>did not shut their eyes. 
line 35496=>     It must have been a little after midnight when Gollum woke up: suddenly 
line 35497=>they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. He  listened and 
line 35498=>sniffed,  which seemed,  as  they had noticed before,  his  usual method  of 
line 35499=>discovering the time of night. 
line 35500=>     'Are we rested? Have we had beautiful sleep?' he said. 'Let's go!' 
line 35501=>     'We aren't, and we haven't,' growled Sam. 'But we'll go if we must.' 
line 35502=>     Gollum dropped at once  from  the branches of the tree on to all fours,  
line 35503=>and the hobbits followed more slowly. 
line 35504=>     As  soon  as they  were down they  went  on again  with Gollum leading,  
line 35505=>eastwards, up the  dark sloping  land. They could see little,  for the night 
line 35506=>was  now so deep that  they were  hardly aware of the  stems of trees before 
line 35507=>they stumbled  against them. The ground  became more broken  and walking 
line 35508=>was 
line 35509=>more  difficult, but Gollum seemed in no  way troubled. He  led them through 
line 35510=>thickets and wastes of brambles; sometimes round  the lip of a deep cleft or  
line 35511=>dark pit, sometimes down into black bush-shrouded hollows and out again; but 
line 35512=>if ever they went a little downward, always the further slope was longer and 
line 35513=>steeper. They were climbing steadily. At their first  halt they looked back, 
line 35514=>and they could  dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they   had left behind 
line 35515=>lying like  a  vast  dense shadow, a darker night under the  dark blank sky. 
line 35516=>There seemed to be a great  blackness looming slowly out of the East, eating  
line 35517=>up the faint blurred stars. Later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing 
line 35518=>cloud, but it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare. 
line 35519=>     At last  Gollum  turned  to the hobbits. 'Day soon,' he  said. 'Hobbits 
line 35520=>must hurry. Not safe to stay in the open in these places. Make haste! ' 
line 35521=>     He quickened his pace, and they  followed him wearily.  Soon they began 
line 35522=>to climb up on to a great hog-back of land. For the most part it was covered 
line 35523=>with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and  low tough thorns, though 
line 35524=>
line 35525=>####-here and there clearings opened, the scars of recent fires. The gorse-bushes 
line 35526=>became  more frequent  as they  got nearer the  top; very old and  tall they 
line 35527=>were, gaunt and leggy below but thick above, and already  putting out yellow 
line 35528=>flowers  that  glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint  sweet scent. So tall 
line 35529=>were the spiny  thickets that the  hobbits could  walk upright  under  them, 
line 35530=>passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould. 
line 35531=>     On the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their march and  
line 35532=>crawled for hiding  underneath a  tangled  knot  of  thorns.  Their  twisted 
line 35533=>boughs, stooping to the ground, were overridden  by a clambering maze of old 
line 35534=>briars. Deep inside there  was  a hollow hall, raftered with dead branch and 
line 35535=>bramble, and roofed with the first leaves and  shoots  of spring. There they 
line 35536=>lay for a  while, too tired yet to eat; and peering out through the holes in 
line 35537=>the covert they watched for the slow growth of day. 
line 35538=>     But no  day  came, only a dead brown twilight. In the East  there was a  
line 35539=>dull red glare under the lowering cloud: it  was not the red of dawn. Across 
line 35540=>the tumbled lands between, the mountains of the Ephel D®ath frowned at 
line 35541=>them, 
line 35542=>black and shapeless below where night lay thick and did not pass away, above 
line 35543=>with  jagged  tops  and edges outlined  hard and  menacing against the fiery 
line 35544=>glow. Away to their right a great shoulder of the mountains  stood out, dark 
line 35545=>and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward. 
line 35546=>     `Which way do we go from here?' asked Frodo. `Is that the opening of-of 
line 35547=>the Morgul Valley, away over there beyond that black mass? ' 
line 35548=>     `Need we think about it yet?' said Sam, `Surely we're not going to move 
line 35549=>any more today, if day it is?' 
line 35550=>     `Perhaps not, perhaps not,' said Gollum.  `But we must go soon, to  the 
line 35551=>Cross-roads.  Yes,  to  the  Cross-roads. That's the  way  over  ther e  yes, 
line 35552=>Master.' 
line 35553=>     The red glare over Mordor  died  away. The twilight deepened  as  great 
line 35554=>vapours rose in the East and crawled above them. Frodo and Sam took a little 
line 35555=>food and then  lay down,  but Gollum was restless.  He would  not eat any of 
line 35556=>their food, but  he  drank  a little water and  then crawled about under the 
line 35557=>bushes, sniffing and muttering. Then. suddenly he disappeared. 
line 35558=>     `Off hunting, I suppose,' said Sam and yawned. It was his turn to sleep 
line 35559=>first, and  he  was soon deep in a dream. He thought he was back in the  Bag 
line 35560=>End garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which 
line 35561=>made him stoop.  It  all seemed very weedy and rank  somehow, and thorns and 
line 35562=>
line 35563=>####-bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge. 
line 35564=>     `A job of work for me, I can see; but I'm so tired,' he kept on saying. 
line 35565=>Presently  he remembered what he was looking  for. `My  pipe!'  he said, and 
line 35566=>with that he woke up. 
line 35567=>     `Silly!' he said  to himself, as he opened his eyes and wondered why he 
line 35568=>was lying  down under the hedge. `It's in  your pack all the time!'  Then he 
line 35569=>realized, first that the pipe might  be in his pack but he had  no leaf, and 
line 35570=>next that he was hundreds of miles from  Bag End. He sat up. It seemed to be 
line 35571=>almost dark. Why had his master let him sleep  on out of turn, right on till 
line 35572=>evening?  
line 35573=>     `Haven't you had no sleep, Mr. Frodo?' he said. 'What's the time? Seems 
line 35574=>to be getting late!' 
line 35575=>     'No it isn't,' said Frodo.  `But  the day is getting darker instead  of 
line 35576=>lighter: darker and  darker. As far as I  can tell, it isn't midday yet, and 
line 35577=>you've only slept for about three hours.' 
line 35578=>     'I wonder what's up,' said  Sam. 'Is there  a storm coming? If  so it's 
line 35579=>going  to  be the  worst there ever was. We shall  wish  we were down a deep 
line 35580=>hole, not just stuck  under a hedge.' He listened. `What's that? Thunder, or  
line 35581=>drums, or what is it? ' 
line 35582=>     'I don't know,' said  Frodo. `It's been going on for a good while  now.  
line 35583=>Sometimes the ground seems  to  tremble, sometimes it seems to be  the heavy 
line 35584=>air throbbing in your ears.' 
line 35585=>     Sam looked  round.  `Where's Gollum?  ' he said. 'Hasn't he  come  back  
line 35586=>yet?' 
line 35587=>     `No,' said Frodo. `There's not been a sign or sound of him.' 
line 35588=>     `Well,  I  can't abide  him,'  said  Sam.  `In fact,  I've  never taken 
line 35589=>anything on a journey that I'd have been less sorry to lose  on the way. But 
line 35590=>it  would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to go and get lost  
line 35591=>now, just when we shall need him most  --  that is, if he's ever going  to be 
line 35592=>any use, which I doubt.' 
line 35593=>     `You forget the Marshes,' said Frodo.  `I hope nothing has happened  to 
line 35594=>him.' 
line 35595=>     `And I hope he's  up to  no  tricks. And anyway I  hope he doesn't fall 
line 35596=>into other hands, as you might say. Because if he does, we  shall soon be in 
line 35597=>for trouble.' 
line 35598=>     At that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again, louder now 
line 35599=>and deeper. The ground seemed to quiver under their feet. 'I think we are in 
line 35600=>
line 35601=>####-for trouble anyhow,' said Frodo. `I'm  afraid our journey  is  drawing to an 
line 35602=>end.' 
line 35603=>     'Maybe,' said Sam;  `but  where there's life there's hope, as my Gaffer  
line 35604=>used to say;  and need of vittles, as he  mostways used to  add. You  have a  
line 35605=>bite, Mr. Frodo, and then a bit of sleep.' 
line 35606=>     The  afternoon, as Sam supposed it must be called, wore on. Looking out 
line 35607=>from the  covert he  could see only a dun, shadowless  world,  fading slowly 
line 35608=>into a featureless,  colourless gloom.  It felt stifling but not warm. Frodo 
line 35609=>slept  unquietly,  turning and  tossing,  and sometimes murmuring. Twice Sam 
line 35610=>thought  he heard him speaking  Gandalf's  name.  The  time  seemed  to drag 
line 35611=>interminably. Suddenly Sam heard a hiss behind him, and  there was Gollum 
line 35612=>on 
line 35613=>all fours, peering at them with gleaming eyes.  
line 35614=>     `Wake up, wake up! Wake up, sleepies!' he whispered. `Wake up!  No time 
line 35615=>to lose. We must go, yes, we must go at once. No time to lose!' 
line 35616=>     Sam stared  at him suspiciously: he  seemed frightened or excited.  `Go 
line 35617=>now? What's your little game?  It isn't time yet. It can't be tea -time even, 
line 35618=>leastways not in decent places where there is tea -time.' 
line 35619=>     `Silly!  ' hissed Gollum. `We're not in  decent places.  Time's running 
line 35620=>short, yes, running fast. No time to lose. We must go. Wake up. Master, wake 
line 35621=>u He clawed at Frodo; and  Frodo, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and 
line 35622=>seized him by the arm. Gollum tore h imself loose and backed away. 
line 35623=>     'They mustn't  be silly,' he hissed. `We must go. No time to lose!' And 
line 35624=>nothing more could  they  get  out of him. Where he  had been, and  what  he 
line 35625=>thought was brewing to make  him in  such a hurry, he would not say. Sam was 
line 35626=>filled with deep suspicion,  and showed it; but  Frodo gave no sign  of what 
line 35627=>was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out 
line 35628=>into the ever -gathering darkness.  
line 35629=>     Very stealthily  Gollum led them down the hillside, keeping under cover  
line 35630=>wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any 
line 35631=>open space; but the light was now so dim that even  a keen-eyed beast of the 
line 35632=>wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their grey cloaks, nor  
line 35633=>heard them,  walking as warily as the little people can. Without the crack of 
line 35634=>a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished. 
line 35635=>     For about an hour they went on, silently, in  single file, oppressed by 
line 35636=>the gloom and by the  absolute stillness  of the land,  broken only now  and 
line 35637=>again  by the  faint rumbling as  of thunder far away or  drum-beats in some  
line 35638=>
line 35639=>####-hollow  of  the hills.  Down  from their hiding-place  they  went,  and then 
line 35640=>turning  south they steered as straight a course as Gollum could find across 
line 35641=>a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains. Presently, not far  
line 35642=>ahead, looming up  like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. As they drew 
line 35643=>nearer they  became aware  that  these were of vast  size,  very  ancient it 
line 35644=>seemed, and still towering high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as 
line 35645=>if tempest and lightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill 
line 35646=>them or to shake their fathomless roots.  
line 35647=>     'The Cross-roads, yes,' whispered Gollum, the first words that had been 
line 35648=>spoken  since they left  their hiding-place. 'We must go  that way.' Turning 
line 35649=>eastward  now, he led them up  the slope;  and  then suddenly  there  it was 
line 35650=>before them: the Southward Road, winding its way about the outer feet of the 
line 35651=>mountains, until presently it plunged  into the great ring of trees.  
line 35652=>     'This is the only way,' whispered Gollum. 'No paths beyond the road. No 
line 35653=>paths. We must go to the Cross-roads. But make haste! Be silent! ' 
line 35654=>     As furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they crept 
line 35655=>down on to the road, and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank, 
line 35656=>grey as the stones themselves,  and soft -footed  as hunting cats.  At length 
line 35657=>they reached the trees, and found that they stood in a great  roofless ring, 
line 35658=>open in  the middle to the sombre sky; and the spaces between  their immense 
line 35659=>boles  were  like the great  dark arches of  some  ruined  hall. In the very 
line 35660=>centre four ways met. Behind them lay the road to the  Morannon; before them 
line 35661=>it ran out again upon its  long journey south; to their right the road  from 
line 35662=>old  Osgiliath  came  climbing up,  and crossing,  passed out eastward  into 
line 35663=>darkness: the fourth way, the road they were to take. 
line 35664=>     Standing there for a moment filled with dread Frodo became aware that a  
line 35665=>light was shining;  he  saw it  glowing  on  Sam's face beside  him. Turning 
line 35666=>towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to  Osgiliath running  
line 35667=>almost as straight  as  a stretched ribbon down, down, into the West. There, 
line 35668=>far away, beyond sad Gondor now overwhelmed in shade,  the  Sun was 
line 35669=>sinking, 
line 35670=>finding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling 
line 35671=>in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied Sea. The brief glow fell upon a  
line 35672=>huge sitting  figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. 
line 35673=>The years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, 
line 35674=>and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted 
line 35675=>by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in 
line 35676=>
line 35677=>####-the midst  of  its forehead. Upon its knees and mighty chair,  and all about 
line 35678=>the pedestal,  were idle  scrawls  mixed  with  the foul  symbols  that  the 
line 35679=>maggot-folk of Mordor used. 
line 35680=>     Suddenly, caught by the level beams,  Frodo saw the old king's head: it 
line 35681=>was lying rolled away by the  roadside. `Look, Sam!' he cried, startled into 
line 35682=>speech. `Look! The king has got a crown again!' 
line 35683=>     The eyes  were hollow and the  carven  beard was  broken, but about the 
line 35684=>high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant 
line 35685=>with flowers like small white stars had bound  itself across the brows as if 
line 35686=>in reverence for the fallen king,  and in the crevices  of  his  stony  hair 
line 35687=>yellow stonecrop gleamed. 
line 35688=>     'They cannot conquer for ever!' said Frodo. And then suddenly the brief 
line 35689=>glimpse was gone. The Sun dipped and vanished, and  as if at the  shuttering 
line 35690=>of a lamp, black night fell. 
line 35691=> 
line 35692=>
line 35693=>####- 
line 35694=>
line 35695=>Chapter 8. The Stairs of Cirith Ungol 
line 35696=>
line 35697=> 
line 35698=> 
line 35699=>     Gollum  was  tugging  at  Frodo's  cloak  and  hissing  with  fear  and 
line 35700=>impatience. `We must go,' he said. `We mustn't stand here. Make haste!' 
line 35701=>     Reluctantly Frodo turned his back on the West and followed as his guide 
line 35702=>led  him, out into the darkness of the East. They left the ring of trees and 
line 35703=>crept along the road towards the mountains. This road, too, ran straight for  
line 35704=>a while,  but  soon it began to  bend  away southwards,  until it came right 
line 35705=>under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. Black  
line 35706=>and  forbidding  it  loomed  above them, darker  than the  dark  sky behind. 
line 35707=>Crawl ing  under  its shadow the road  went on,  and rounding it sprang  east  
line 35708=>again and began to climb steeply. 
line 35709=>     Frodo and Sam were  plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to  
line 35710=>care greatly  about  their  peril. Frodo's head  was  bowed; his burden  was 
line 35711=>dragging him down again. As soon as the great  Cross-roads  had been passed, 
line 35712=>the weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien, had begun to grow once more. 
line 35713=>Now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and 
line 35714=>then he  saw  it, even  as Gollum  had said  that he would: the city of  the 
line 35715=>Ringwraiths. He cowered against the stony bank. 
line 35716=>     A long-tilted  valley, a  deep gulf of shadow,  ran back far  into  the 
line 35717=>mountains. Upon the further side, some way  within the valley's arms high on 
line 35718=>a  rocky seat upon the black knees  of  the Ephel D®ath, stood the walls and  
line 35719=>tower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it  was lit 
line 35720=>with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of 
line 35721=>Minas  Ithil long ago, Tower of the  Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of 
line 35722=>the hills. Paler  indeed than  the moon ailing in some  slow eclipse was the 
line 35723=>light of it now, wavering and blowing like a  noisome exhalation of decay, a  
line 35724=>corpse-light, a light that  illuminated  nothing.  In  the  walls  and tower  
line 35725=>windows showed, like countless black holes  looking inward  into  emptiness;  
line 35726=>but  the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then 
line 35727=>another, a huge ghostly head  leering into the night. For a moment the three 
line 35728=>companions  stood there, shrinking,  staring  up with unwilling eyes. Gollum 
line 35729=>was the first to recover. Again he pulled  at their cloaks urgently,  but he 
line 35730=>spoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and 
line 35731=>time seemed to slow its pace. so that between the raising of a foot  and the 
line 35732=>
line 35733=>####-setting of it down minutes of loathing passed. 
line 35734=>     So they came  slowly  to the  white  bridge.  Here  the  road, gleaming 
line 35735=>faintly,  passed over the  stream  in the midst of the valley, and went  on, 
line 35736=>winding  deviously up towards the city's gate: a black  mouth opening in the 
line 35737=>outer circle of the  northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy 
line 35738=>meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and 
line 35739=>yet horrible of shape, like the demented  forms in an uneasy dream; and they  
line 35740=>gave forth a  faint sickening charnel-smell; an  odour  of rottenness filled 
line 35741=>the  air. From  mead to mead  the  bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its 
line 35742=>head, carven  with cunning  in forms human  and bestial, but all corrupt and  
line 35743=>loathsome.  The water flowing  beneath was  silent, and  it steamed, but the 
line 35744=>vapour that  rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly 
line 35745=>cold. Frodo felt his senses  reeling and his mind darkening. Then  suddenly, 
line 35746=>as if some force were  at work other than his own will, he began  to  hurry, 
line 35747=>tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to 
line 35748=>side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his  master in his arms,  
line 35749=>as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge. 
line 35750=>     `Not  that way! No, not that  way! '  whispered  Gollum, but the breath 
line 35751=>between  his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he 
line 35752=>cowered to the ground in terror. 
line 35753=>     `Hold  up,  Mr. Frodo! ' muttered Sam  in  Frodo's ear. 'Come back! Not 
line 35754=>that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him.' 
line 35755=>     Frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the 
line 35756=>city  on the  hill.  The luminous  tower fascinated him,  and he fought  the 
line 35757=>desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last  
line 35758=>with an effort he turned back, and as  he did so, he felt the Ring resisting 
line 35759=>him, dragging  at the chain about his  neck; and his  eyes too, as he looked 
line 35760=>away, seemed for the moment to  have  been blinded.  The darkness before him 
line 35761=>was impenetrable. 
line 35762=>     Gollum, crawling on  the ground like  a frightened animal, was  already 
line 35763=>vanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his  stumbling master, 
line 35764=>followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the  
line 35765=>stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this  they 
line 35766=>passed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow  path that gleamed faintly at 
line 35767=>first, as  the main road  did,  until  climb ing  above  the meads of  deadly 
line 35768=>flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern 
line 35769=>sides of the valley. 
line 35770=>
line 35771=>####-     Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum 
line 35772=>in front of  them, except when  he turned back to  beckon them  on. Then his 
line 35773=>eyes  shone  with  a green-white light, reflecting  the noisome Morgul-sheen 
line 35774=>perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam  and 
line 35775=>of  the dark eyeholes Frodo  and Sam  were  always conscious,  ever glancing 
line 35776=>fearfully over their shoulders,  and  ever dragging their eyes  back to find 
line 35777=>the darkening path. Slowly  they laboured on. As they rose  above the stench  
line 35778=>and vapours of  the poisonous stream their  breath  became easier and  their 
line 35779=>heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as  if they had walked 
line 35780=>all night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy  tide of 
line 35781=>water. At last they could go no further without a halt. 
line 35782=>     Frodo stopped and  sat down on a stone. They had now climbed up  to the 
line 35783=>top  of  a  great  hump of bare rock.  Ahead of them  there was a bay in the 
line 35784=>valley-side, and  round the  head of this  the path  went on, no more than a  
line 35785=>wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the 
line 35786=>mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above. 
line 35787=>     `I  must rest a  while, Sam,' whispered Frodo. `It's heavy  on me,  Sam 
line 35788=>lad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry  it? Anyway I must rest before 
line 35789=>we venture on to that.' He pointed to the narrow way ahead. 
line 35790=>     `Sssh! ssh! ' hissed Gollum hurrying back to them. `Sssh! ' His fingers 
line 35791=>were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging  at Frodo's sleeve,  
line 35792=>he pointed towards the path; but Frodo would not move. 
line 35793=>     `Not  yet,' he  said,  'not  yet.' Weariness and  more  than  weariness 
line 35794=>oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind  and body. 
line 35795=>`I must rest,' he muttered. 
line 35796=>     At  this  Gollum's fear  and  agitation became so  great that he  spoke 
line 35797=>again,  hissing  behind  his hand, as  if to  keep  the  sound  from  unseen 
line 35798=>listeners  in the air. `Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! Eyes can see us. 
line 35799=>When they come  to the  bridge they will see  us. Come away!  Climb,  climb!  
line 35800=>Come!  ' 
line 35801=>     `Come, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. `He's right, again. We can't stay here.' 
line 35802=>     'All  right,'  said Frodo  in a  remote voice, as of one  speaking half 
line 35803=>asleep. `I will try.' Wearily he got to his feet. 
line 35804=>     But  it  was too  late.  At that moment the rock quivered  and trembled 
line 35805=>beneath them. The  great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled  in 
line 35806=>the ground and echoed in the mountains.  Then  with searing suddenness there 
line 35807=>came a great red flash. Far beyond the eastern  mountains it leapt into  the 
line 35808=>
line 35809=>####-sky and splashed the lowering clouds with cr imson.  In that valley of shadow 
line 35810=>and  cold deathly light it  seemed  unbearably violent  and fierce. Peaks of 
line 35811=>stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the 
line 35812=>uprushing flame in Gorgoroth. Then came a great crack of thunder. 
line 35813=>     And Minas Morgul answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks 
line 35814=>of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into 
line 35815=>the sullen clouds. The earth groaned; and out of the city there came  a cry. 
line 35816=>Mingled  with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the shrill neighing 
line 35817=>of horses wild with rage  and fear, there came a rending screech, shivering, 
line 35818=>rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing.  The hobbits 
line 35819=>wheeled round towards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon 
line 35820=>their ears. 
line 35821=>     As the terrible cry ended, falling back  through a long sickening  wail 
line 35822=>to  silence, Frodo slowly  raised his head.  Across the  narrow  valley, now 
line 35823=>almost on  a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood ,  and its 
line 35824=>cavernous  gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming  teeth,  was gaping 
line 35825=>wide. And out of the gate an army came. 
line 35826=>     All that  host  was clad in  sable, dark  as the night. Against the wan 
line 35827=>walls and  the luminous pavement  of  the  road Frodo could  see them, small 
line 35828=>black figures in rank upon rank,  marching  swiftly  and  silently,  passing 
line 35829=>outwards in  an endless stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen 
line 35830=>moving like  ordered shadows, and at their head was one greater than all the 
line 35831=>rest: a Rider, all black, save that on his  hooded head he had a helm like a  
line 35832=>crown that  flickered with  a  perilous  light.  Now he was drawing near the 
line 35833=>bridge below,  and Frodo's staring eyes followed him,  unable to  wink or to 
line 35834=>withdraw. Surely there was the Lord of the  Nine Riders returned to earth to 
line 35835=>lead his ghastly  host to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king 
line 35836=>whose cold  hand had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife. The 
line 35837=>old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo's heart. 
line 35838=>     Even  as these thoughts  pierced him with dread  and held him  bound as 
line 35839=>with a  spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right  before the  entrance of the 
line 35840=>bridge, and behind him all the host stood still. There was  a pause, a  dead 
line 35841=>silence. Maybe it was  the Ring that called  to the  Wraith-lord, and for  a  
line 35842=>moment he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley. This way 
line 35843=>and that turned the dark head helmed  and  crowned  with  fear, sweeping the 
line 35844=>shadows with its unseen eyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a  
line 35845=>snake,  unable to move.  And  as  he  waited, he felt, more urgent than ever  
line 35846=>
line 35847=>####-before,  the command  that  he  should  put on  the Ring.  But great as  the 
line 35848=>pressure was, he felt no  inclination now to yield to it. He  knew that  the 
line 35849=>Ring would only betray him, and that he had not, even if  he  put it on, the 
line 35850=>power  to face the  Morgul-king-not yet. There was no  longer any  answer to 
line 35851=>that command in his own will,  dismayed by terror though it was, and he  felt 
line 35852=>only the  beating upon him of a  great power from outside. It took his hand, 
line 35853=>and as Frodo watched with his mind, not willing it but in suspense (as if he 
line 35854=>looked on some  old story far  away), it moved the hand inch by inch towards 
line 35855=>the chain upon his neck. Then his  own will stirred;  slowly  it forced  the 
line 35856=>hand  back. and  set it to find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his 
line 35857=>breast. Cold and  hard it  seemed as  his  grip closed on it:  the  phial of 
line 35858=>Galadriel, so long  treasured, and  almost forgotten till  that hour.  As he 
line 35859=>touched it, for a while all thought of the Ring was banished from his  mind. 
line 35860=>He sighed and bent his head. 
line 35861=>     At  that moment the Wraith-king  turned and spurred  his horse and rode 
line 35862=>across the bridge, and all his dark host followed him. Maybe the elven-hoods 
line 35863=>defied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small enemy; being strengthened, 
line 35864=>had turned  aside his thought.  But  he  was  in haste. Already the hour had 
line 35865=>struck,  and at his great Master's  bidding he must march with  war into the 
line 35866=>West. 
line 35867=>     Soon he had passed, like a shadow  into shadow, down  the winding road, 
line 35868=>and  behind  him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So great an  army 
line 35869=>had never issued from that vale since the  days of  Isildur's might; no host  
line 35870=>so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet  it 
line 35871=>was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth. 
line 35872=>     Frodo  stirred. And suddenly  his heart went out to Faramir. 'The storm 
line 35873=>has burst at last,' he thought. `This great  array of spears  and  swords is 
line 35874=>going to Osgiliath. Will Faramir get across in time? He  guessed it, but did 
line 35875=>he know the hour? And  who can now hold  the fords when the King of the 
line 35876=>Nine 
line 35877=>Riders comes? And  other armies will  come.  I  am too late. All is lost.  I 
line 35878=>tarried on the way. All is lost. Even if my errand is performed, no one will 
line 35879=>ever know. There will be  no one  I can  tell. It will be in vain.' Overcome 
line 35880=>with weakness he wept. And still the host of Morgul crossed the bridge. 
line 35881=>     Then at a  great distance, as if it  came out of memories of  the Shire, 
line 35882=>some sunlit early morning,  when  the  day called and doors were opening, he 
line 35883=>heard  Sam's voice  speaking. `Wake up, Mr. Frodo!  Wake up! ' Had the voice 
line 35884=>
line 35885=>####-added:  `Your breakfast is  ready,' he  would hardly  have  been  surprised. 
line 35886=>Certainly Sam was urgent. `Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone,' he said. 
line 35887=>     There was  a dull clang. The gates of Minas Morgul had closed. The last 
line 35888=>rank of spears had  vanished down  the road. The tower still grinned  across 
line 35889=>the valley, but the light was fading  in it. The whole city was falling back  
line 35890=>into  a  dark brooding  shade,  and  silence.  Yet still it was filled  with 
line 35891=>watchfulness.  
line 35892=>     'Wake  up,  Mr. Frodo!  They're gone, and  we'd better  go too. There's 
line 35893=>something still alive in that place, something with eyes,  or a seeing mind, 
line 35894=>if you take  me; and the  longer we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get 
line 35895=>on to us. Come on, Mr. Frodo! ' 
line 35896=>     Frodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but 
line 35897=>the weakness had  passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a 
line 35898=>moment before he had  felt the opposite,  that  what he had to do, he had to 
line 35899=>do, if he could, and that whether  Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel  
line 35900=>or Gandalf or anyone e lse ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took 
line 35901=>his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear 
line 35902=>light was already welling through his fingers, he  thrust it into his  bosom 
line 35903=>and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul,  now no 
line 35904=>more  than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward 
line 35905=>road. 
line 35906=>     Gollum, it  seemed,  had  crawled off along the ledge into the darkness 
line 35907=>beyond, when the  gates  of Minas  Morgul  opened, leaving the hobbits where 
line 35908=>they  lay. He now came creeping back, his  teeth chattering and his  fingers 
line 35909=>snapping. `Foolish!  Silly!  '  he hissed. `Make haste!  They  mustn't think  
line 35910=>danger has passed. It hasn't. Make haste!  ' 
line 35911=>     They did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It 
line 35912=>was little to the liking of either of  them, not even  after facing so  many 
line 35913=>other perils; but it did not  last  long.  Soon the  path reached a  rounded 
line 35914=>angle  where  the  mountain-side  swelled out  again, and  there it suddenly 
line 35915=>entered a narrow  opening in the rock. They had come to the first stair that 
line 35916=>Gollum had spoken of. The  darkness  was almost complete, and they could see 
line 35917=>nothing  much  beyond their hands' stretch; but  Gollum's  eyes shone  pale, 
line 35918=>several feet above, as he turned back towards them. 
line 35919=>     `Careful! ' he whispered. `Steps. Lots of steps. Must be careful! ' 
line 35920=>     Care was certainly needed. Frodo and  Sam at  first felt easier, having 
line 35921=>now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder , 
line 35922=>
line 35923=>####-and as they climbed up and  up, they became more  and more aware of the long 
line 35924=>black fall  behind them.  And the steps  were narrow,  spaced unevenly,  and 
line 35925=>often treacherous: they  were worn and  smooth at  the  edges, and some were 
line 35926=>broken, and  some cracked  as foot was set  upon them. The hobbits struggled 
line 35927=>on,  until at last they  were  clinging with  desperate fingers to the steps 
line 35928=>ahead, and forcing their  aching knees  to bend and  straighten; and ever as 
line 35929=>the stair cut its way deeper  into the  sheer mountain the rocky walls  rose 
line 35930=>higher and higher above their heads.  
line 35931=>     At  length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they  saw 
line 35932=>Gollum's  eyes peering  down at them again. `We're up,' he whispered. 'First  
line 35933=>stair's past. Clever hobbits to  climb so high, very  clever hobbits. Just a  
line 35934=>few more little steps and that's all, yes.' 
line 35935=>     Dizzy and very  tired Sam, and Frodo following him, crawled up the last  
line 35936=>step, and sat down rubbing their legs  and knees. They were in  a  deep dark 
line 35937=>passage that seemed still to go  up before  them,  though at a gentler slope 
line 35938=>and without steps. Gollum did not let them rest long. 
line 35939=>     'There's another stair still,' he said. `Much  longer stair. Rest  when 
line 35940=>we get to the top of next stair. Not yet.' 
line 35941=>     Sam groaned. 'Longer, did you say? ' he asked. 
line 35942=>     'Yes, yess, longer,' said Gollum. `But not  so  difficult. Hobbits have 
line 35943=>climbed the Straight Stair. Next comes the Winding Stair.' 
line 35944=>     'And what after that? ' said Sam. 
line 35945=>     `We shall see,' said Gollum softly. `O yes, we shall see!  ' 
line 35946=>     'I thought you said there  was  a  tunnel,' said  Sam.  `Isn't  there a  
line 35947=>tunnel or something to go through? ' 
line 35948=>     'O yes,  there's a tunnel,' said Gollum. `But hobbits  can rest  before 
line 35949=>they try that. If they get through that,  they'll be nearly at the top. Very 
line 35950=>nearly, if they get through. O yes! ' 
line 35951=>     Frodo shivered. The climb had made him sweat, but now  he felt cold and 
line 35952=>clammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from 
line 35953=>the invisible  heights above. He got up and shook himself.  `Well, let's  go 
line 35954=>on! ' he said. `This is no place to sit in.' 
line 35955=>     The passage seemed to go on  for miles, and always the chill air flowed 
line 35956=>over them, rising as they went on to  a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to 
line 35957=>be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the  
line 35958=>secrets of the high places,  or to blow them away  into the darkness behind. 
line 35959=>They only knew  that  they had come  to the end, when suddenly  they felt no 
line 35960=>
line 35961=>####-wall at their right hand. They  could see very little. Great black shapeless 
line 35962=>masses and deep  grey shadows loomed above  them and about them, but now 
line 35963=>and 
line 35964=>again a dull  red light flickered up under  the lowering  clouds, and for  a  
line 35965=>moment  they were aware of  tall peaks, in  front  and on  either side, like 
line 35966=>pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They  seemed to have climbed up many 
line 35967=>hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their  left and a chasm 
line 35968=>on their right. 
line 35969=>     Gollum led the way close under the cliff.  For the present they were no 
line 35970=>longer climbing, but the  ground  was now more broken  and  dangerous in the 
line 35971=>dark, and there  were blocks and  lumps of fallen stone  in the  way.  Their 
line 35972=>going  was slow and  cautious.  How  many hours  had  passed  since they had 
line 35973=>entered the  Morgul Vale  neither Sam nor Frodo could  any longer guess. The 
line 35974=>night seemed endless. 
line 35975=>     At length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more 
line 35976=>a stairway opened before them. Again  they halted, and  again they  began to  
line 35977=>climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this  stairway did not delve into 
line 35978=>the  mountain-side. Here  the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path 
line 35979=>like  a  snake wound  to and fro across it. At one point it crawled sideways 
line 35980=>right to the  edge of the dark chasm, and Frodo  glancing down saw below him 
line 35981=>as  a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the Morgul Valley.  Down 
line 35982=>in  its depths glimmered like  a glow-worm thread the  wraith-road from  the 
line 35983=>dead city to the Nameless Pass. He turned hastily away. 
line 35984=>     Still  on and up the  stairway bent and  crawled, until  at last with a  
line 35985=>final flight, short  and straight, it climbed out again on to another level. 
line 35986=>The  path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now 
line 35987=>followed  its own  perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the 
line 35988=>higher  regions  of  the Ephel D®ath. Dimly  the hobbits could  discern tall 
line 35989=>piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side, between which were great 
line 35990=>crevices  and fissures blacker than  the night, where  forgotten winter s had 
line 35991=>gnawed and carved the sunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed 
line 35992=>stronger; though they could not tell whether a  dreadful morning were indeed 
line 35993=>coming to this place of shadow, or whether  they saw only the flame of  some 
line 35994=>great violence  of  Sauron in  the torment  of Gorgoroth  beyond.  Still far 
line 35995=>ahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very 
line 35996=>crown of  this  bitter road. Against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a  
line 35997=>cleft was outlined  in  the topmost ridge,  narrow, deep-cloven between  two 
line 35998=>
line 35999=>####-black shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone. 
line 36000=>     He paused  and looked more attentively. The horn upon the left was tall 
line 36001=>and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land 
line 36002=>beyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it  was a black  tower poised 
line 36003=>above the outer pass. He touched Sam's arm and pointed. 
line 36004=>     'I  don't like the look of that! ' said Sam.  `So  this secret  way  of 
line 36005=>yours is guarded after all,' he growled, turning to Gollum. 'As you knew all 
line 36006=>along, I suppose? ' 
line 36007=>     'All ways  are watched, yes,' said Gollum.  `Of  course they  are.  But 
line 36008=>hobbits must  try  some way. This may  be least watched. Perhaps they've all  
line 36009=>gone away to big battle, perhaps! ' 
line 36010=>     'Perhaps,' grunted Sam.  'Well, it  still  seems a long  way off, and a  
line 36011=>long way  up before we get there. And there's still the tunnel. I think  you  
line 36012=>ought to rest now,  Mr. Frodo. I don't know what time of day or night it is, 
line 36013=>but we've kept going for hours and hours.' 
line 36014=>     `Yes, we must  rest,' said Frodo. 'Let us find some corner out  of  the 
line 36015=>wind, and gather our  strength-for  the last lap.' For so  he felt it to be. 
line 36016=>The  terrors of  the land  beyond, and  the deed to  be  done there,  seemed 
line 36017=>remote, too  far off yet to  trouble  him. All his mind  was bent on getting 
line 36018=>through or over this impenetrable wall and guard.  If once he could do  that 
line 36019=>impossible thing, then  somehow the errand would be  accomplished, or so  it 
line 36020=>seemed to him in that  dark hour of weariness, still  labouring in the stony 
line 36021=>shadows under Cirith Ungol. 
line 36022=>     In a dark crevice between two great piers of rock they sat down:  Frodo 
line 36023=>and  Sam a  little  way within. and Gollum crouched upon the ground near the 
line 36024=>opening. There the hobbits took what  they expected would be their last meal 
line 36025=>before they went down into the Nameless Land, maybe the last meal they 
line 36026=>would 
line 36027=>ever  eat together. Some of the food  of Gondor they ate, and  wafers of the 
line 36028=>waybread of the Elves. and they drank a little. But of their water they were 
line 36029=>sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths. 
line 36030=>     `I wonder when we'll find water again? ' said Sam. 'But I suppose  even 
line 36031=>over there they drink? Orcs drink, don't they? ' 
line 36032=>     'Yes,  they drink,' said Frodo. 'But do not let  us speak of that. Such 
line 36033=>drink is not for us.' 
line 36034=>     `Then  all  the  more need  to fill our bottles,' said  Sam. `But there 
line 36035=>isn't any water up here: not  a sound or a trickle  have I heard. And anyway 
line 36036=>
line 36037=>####-Faramir said we were not to drink any water in Morgul.' 
line 36038=>     'No water flowing out of Imlad Morgul, were his words,' said Frodo. `We 
line 36039=>are not in that valley now, and if we came  on a spring  it would be flowing 
line 36040=>into it and not out of it.' 
line 36041=>     'I  wouldn't  trust  it,' said Sam, 'not  till  I was dying  of thirst. 
line 36042=>There's a  wicked feeling  about this  place.' He  sniffed. 'And  a smell, I 
line 36043=>fancy. Do you notice it? A queer kind of a smell, stuffy. I don't like it.' 
line 36044=>     'I don't like anything here at all.' said Frodo, `step or stone, breath 
line 36045=>or bone. Earth, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.' 
line 36046=>     'Yes, that's so,'  said Sam. `And we shouldn't be here at all,  if we'd 
line 36047=>known more about it before we started. But I  suppose  it's often  that way. 
line 36048=>The brave things  in the old  tales and songs,  Mr. Frodo: adventures,  as I 
line 36049=>used to call them. I used to think that they were things  the wonderful folk  
line 36050=>of the stories  went out and looked  for,  because they wanted them, because 
line 36051=>they were exciting and  life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might 
line 36052=>say. But that's not the  way of it with the tales  that  really mattered, or  
line 36053=>the  ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, 
line 36054=>usually -- their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But  I expect they 
line 36055=>had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they 
line 36056=>had, we  shouldn't know, because they'd have  been  forgotten. We hear about 
line 36057=>those as just went on  -- and not all to a  good end, mind you; at least not 
line 36058=>to what  folk  inside a story and not outside it call a good  end. You know,  
line 36059=>coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same  -- like 
line 36060=>old Mr Bilbo.  But those aren't always  the best tales to  hear, though they 
line 36061=>may be the  best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale  we've 
line 36062=>fallen into?  ' 
line 36063=>     `I wonder,' said Frodo. 'But I don't know. And that's the way of a real 
line 36064=>tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of 
line 36065=>a  tale it is, happy -ending or sad-ending, but the people  in it don't know.  
line 36066=>And you don't want them to.' 
line 36067=>     'No, sir, of course not. Beren now,  he  never thought he was  going to 
line 36068=>get that Silmaril from the  Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did,  and 
line 36069=>that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours.  But  that's  a  long 
line 36070=>tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it 
line 36071=>-- and the  Silmaril  went  on and  came to Edrendil. And why, sir, I  never  
line 36072=>thought of that before! We've got  -- you've got some  of  the light of it in 
line 36073=>that star-glass  that the Lady gave you! Why,   to  think of it, we're in the 
line 36074=>
line 36075=>####-same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end? ' 
line 36076=>     'No, they  never  end  as  tales,' said Frodo.  `But the people in them 
line 36077=>come, and go when their part's ended. Our part will end later  -- or sooner.' 
line 36078=>     'And then we can have some rest and  some sleep,' said Sam.  He laughed  
line 36079=>grimly.  'And I  mean just  that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain ordinary rest, and 
line 36080=>sleep, and  waking up  to a morning's work in the garden. I'm afraid  that's 
line 36081=>all I'm hoping for all the time. All the big important  plans are not for my 
line 36082=>sort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs  or tales. We're in 
line 36083=>one,  or course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside, 
line 36084=>or read out of a great big book with red  and black letters, years and years 
line 36085=>afterwards. And people will say: "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring! " And 
line 36086=>they'll say: "Yes, that's one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave. 
line 36087=>wasn't he, dad?"  "Yes, my boy, the  famousest of  the hobbits,  and  that's 
line 36088=>saying a lot."' 
line 36089=>     `It's saying a lot too much,' said Frodo, and he laughed,  a long clear 
line 36090=>laugh from  his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since 
line 36091=>Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the  stones 
line 36092=>were listen ing and the  tall rocks leaning over them. But Frodo did not heed 
line 36093=>them;  he laughed again. 'Why, Sam,' he said, 'to hear you somehow makes  me 
line 36094=>as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the 
line 36095=>chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. "I  want to hear more about Sam, 
line 36096=>dad. Why  didn't they put  in more of his talk, dad? That's  what I like, it 
line 36097=>makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have  got far without Sam, would he, 
line 36098=>dad? 
line 36099=>"  ' 
line 36100=>     `Now, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was serious. ' 
line 36101=>     `So  was I,' said Frodo, 'and so I am. We're  going on a bit  too fast. 
line 36102=>You and I, Sam, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it  is 
line 36103=>all too likely that some will say at this point: "Shut the book now, dad; we 
line 36104=>don't want to read any more." ' 
line 36105=>     `Maybe,' said Sam, 'but I wouldn't be one to say that.  Things done and 
line 36106=>over and made into part of the great  tales are  different. Why, even Gollum 
line 36107=>might be  good in a  tale,  better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he 
line 36108=>used to like  tales himself once, by his own  account. I wonder if he thinks 
line 36109=>he's the hero or the villain?  
line 36110=>     `Gollum!' he called. `Would  you like to be the hero  -- now where's  he 
line 36111=>got to again?' 
line 36112=>
line 36113=>####-     There was no  sign of  him at  the mouth  of their shelter nor  in  the 
line 36114=>shadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a  
line 36115=>mouthful of water; and then  he had seemed to curl up for a sleep:  They had 
line 36116=>supposed that one at any  rate of his objects  in his  long absence  the day 
line 36117=>befor e had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently 
line 36118=>slipped off again while they talked. But what for this time?  
line 36119=>     `I don't like his sneaking off without saying,' said Sam. 'And least of 
line 36120=>all now. He can't  be looking for food up here, not unless there's some kind 
line 36121=>of rock he fancies. Why, there isn't even a bit of moss! ' 
line 36122=>     `It's no  good worrying about him now,'  said  Frodo. `We couldn't have 
line 36123=>got so  far,  not even within  sight of the pass, without  him, and so we'll 
line 36124=>have to put up with his ways. If he's false, he's false.' 
line 36125=>     'All the same, I'd  rather have  him under  my eye,' said Sam. 'All the 
line 36126=>more so, if  he's false. Do you remember he never would say if this pass was 
line 36127=>guarded or no? And now we see a  tower there -- and it may be deserted,  and 
line 36128=>it may  not. Do  you think he's gone to fetch  them, Orcs  or  whatever they 
line 36129=>are?' 
line 36130=>     `No,  I  don't  think  so,'  answered Frodo.  'Even if he's up  to some 
line 36131=>wickedness, and I suppose that's not unlikely, I don't think it's  that: no t 
line 36132=>to  fetch Orcs,  or  any servants of the  Enemy.  Why wait till now,  and go 
line 36133=>through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land  he fears? He 
line 36134=>could probably have  betrayed us to Orcs many times since we met him. No, if 
line 36135=>it's  anything,  it wil l  be some  little private trick of  his  own-that he 
line 36136=>thinks is quite secret.' 
line 36137=>     `Well,  I suppose  you're  right, Mr.  Frodo,'  said Sam.  'Not that it 
line 36138=>comforts me mightily. I don't make no  mistake:  I  don't doubt he'd hand me  
line 36139=>over  to Orcs  as  gladly  as kiss  his hand.  But  I was forgetting --  his 
line 36140=>Precious. No, I  suppose the  whole  time it's  been The  Precious for  poor 
line 36141=>Smjagol. That's the one idea in  all his little schemes, if he has any.  But 
line 36142=>how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than I can guess.' 
line 36143=>     'Very  likely  he can't guess himself,' said Frodo. `And I don't  think  
line 36144=>he's got just  one plain scheme in his muddled head. I think he really is in 
line 36145=>part trying to save the Precious from the Enemy. as long as he can. For that 
line 36146=>would be the last  disaster for himself too. if the Enemy got it. And in the 
line 36147=>other part, perhaps, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance.' 
line 36148=>     'Yes, Slinker  and Stinker, as I've said before,'  said  Sam.  'But the 
line 36149=>nearer they get to the  Enemy's land the more like Stinker Slinker will get. 
line 36150=>
line 36151=>####-Mark my words: if ever we get to the pass, he  won't let us really take  the 
line 36152=>precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble.' 
line 36153=>     `We haven't got there yet,' said Frodo. 
line 36154=>     'No, but we'd better keep our eyes skinned till we do.  If we're caught 
line 36155=>napping, Stinker will come out on top pretty quick. Not but what it would be 
line 36156=>safe for you to have a wink now, master.  Safe, if you lay close  to me. I'd 
line 36157=>be dearly glad to see you have a sleep. I'd keep watch over you; and anyway, 
line 36158=>if you lay near, with my arm round you, no one could come pawing you 
line 36159=>without 
line 36160=>your Sam knowing it.' 
line 36161=>     `Sleep!'  said  Frodo and sighed, as if out of  a desert  he had seen a  
line 36162=>mirage of cool green. 'Yes, even here I could sleep.' 
line 36163=>     `Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.' 
line 36164=>     And so Gollum found  them hours later, when  he returned,  crawling and  
line 36165=>creeping down the path out  of the gloom ahead. Sam sat  propped against the 
line 36166=>stone, his head dropping  sideways and his   breathing heavy. In his  lap lay 
line 36167=>Frodo's head,  drowned deep in  sleep; upon his white  forehead lay  one  of 
line 36168=>Sam's brown hands, and the  other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace 
line 36169=>was in both their faces.  
line 36170=>     Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry 
line 36171=>face.  The gleam faded from his eyes,  and they went dim and grey,  old  and  
line 36172=>tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back 
line 36173=>up towards  the  pass,  shaking  his head, as  if engaged in  some   interior  
line 36174=>debate. Then he came back, and  slowly  putting out  a trembling  hand, very 
line 36175=>cautiously he touched Frodo's knee  -- but almost the touch was a caress. For  
line 36176=>a fleeting moment,  could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have 
line 36177=>thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had 
line 36178=>carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin,  and the fields and 
line 36179=>streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing. 
line 36180=>     But at that touch Frodo stirred and cried out softly in  his sleep, and 
line 36181=>immediately Sam was wide awake. The first thing he saw was Gollum  -- 
line 36182=>`pawing 
line 36183=>at master,' as he thought. 
line 36184=>     `Hey you!' he said roughly. `What are you up to?' 
line 36185=>     'Nothing, nothing,' said Gollum softly. `Nice Master!' 
line 36186=>     `I daresay,' said Sam. 'But where have you been to  -- sneaking off and 
line 36187=>sneaking back, you old villain? ' 
line 36188=>
line 36189=>####-     Gollum withdrew himself, and a green glint  flickered under  his  heavy 
line 36190=>lids. Almost  spider -like  he  looked now, crouched  back on his bent limbs, 
line 36191=>with his  protruding eyes. The fleeting  moment  had  passed, beyond recall.  
line 36192=>`Sneaking,  sneaking!'  he  hissed.  'Hobbits always  so polite, yes. O nice 
line 36193=>hobbits! Smjagol brings them  up secret  ways that  nobody else  could find.  
line 36194=>Tired he is, thirsty  he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches 
line 36195=>for paths, and they say sneak, sneak. Very nice friends,  O yes my precious,  
line 36196=>very nice.' 
line 36197=>     Sam felt  a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. 'Sorry.' he said. 
line 36198=>'I'm sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. And I  shouldn't  have been 
line 36199=>sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp.  But Mr.  Frodo.  he's that tired, I 
line 36200=>asked him to have a wink; and well,  that's how it is. Sorry. But where have 
line 36201=>you been to? ' 
line 36202=>     `Sneaking,' said Gollum, and the green glint did not leave his  eyes. 
line 36203=>     'O very well,' said Sam, `have it your own way! I don't suppose it's so 
line 36204=>far  from the truth. And now  we'd  better all  be  sneaking along together. 
line 36205=>What's the time? Is it today or tomorrow? ' 
line 36206=>     'It's tomorrow,' said Gollum, 'or this  was  tomorrow when hobbits went 
line 36207=>to sleep. Very foolish, very dangerous-if poor Smjagol wasn't sneaking about 
line 36208=>to watch.' 
line 36209=>     `I think we shall  get tired  of that word soon,' said Sam. 'But  never  
line 36210=>mind.  I'll  wake master up.' Gently he smoothed the hair back  fr om Frodo's 
line 36211=>brow, and bending down spoke softly to him. 
line 36212=>     `Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up! ' 
line 36213=>     Frodo stirred  and  opened  his  eyes,  and  smiled, seeing Sam's  face 
line 36214=>bending over him.  `Calling me early  aren't you,  Sam?' he said. `It's dark 
line 36215=>still!  ' 
line 36216=>     'Yes  it's  always  dark here,' said  Sam. `But Gollum's come  back Mr. 
line 36217=>Frodo, and he says it's tomorrow. So we must be walking on. The last lap.' 
line 36218=>     Frodo drew a deep breath  and sat up. `The last lap! ' he said. 'Hullo, 
line 36219=>Smjagol! Found any food? Have you had any rest? ' 
line 36220=>     `No food, no rest, nothing for Smjagol,' said Gollum. `He's a sneak.' 
line 36221=>     Sam clicked his tongue, but restrained himself. 
line 36222=>     'Don't  take  names to  yourself,  Smjagol,'  said Frodo. 'It's  unwise 
line 36223=>whether they are true or false.' 
line 36224=>     `Smjagol has to take what's given  him,' answered Gollum. 'He was given 
line 36225=>that name by kind Master Samwise, the hobbit that knows so much.' 
line 36226=>
line 36227=>####-     Frodo looked at Sam. 'Yes sir,' he said. `I did use the word, waking up 
line 36228=>out of my sleep sudden and all  and finding him at hand. I said I was sorry, 
line 36229=>but I soon shan't be.' 
line 36230=>     'Come, let it pass then,' said Frodo. 'But now we seem to have  come to 
line 36231=>the point, you and  I, Smjagol. Tell me. Can we  find the rest of the way by 
line 36232=>ourselves?  We're in sight of  the pass, of a way in, and  if we can find it 
line 36233=>now, then I suppose our agreement can be said to be over. You have done what 
line 36234=>you promised,  and  you're free: free to go back to food  and rest, wherever  
line 36235=>you wish to  go, except to servants  of the Enemy. And one   day I may reward 
line 36236=>you, I or those that remember me.' 
line 36237=>     `No,  no,  not  yet,'  Gollum whined. `O no!  They  can't  find the way 
line 36238=>themselves, can they? O no indeed. There's the tunnel coming.  Smjagol  must  
line 36239=>go on. No rest. No food. Not yet.' 
line 36240=> 
line 36241=>
line 36242=>####- 
line 36243=>
line 36244=>Chapter 9. Shelob's Lair 
line 36245=>
line 36246=> 
line 36247=> 
line 36248=>     It  may indeed have been  daytime now, as Gollum said, but the  hobbits 
line 36249=>could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above  was  less 
line 36250=>utterly  black,  more like  a  great roof  of smoke; while  instead  of  the 
line 36251=>darkness  of deep night, which lingered still in  cracks and  holes, a  grey 
line 36252=>blurring shadow shrouded the stony world  about them. They passed on, 
line 36253=>Gollum 
line 36254=>in front and the hobbits  now side by side, up the long  ravine  between the 
line 36255=>piers  and columns of torn and wea thered  rock, standing like huge  unshapen 
line 36256=>statues on  either hand. There was no  sound. Some way ahead, a mile  or so,  
line 36257=>perhaps,   was  a  great  grey  wall,  a   last  huge  upthrusting  mass  of 
line 36258=>mountain-stone. Darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as  they  approached, 
line 36259=>until it towered up high above them, shutting  out the view of all that  lay 
line 36260=>beyond. Deep shadow lay before its feet. Sam sniffed the air. 
line 36261=>     `Ugh! That smell!' he said. `It's getting stronger and stronger.' 
line 36262=>     Presently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they 
line 36263=>saw the  opening  of a cave. `This is the way in,' said Gollum softly. `This 
line 36264=>is  the entrance to the tunnel.' He did  not speak its name:  Torech  Ungol, 
line 36265=>Shelob's Lair. Out of it came a stench, not the sickly odour of decay in the 
line 36266=>meads  of  Morgul, but a foul  reek,  as if filth  unnameable were piled and 
line 36267=>hoarded in the dark within. 
line 36268=>     `Is this the only way, Smjagol? ' said Frodo. 
line 36269=>     'Yes, yes,' he answered. 'Yes, we must go this way now.' 
line 36270=>     'D'you mean to say you've been through this hole?' said Sam. `Phew! But 
line 36271=>perhaps you don't mind bad smells.' 
line 36272=>     Gollum's  eyes  glinted. `He  doesn't  know  what  we  minds,  does  he 
line 36273=>precious? No,  he  doesn't.  But Smjagol  can  bear things.  Yes.  He's been 
line 36274=>through. O yes, right through. It's the only way.' 
line 36275=>     `And what makes the smell, I  wonder,'  said Sam. `It's like  -- well, I 
line 36276=>wouldn't  like to say. Some beastly  hole of the  Orcs, I'll warrant, with a  
line 36277=>hundred years of their filth in it.' 
line 36278=>     'Well,'  said Frodo, 'Orcs or  no, if  it's the only  way, we must take 
line 36279=>it.' 
line 36280=>     Drawing a  deep breath they passed inside. In  a few steps they were in 
line 36281=>
line 36282=>####-utter and impenetrable dark. Not since the lightless passages  of  Moria had 
line 36283=>Frodo or  Sam known such darkness, and if  possible  here it was  deeper and 
line 36284=>denser. There,  there were airs moving,  and echoes,  and a sense  of space. 
line 36285=>Here the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as 
line 36286=>it were  in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itsel f that, as  it 
line 36287=>was breathed,  brought blindness not only  to the  eyes but to the mind,  so 
line 36288=>that even the memory of colours and of  forms and of any light faded out  of 
line 36289=>thought. Night always had been, and always would be, and night was all. 
line 36290=>     But for a while  they could still feel, and  indeed the senses of their 
line 36291=>feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls felt, 
line 36292=>to their surprise, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was 
line 36293=>straight and even, going ever  up  at the  same stiff slope. The  tunnel was 
line 36294=>high  and  wide,  so wide  that,  though  the hobbits  walked abreast,  only 
line 36295=>touching the side-walls with their  outstretched hands, they were separated, 
line 36296=>cut off alone in the darkness.  
line 36297=>     Gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. While 
line 36298=>they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath 
line 36299=>hissing and  gasping just in  front of them.  But  after a time their senses 
line 36300=>became duller, both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb, and they kept on, 
line 36301=>groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they 
line 36302=>had  entered, will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate 
line 36303=>beyond.  
line 36304=>     Before  they  had gone  very far, perhaps, but time and  distance  soon 
line 36305=>passed out of  his reckoning, Sam on the right, feeling  the wall, was aware 
line 36306=>that there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath 
line 36307=>of some air less heavy, and then they passed it by. 
line 36308=>     'There's more  than one passage here,'  he whispered with an effort: it 
line 36309=>seemed hard to make his breath give any  sound. `It's as orc-like a place as 
line 36310=>ever there could be! ' 
line 36311=>     After that, first he on  the right, and  then Frodo on the left, passed 
line 36312=>three or four such openings, some wider, some smaller; but  there was as yet 
line 36313=>no doubt of  the main way,  for it was straight, and did not turn, and still 
line 36314=>went steadily up. But how long was it, how much more of this would they have 
line 36315=>to  endure, or could they  endure? The breathlessness of the air was growing 
line 36316=>as they climbed; and now they seemed often  in the  blind dark to sense some 
line 36317=>resistance  thicker  than  the  foul air. As they  thrust forward they  felt 
line 36318=>things brush against their heads, or against their hands, long tentacles, or  
line 36319=>
line 36320=>####-hanging growths perhaps:  they could not tell what  they were. And still the 
line 36321=>stench grew. It grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only 
line 36322=>clear sense left t¢  them. and  that was for their torment.  One  hour,  two 
line 36323=>hours,  three  hours: how many  had  they  passed  in  this  lightless  hole?  
line 36324=>Hours-days, weeks rather. Sam left the tunnel -side and shrank towards Frodo, 
line 36325=>and their hands met and clasped. and so together they still went on. 
line 36326=>     At length Frodo, groping along the  left-hand  wall, came suddenly to a  
line 36327=>void. Almost he fell sideways  into the emptiness. Here was some  opening in 
line 36328=>the rock far  wider than any  they had yet passed; and out of it came a reek  
line 36329=>so foul, and a sense of lurking malice so intense, that Frodo reeled. And at 
line 36330=>that moment Sam too lurched and fell forwards.  
line 36331=>     Fighting off both the sickness and  the fear, Frodo gripped Sam's hand. 
line 36332=>`Up!  ' he said in  a hoarse breath without  voice. 'It all comes from here, 
line 36333=>the stench and the peril. Now for it! Quick! ' 
line 36334=>     Calling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged Sam to his 
line 36335=>feet, and  forced his own limbs to move. Sam  stumbled beside him. One step, 
line 36336=>two steps, three steps-at last six steps. Maybe they had passed the dreadful 
line 36337=>unseen opening, but  whether  that was so  or not, suddenly it was easier to 
line 36338=>move,  as if  some  hostile will  for the moment  had  released  them.  They 
line 36339=>struggled on, still hand in hand. 
line 36340=>     But almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel forked, or  
line 36341=>so it  seemed, and in the dark they could  not tell wh ich was the wider way, 
line 36342=>or  which kept nearer to the straight. Which should they take, the  left, or  
line 36343=>the  right? They knew of  nothing  to guide  them, yet a false choice  would 
line 36344=>almost certainly be fatal. 
line 36345=>     `Which way has Gollum gone? ' panted Sam. 'And why didn't he wait? ' 
line 36346=>     `Smjagol!  ' said  Frodo,  trying  to  call. 'Smjagol! '  But his voice 
line 36347=>croaked, and the  name fell dead almost as  it left his lips.  There  was no 
line 36348=>answer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air. 
line 36349=>     `He's really gone this time, I  fancy,'  muttered Sam. `I guess this is 
line 36350=>just exactly where  he meant to bring us. Gollum! If ever I lay hands on you  
line 36351=>again, you'll be sorry for it.' 
line 36352=>     Presently,  groping  and fumbling  in  the  dark, they  found  that the 
line 36353=>opening on the left wa s blocked: either it was  a blind, or else  some great 
line 36354=>stone had fallen in  the passage. 'This can't be the way,'  Frodo whispered. 
line 36355=>'Right or wrong, we must take the other.' 
line 36356=>     'And quick! ' Sam panted. 'There's something worse than Gollum about. I  
line 36357=>
line 36358=>####-can feel something looking at us.' 
line 36359=>     They had not gone  more than a  few yards  when from behind them came a  
line 36360=>sound,  startling and horrible in  the  heavy  padded  silence: a  gurgling, 
line 36361=>bubbling noise, and  a  long  venomous hiss. They wheeled round, but nothing 
line 36362=>could be seen. Still as stones they stood, staring, waiting for they did not 
line 36363=>know what. 
line 36364=>     `It's  a trap!' said Sam, and he  laid his hand upon  the  hilt  of his 
line 36365=>sword; and  as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it  
line 36366=>came. 'I   wish  old  Tom was near us  now!' he  thought.  Then  as he stood, 
line 36367=>darkness  about him and a  blackness of  despair and  anger in his heart. it 
line 36368=>seemed  to him that he saw a  light:  a light in his mind, almost unbearably 
line 36369=>bright at first, as a sun-ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless  
line 36370=>pit. Then  the light became colour: green,  gold, silver, white. Far off, as 
line 36371=>in  a  little  picture drawn  by  elven-fingers  he  saw  the Lady Galadriel 
line 36372=>standing on the  grass  in  Lurien,  and gifts  were  in her hands. And you, 
line 36373=>Ring-bearer, he  heard her say,  remote  but clear, for you  I have prepared  
line 36374=>this. 
line 36375=>     The bubbling hiss  drew nearer,  and there  was a  creaking as  of some 
line 36376=>great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark. A reek came on 
line 36377=>before it. 'Master, master!' cried Sam, and the  life and  urgency came back  
line 36378=>into his voice. 'The Lady's  gift! The star-glass! A light  to you  in  dark 
line 36379=>places, she said it was to be. The star-glass!  ' 
line 36380=>     `The star-glass?' muttered Frodo, as one answering out of sleep, hardly 
line 36381=>comprehending.  `Why  yes! Why had  I forgotten it? A  light when all  other 
line 36382=>lights go out! And now indeed light alone can help us.' 
line 36383=>     Slowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held  aloft the  Phial 
line 36384=>of Galadriel. For a moment it glimmered, faint as  a rising star  struggling 
line 36385=>in heavy earthward  mists,  and then as its power waxed,  and hope  grew  in 
line 36386=>Frodo's  mind, it  began to  burn, and kindled to a  silver flame, a  minute 
line 36387=>heart of dazzling light, as though Edrendil  had himself come down  from the 
line 36388=>high sunset paths with the last Silmaril upon his brow. The darkness receded 
line 36389=>from it until it seemed to shine in the  centre of a globe of  airy crystal, 
line 36390=>and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire. 
line 36391=>     Frodo gazed  in   wonder at this marvellous  gift  that  he  had so long 
line 36392=>carried, not guessing its full  worth and potency. Seldom had  he remembered 
line 36393=>it on the road, until they came to Morgul Vale, and never had he used it for  
line 36394=>fear of its revealing  light.  Aiya Edrendil Elenion Ancalima! he cried, and 
line 36395=>
line 36396=>####-knew  not what he had spoken; for it seemed that another voice spoke through 
line 36397=>his, clear, untroubled by the foul air of the pit. 
line 36398=>     But other  potencies  there are in  Middle-earth, powers of night,  and 
line 36399=>they are  old and strong. And She that  walked in the darkness had heard the 
line 36400=>Elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of time, and she had not heeded it, 
line 36401=>and it did  not daunt her now. Even as Frodo spoke he  felt  a great  malice 
line 36402=>bent upon him, and a deadly regard considering him. Not far down the tunnel, 
line 36403=>between them  and the  opening where  they  had reeled and stumbled, he  was 
line 36404=>aware of eyes  growing visible, two great clusters  of many-windowed eyes  -- 
line 36405=>the  coming menace was unmasked at last.  The radiance of the star -gla ss was 
line 36406=>broken and thrown back from their thousand  facets, but behind the glitter a  
line 36407=>pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame kindled in some deep 
line 36408=>pit of  evil thought. Monstrous and  abominable eyes they were, bestial  and  
line 36409=>yet filled with purpose  and with  hideous delight, gloating over their prey 
line 36410=>trapped beyond all hope of escape. 
line 36411=>     Frodo  and  Sam, horror -stricken, began slowly to back away,  their own 
line 36412=>gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so  
line 36413=>the eyes  advanced. Frodo's hand wavered, and slowly the Phial drooped. Then 
line 36414=>suddenly,  released from  the  holding spell to run  a little while  in vain 
line 36415=>panic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but 
line 36416=>even as they ran Frodo looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes 
line 36417=>came leaping up behind. The stench of death was like a cloud about him. 
line 36418=>     'Stand! stand! ' he cried desperately. `Running is no use.' 
line 36419=>     Slowly the eyes crept nearer. 
line 36420=>     `Galadriel! ' he called, and  gathering his  courage  he  lifted up the 
line 36421=>Phial once more. The eyes  halted. For a moment  their regard relaxed, as if 
line 36422=>some hint of doubt troubled them. Then Frodo's heart flamed  within him, and 
line 36423=>without thinking what he did, whether it was folly or despair or  courage, he 
line 36424=>took the Phial in  his left  hand,  and  with his right hand drew his sword. 
line 36425=>Sting flashed out, and the sharp elven-blade  sparkled in the silver  light, 
line 36426=>but at  its edges a  blue fire  flicked. Then holding the star aloft and the 
line 36427=>bright sword advanced,  Frodo,  hobbit of the Shire, walked steadily down to 
line 36428=>meet the eyes. 
line 36429=>     They wavered. Doubt  came into them as the light approached. One by one 
line 36430=>they dimmed,  and  slowly they drew back. No brightness so  deadly  had ever  
line 36431=>afflicted  them  before. From sun  and  moon and star  they  had  been  safe 
line 36432=>underground,  but now a star  had descended  into  the  very earth. Still it 
line 36433=>
line 36434=>####-approached, and the eyes began to quail. One by one they all went dark; they 
line 36435=>turned  away, and a great bulk,  beyond  the light's reach,  heaved its huge 
line 36436=>shadow in between. They were gone. 
line 36437=>     'Master, master!' cried Sam. He was close behind,  his own  sword drawn 
line 36438=>and ready. 'Stars  and glory!  But the Elves would make a song  of  that, if 
line 36439=>ever they heard of it! And may I live   to tell them and hear them sing.  But 
line 36440=>don't go  on, master. Don't go down to that den! Now's our only chance.  Now 
line 36441=>let's get out of this foul hole!' 
line 36442=>     And  so back they turned once more, first walking and then running; for  
line 36443=>as they  went the  floor  of   the tunnel rose steeply, and with every stride 
line 36444=>they climbed higher  above  the stenches  of  the  unseen lair, and strength 
line 36445=>returned  to  limb and  heart.  But still the hatred of  the  Watcher lurked 
line 36446=>behind  them, blind for a while,  perhaps,  but undefeated,  still  bent  on 
line 36447=>death. And  now there came  a  flow of air  to meet them, cold and thin. The 
line 36448=>opening, the tunnel's end, at last it was before them. Panting, yearning for  
line 36449=>a roofless place, they flung themselves forward, and  then in amazement they 
line 36450=>staggered, tumbling back. The outlet was blocked  with some barrier, but not 
line 36451=>of  stone: soft  and a  little  yielding  it  seemed,  and  yet  strong  and 
line 36452=>impervious; air filtered through, hut not a  glimmer of any light. Once more 
line 36453=>they charged and were hurled back. 
line 36454=>     Holding aloft the Phial Frodo looked and  before him he  saw a greyness 
line 36455=>which the radiance of the star-glass did not pierce  and did not illuminate, 
line 36456=>as  if it  were  a  shadow that  being cast  by  no  light,  no  light could 
line 36457=>dissipate. Across the  width and height of the  tunnel a  vast web was spun, 
line 36458=>orderly as the web of some huge spider,  but  denser -woven  and far greater,  
line 36459=>and each thread was as thick as rope. 
line 36460=>     Sam  laughed grimly.  `Cobwebs! '  he said. `Is that all?  Cobwebs! But 
line 36461=>what a spider! Have at 'em, down with 'em! ' 
line 36462=>     In a fury he  hewed at  them with his  sword,  but  the thread  that he 
line 36463=>struck did  not break.  It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked 
line 36464=>bowstring,  turning the blade and tossing up both sword and a rm. Three times 
line 36465=>Sam struck with all  his  force, and  at last  one single cord  of  all  the 
line 36466=>countless  cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through  the air.  
line 36467=>One end of it lashed Sam's hand, and he cried out in pain, starting back and 
line 36468=>drawing h is hand across his mouth. 
line 36469=>     `It will take days to clear the road like this,' he said. `What's to be 
line 36470=>done? Have those eyes come back? ' 
line 36471=>
line 36472=>####-     `No, not  to be seen,' said  Frodo.  `But  I still  feel  that they are 
line 36473=>looking at me,  or  thinking about me: making some  other plan,  perhaps. If 
line 36474=>this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.' 
line 36475=>     `Trapped in the end!  ' said Sam bitterly, his anger rising again above 
line 36476=>weariness and despair. `Gnats  in a net. May the curse of Faramir bite  that 
line 36477=>Gollum and bite him quick! ' 
line 36478=>     'That would not help us now,' said Frodo. `Come! Let us see what  Sting 
line 36479=>can  do. It is an elven-blade. There were webs of horror in the dark ravines 
line 36480=>of  Beleriand where it was forged.  But you must be the  guard and hold back 
line 36481=>the eyes. Here,  take  the  star -glass.  Do  not be afraid. Hold  it  up and 
line 36482=>watch!' 
line 36483=>     Then Frodo stepped up to the great grey  net, and hewed it  with a wide 
line 36484=>sweeping stroke,  drawing  the  bitter  edge  swiftly  across  a  ladder  of 
line 36485=>close-strung cords, and  at  once  springing  away. The  blue-gleaming blade 
line 36486=>shore through them like a scythe through grass, and they  leaped and writhed 
line 36487=>and then hung loose. A great rent was made. 
line 36488=>     Stroke  after  stroke he dealt, until at last  all the  web within  his 
line 36489=>reach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil  
line 36490=>in the incoming wind. The trap was broken. 
line 36491=>     `Come! ' cried Frodo. `On! On! ' Wild joy at their escape from the very 
line 36492=>mouth  of despair suddenly filled  all his mind. His head whirled as  with a  
line 36493=>draught of potent wine. He sprang out, shouting as he came. 
line 36494=>     It seemed light in that  dark land to his eyes  that had passed through 
line 36495=>the den of night. The great smokes had risen and grown thinner, and the last  
line 36496=>hours of a  sombre day were passing; the red glare of Mordor had died away in 
line 36497=>sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to Frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden 
line 36498=>hope. Almost he had reached  the  summit of the  wall. Only  a little higher  
line 36499=>now. The Cleft,  Cirith  Ungol, was before him, a dim  notch  in  the  black  
line 36500=>ridge, and the horns of rock darkling  in  the sky on either side.  A  short 
line 36501=>race, a sprinter's course and he would be through!  
line 36502=>     `The pass,  Sam! ' he  cried, not heeding the shrillness of  his voice, 
line 36503=>that  released  from  the choking airs of the  tunnel  rang out now high and 
line 36504=>wild. 'The  pass! Run, run, and we'll be  through-through before any one can 
line 36505=>stop us! ' 
line 36506=>     Sam came  up  behind as fast as he could  urge his legs; but glad as he 
line 36507=>was  to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on  glancing back  at 
line 36508=>the dark  arch of the tunnel, fearing to see eyes, or some  shape beyond his 
line 36509=>
line 36510=>####-imagining,  spring out in  pursuit. Too little did he or  his master know of 
line 36511=>the craft of Shelob. She had many exits from her  lair. 
line 36512=>     There agelong she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider -form, even such as 
line 36513=>once of old had lived in the Land of the Elves in the West that is now under  
line 36514=>the Sea, such as Beren fought in the Mountains of Terror  in Doriath, and so 
line 36515=>came to L®thien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight 
line 36516=>long 
line 36517=>ago. How Shelob came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out  of the 
line 36518=>Dark  Years  few tales  have come. But still she was  there, who  was  there 
line 36519=>before Sauron, and before the first  stone of Barad-dyr; and she served none 
line 36520=>but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with 
line 36521=>endless  brooding on her  feasts,  weaving  webs of shadow;  for all  living 
line 36522=>things  were  her  food,  and her  vomit  darkness.  Far and wide her lesser  
line 36523=>broods, bastards  of the miserable mates, her own offspring,  that she slew,  
line 36524=>spread from  glen to glen, from the Ephel D®ath to the eastern hills, to Dol 
line 36525=>Guldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood. But none could  rival her, Shelob the 
line 36526=>Great, last child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world. 
line 36527=>     Already,  years before, Gollum had beheld her, Smjagol  who  pried into 
line 36528=>all dark  holes, and in past days he had  bowed  and worshipped her, and the 
line 36529=>darkness of  her evil will  walked through  all  the ways of  his  weariness 
line 36530=>beside him, cutting  him off from light and from regret. And he had promised 
line 36531=>to bring  her food. But her lust was  not his lust. Little  she  knew of  or  
line 36532=>cared for towers, or  rings, or  anything devised by mind  or hand, who only  
line 36533=>desired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life. 
line 36534=>alone,  swollen  till  the  mountains  could no longer  hold her up and  the 
line 36535=>darkness could not contain her. 
line 36536=>     But that  desire  was yet far  away, and long  now had she been hungry, 
line 36537=>lurking  in  her den, while the power of  Sauron grew, and light and  living 
line 36538=>things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and  no Elf 
line 36539=>or Man came near, only the unhappy Orcs. Poor  food  and  wary. But she must  
line 36540=>eat, and however busily  they delved new winding passages from  the pass and 
line 36541=>from their tower, ever she found  some way to snare them. But she lusted for  
line 36542=>sweeter meat. And Gollum had brought it to her. 
line 36543=>     `We'll see, we'll see,'  he  said often to himself, when the evil  mood 
line 36544=>was on him, as he walked the  dangerous road from  Emyn Muil to Morgul 
line 36545=>Vale, 
line 36546=>'we'll see. It may well be, O yes, it may well be  that when She throws away 
line 36547=>
line 36548=>####-the bones  and the empty garments, we  shall find it, we  shall  get it, the 
line 36549=>Precious, a reward for poor Smjagol who brings nice food. And we'll save the 
line 36550=>Precious, as we promised. O yes.  And when we've  got  it  safe, then She'll 
line 36551=>know  it,  O  yes,  then we'll  pay  Her back,  my precious. Then  we'll pay 
line 36552=>everyone back! ' 
line 36553=>     So he thought in an inner chamber of  his cunning, which he still hoped 
line 36554=>to hide from  her,  even when he  had come  to her  again and had bowed  low 
line 36555=>before her while his companions slept. 
line 36556=>     And as for Sauron: he  knew where she lurked. It pleased  him that  she 
line 36557=>should dwell there hungry but unabated in  malice,  a more  sure  watch upon 
line 36558=>that  ancient  path into his land than any  other  that his skill could have 
line 36559=>devised. And Orcs, they were useful  slaves, but he  had them in  plenty. If 
line 36560=>now and again Shelob caught them to stay  her  appetite, she was welcome: he 
line 36561=>could spare them. And sometimes as  a man may cast a dainty to  his cat (his  
line 36562=>cat he calls her, but she owns him not) Sauron would send her prisoners that 
line 36563=>he had no better uses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and  report  
line 36564=>brought back to him of the play she made. 
line 36565=>     So  they  both lived, delighting in  their  own devices,  and feared no 
line 36566=>assault, nor wrath,  nor any end of their wickedness. Never yet had any  fly 
line 36567=>escaped from Shelob's webs, and the greater now was her rage and hunger. 
line 36568=>     But  nothing of this evil which they had stirred  up against  them  did 
line 36569=>poor Sam  know, except that a  fear  was growing on him, a menace  which  he 
line 36570=>could not see; and such a weight  did it  become that it was a burden to him 
line 36571=>to run, and his feet seemed leaden. 
line 36572=>     Dread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master 
line 36573=>was in a fey mood  running  heedlessly to meet them. Turning  his  eyes away 
line 36574=>from the shadow behind and the deep  gloom  beneath the cliff upon his left, 
line 36575=>he looked  ahead, and he saw two things  that increased his  dismay.  He saw 
line 36576=>that the sword  which  Frodo still held unsheathed was glittering  with blue 
line 36577=>flame; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark. still the  window 
line 36578=>in the tower was g lowing red. 
line 36579=>     `Orcs! '  he muttered. `We'll never rush  it  like  this.  There's Orcs 
line 36580=>about, and  worse than Orcs.' Then  returning  quickly to his  long habit of 
line 36581=>secrecy, he closed  his  hand about the precious Phial  which he still bore. 
line 36582=>Red  with his own living blood  his  hand  shone for  a moment, and then  he 
line 36583=>thrust  the revealing light deep into  a pocket near his breast and drew his 
line 36584=>elven-cloak about him.  Now he tried  to  quicken his pace.  His master  was 
line 36585=>
line 36586=>####-gaining on him; already he was some twenty strides ahead, flitting on like a  
line 36587=>shadow; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world. 
line 36588=>     Hardly had  Sam hidden the light  of  the star -glass  when she came.  A 
line 36589=>little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing  from a black hole 
line 36590=>of  shadow under the cliff, the most loathly  shape that he had ever beheld, 
line 36591=>horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but 
line 36592=>huger than  the great hunting beasts, and more terrible than they because of 
line 36593=>the evil  purpose  in her remorseless eyes.  Those  same  eyes  that  he had 
line 36594=>thought daunted and defeated, there  they were lit with a fell light  again, 
line 36595=>clustering in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short 
line 36596=>stalk -like neck was her huge swollen body,  a vast bloated bag, swaying  and 
line 36597=>sagging  between  her legs; its great  bulk was black,  blotched  with livid 
line 36598=>marks, but  the belly underneath  was pale  and  luminous  and  gave forth a  
line 36599=>stench. Her legs were bent, with great  knobbed joints high  above her back, 
line 36600=>and hairs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg's end  there was 
line 36601=>a claw. 
line 36602=>     As soon as she had  squeezed her  soft  squelching  body and its folded 
line 36603=>limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a  horrible speed, 
line 36604=>now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. She was 
line 36605=>between 
line 36606=>Sam  and his master. Either she did  not see Sam, or she avoided him for the 
line 36607=>moment as  the bearer of the  light` and fixed all her intent upon one prey, 
line 36608=>upon Frodo,  bereft of  his Phial, running heedless up the path, unaware yet 
line 36609=>of his  peril. Swiftly he ran, but Shelob was  swifter;  in a few  leaps she 
line 36610=>would have him. 
line 36611=>     Sam gasped and gathered  all his  remaining breath  to shout. 'Look out 
line 36612=>behind!  ' he yelled.  'Look  out  master!  I'm'  -- but suddenly his cry was 
line 36613=>stifled. 
line 36614=>     A long clammy hand went over his mouth and  another caught  him  by the 
line 36615=>neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg.  Taken off  his guard he 
line 36616=>toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker. 
line 36617=>     `Got him! ' hissed Gollum in his ear. `At  last, my precious, we've got 
line 36618=>him, yes, the nassty hobbit. We takes this one. She'll get the other. O yes, 
line 36619=>Shelob will get him,  not Smjagol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all. 
line 36620=>But he's got you, you nassty filthy little sneak!' He spat on Sam's neck. 
line 36621=>     Fury at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was 
line 36622=>in  deadly  peril, gave  to Sam  a sudden violence and strength that was far 
line 36623=>
line 36624=>####-beyond anything that Gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he 
line 36625=>thought him.  Not Gollum  himself  could have twisted  more quickly  or more 
line 36626=>fiercely. His hold on Sam's mouth slipped, and Sam ducked and lunged 
line 36627=>forward 
line 36628=>again, trying to tear away from the grip on his neck. His sword was still in 
line 36629=>his hand, and on his   left arm,  hanging by  its thong, was Faramir's staff.  
line 36630=>Desperately  he tried to turn and stab his enemy. But Gollum  was too quick. 
line 36631=>His long right arm shot out, and he  grabbed  Sam's wrist:  his fingers were 
line 36632=>like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till 
line 36633=>with a cry of pain Sam released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all 
line 36634=>the while Gollum's other hand was tightening on Sam's throat. 
line 36635=>     Then Sam played his last trick. With all his  strength  he  pulled away 
line 36636=>and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the 
line 36637=>ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards. 
line 36638=>     Not  expecting  even this simple trick from Sam, Gollum fell  over with 
line 36639=>Sam on top, and he received the weight of the sturdy hobbit in  his stomach.  
line 36640=>A sharp hiss came out  of him, and  for a second his hand upon  Sam's throat 
line 36641=>loosened;  but his  fingers still gripped the sword-hand. Sam  tore  himself 
line 36642=>forward  and  away,  and stood up, and then  quickly he wheeled away  to his 
line 36643=>right,  pivoted on the  wrist held by Gollum.  Laying hold of the staff with 
line 36644=>his  left hand,  Sam swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on 
line 36645=>Gollum's outstretched arm, just below the elbow.  
line 36646=>     With a squeal Gollum let go. Then  Sam  waded in; not waiting to change  
line 36647=>the staff from left to right he dealt another savage blow. Quick as  a snake 
line 36648=>Gollum slithered  aside. and the stroke aimed at his head  fell  across  his 
line 36649=>back. The staff  cracked and broke.  That was  enough for him. Grabbing from 
line 36650=>behind  was an old game of his,  and  seldom  had he failed in it.  But this 
line 36651=>time,  misled by spite,  he  had made the  mistake  of speaking and gloating 
line 36652=>before he had  both hands on his  victim's  neck. Everything  had gone wrong 
line 36653=>with  his beautiful plan,  since that horrible  light  had  so  unexpectedly 
line 36654=>appeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a furious  enemy, 
line 36655=>little less than his own size. This fight was not for him. Sam  swept up his 
line 36656=>sword from the ground and raised it. Gollum squealed , and springing aside on 
line 36657=>to all fours, he  jumped away in one big bound like a frog. Before Sam could 
line 36658=>reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel.  
line 36659=>     Sword in  hand  Sam  went  after him.  For the  moment he had forgotten  
line 36660=>everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill Gollum. 
line 36661=>
line 36662=>####-But before he could overtake him, Gollum  was gone. Then  as the  dark  hole 
line 36663=>stood before him and the stench came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder  
line 36664=>the thought of Frodo  and the monster  smote upon Sam's mind. He spun round, 
line 36665=>and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. He was 
line 36666=>too late. So far Gollum's plot had succeeded. 
line 36667=> 
line 36668=>
line 36669=>####- 
line 36670=>
line 36671=>Chapter 10. The Choices of Master Samwise 
line 36672=>
line 36673=> 
line 36674=> 
line 36675=>     Frodo was lying face upward  on the ground and the monster  was bending 
line 36676=>over  him, so intent  upon her victim  that she took  no heed of Sam and his 
line 36677=>cries, until  he was close at  hand. As he rushed up he  saw that Frodo  was 
line 36678=>already  bound  in  cords, wound about him from ankle to  shoulder,  and the  
line 36679=>monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his 
line 36680=>body away. 
line 36681=>     On  the near side of him lay, gleaming on  the ground, his elven-blade,  
line 36682=>where it had fallen useless from his grasp. Sam did not wait to  wonder wha t  
line 36683=>was to be  done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage.  He 
line 36684=>sprang  forward with a yell, and seized his master's sword in his left hand. 
line 36685=>Then he charged.  No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world 
line 36686=>of beasts; where  some  desperate  small creature  armed with  little  teeth 
line 36687=>alone,  will  spring  upon a tower of horn and  hide that  stands above  its 
line 36688=>fallen mate. 
line 36689=>     Disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned 
line 36690=>slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was 
line 36691=>aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she  had known in  countless 
line 36692=>years,  the shining sword  bit upon her  foot  and shore away  the claw. Sam 
line 36693=>sprang in, inside the arches of  her legs, and  with a quick  upthrust of his 
line 36694=>other hand stabbed at  the clustered eyes upon her lowered  head. One  great 
line 36695=>eye went dark. 
line 36696=>     Now  the miserable creature was right under her, for the  moment out of 
line 36697=>the reach of her  sting and of her claws.  Her vast belly was above him with 
line 36698=>its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury 
line 36699=>held for  one more blow, and  before she could sink upon him, smothering him 
line 36700=>and all his little impudence of courage, he  slashed  the bright elven-blade 
line 36701=>across her with desperate strength. 
line 36702=>     But Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her 
line 36703=>eyes.  Knobbed  and pitted  with corruption  was her  age-old hide, but ever  
line 36704=>thickened from within with  layer on layer of evil  growth. The blade scored 
line 36705=>it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any 
line 36706=>strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should  forge the steel or the hand  
line 36707=>of Beren or of T®rin wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up 
line 36708=>
line 36709=>####-the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head. Poison frothed and bubbled 
line 36710=>from  the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge  bulk down  on 
line 36711=>him 
line 36712=>again.  Too  soon.  For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping  his own 
line 36713=>sword, with both hands he  held the  elven-blade  point upwards, fending off  
line 36714=>that ghastly roof; and  so  Shelob, with  the driving force of her own cruel 
line 36715=>will, with  strength greater than  any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a  
line 36716=>bitter  spike.  Deep,  deep it pricked, as Sam was  crushed  slowly  to  the 
line 36717=>ground. 
line 36718=>     No such anguish  had  Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in  all 
line 36719=>her long  world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old Gondor, nor  
line 36720=>the most savage Orc  entrapped, had ever thus  endured  her, or set blade to 
line 36721=>her beloved flesh. A shudder  went through her.  Heaving up again, wrenching 
line 36722=>away  from the  pain,  she  bent her writhing limbs  beneath  her and sprang 
line 36723=>backwards in a convulsive leap. 
line 36724=>     Sam had fallen to his knees by Frodo's head, his senses  reeling in the 
line 36725=>foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. Through the 
line 36726=>mist before his eyes he was  aware  dimly of Frodo's face  and stubbornly he 
line 36727=>fought to  master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon 
line 36728=>him.  Slowly  he raised his head and saw her, only  a few paces away, eyeing 
line 36729=>him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom,  and a green ooze trickling from 
line 36730=>below her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed 
line 36731=>upon 
line 36732=>the ground,  the great bows of her legs quivering, as she  gather ed  herself 
line 36733=>for another spring-this time to crush  and sting to death: no little bite of 
line 36734=>poison to  still the struggling of  her meat; this time  to slay and then to 
line 36735=>rend. 
line 36736=>     Even  as Sam himself crouched, looking at her, seeing  his death in her  
line 36737=>eyes,  a  thought came  to him, as  if some remote voice had  spoken. and he 
line 36738=>fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and 
line 36739=>hard  and  solid  it seemed to  his touch  in a phantom world of horror, the 
line 36740=>Phial of Galadriel. 
line 36741=>     'Galadr iel!  ' he said  faintly, and  then he heard voices far off  but 
line 36742=>clear: the crying of the Elves as they walked under the stars in the beloved 
line 36743=>shadows of the  Shire, and  the music  of the Elves as  it came  through his 
line 36744=>sleep in the Hall of Fire in the house of Elrond. 
line 36745=>     Gilthoniel A Elbereth! 
line 36746=>
line 36747=>####-     And then his tongue was loosed and  his voice cried in a language which  
line 36748=>he did not know:  
line 36749=>     A Elbereth Gilthoniel 
line 36750=>     o menel palan-diriel, 
line 36751=>     le nallon sn di'nguruthos! 
line 36752=>     A tiro nin, Fanuilos! 
line 36753=>     And  with  that  he staggered  to  his feet and was Samwise the hobbit, 
line 36754=>Hamfast's son, again. 
line 36755=>     `Now come, you filth!' he cried. `You've hurt my master, you brute, and 
line 36756=>you'll pay for it. We're going on; but we'll settle with you first. Come on, 
line 36757=>and taste it again!' 
line 36758=>     As  if his indomitable spirit had set  its potency in motion, the glass 
line 36759=>blazed  suddenly like a white torch in his  hand. It flamed like a star that 
line 36760=>leaping from the firmament sears  the  dark  air with  intolerable light. No 
line 36761=>such terror out of heaven had ever burned in Shelob's face before. The beams 
line 36762=>of it entered into her wounded head  and scored it with unbearable pain, and 
line 36763=>the  dreadful  infection of light  spread  from  eye to  eye. She  fell back  
line 36764=>beating  the air with her  forelegs, her   sight blasted by inner lightnings,  
line 36765=>her  mind  in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and 
line 36766=>began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind. 
line 36767=>     Sam came  on. He was reeling like a drunken man,  but he came  on.  And 
line 36768=>Shelob cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered  as she  tried 
line 36769=>to  hasten from him. She  reached  the hole,  and  squeezing down, leaving a  
line 36770=>trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as Sam hewed a last stroke 
line 36771=>at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground. 
line 36772=>     Shelob was  gone; and  whether she lay  long in her  lair, nursing  her  
line 36773=>malice  and her misery, and  in slow years of darkness  healed  herself from 
line 36774=>within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun 
line 36775=>once more her dreadful snares in the glens of the Mountains of  Shadow, this 
line 36776=>tale does not tell. 
line 36777=>     Sam was left alone. Wearily, as the evening  of the Nameless Land  fell 
line 36778=>upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master. 
line 36779=>     'Master, dear master,' he said, but Frodo did not  speak. As he had run 
line 36780=>forward, eager, rejoicing  to be  free,  Shelob  with hideous speed had come 
line 36781=>behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale, 
line 36782=>and heard no voice. and did not move. 
line 36783=>     `Master, dear  master! ' said Sam, and through  a long  silence waited. 
line 36784=>
line 36785=>####-listening in vain. 
line 36786=>     Then as quickly as he could he  cut away the binding cords and laid his 
line 36787=>head upon  Frodo's  breast and to his mouth, but  no stir of life  could  he 
line 36788=>find, nor  feel  the  faintest flutter of  the  heart. Often  he chafed  his 
line 36789=>master's hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold. 
line 36790=>     `Frodo, Mr. Frodo! ' he called. 'Don't leave me here alone!  It's  your 
line 36791=>Sam calling. Don't go  where I can't follow! Wake up, Mr. Frodo!  O wake up, 
line 36792=>Frodo, me dear, me dear. Wake up!' 
line 36793=>     Then anger surged over hint,  and he ran  about his master's body in  a  
line 36794=>rage,  stabbing the air,  and smiting the  stones, and shouting  challenges.  
line 36795=>Presently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo's face, pale beneath him 
line 36796=>in the  dusk.  And  suddenly  he  saw that he was  in the  picture  that was 
line 36797=>revealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in Lurien: Frodo with a pale face 
line 36798=>lying fast asleep under  a great  dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had  thought 
line 36799=>then. `He's dead! ' he said. 'Not asleep, dead! ' And  as he  said it, as if 
line 36800=>the words had set the venom to its work again. it seemed to him that the hue 
line 36801=>of the face grew livid green. 
line 36802=>     And  then black despair came down  on him, and Sam bowed to the ground, 
line 36803=>and drew his grey hood over his head, and night came into  his heart, and he 
line 36804=>knew no more. 
line 36805=>     When at last the blackness passed, Sam looked up and shadows were about 
line 36806=>him; but for how many  minutes or  hours the world had  gone dragging on  he 
line 36807=>could not  tell. He was still in  the  same place,  and still his master lay 
line 36808=>beside him dead. The mountains had not crumbled  nor  the earth fallen  into 
line 36809=>ruin. 
line 36810=>     'What shall I do, what shall I do? ' he said.  `Did I come all this way 
line 36811=>with h im for  nothing? ' And then he remembered his own voice speaking 
line 36812=>words 
line 36813=>that at the time he  did not  understand  himself, at the beginning of their 
line 36814=>journey: I have something to do before the end. I must see  it through, sir, 
line 36815=>if you understand . 
line 36816=>     `But what can I do? Not leave  Mr. Frodo dead, unburied on  the  top of 
line 36817=>the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?' he repeated, and for  a 
line 36818=>moment 
line 36819=>doubt and fear  shook him. `Go on?  Is  that what I've  got to do? And leave 
line 36820=>him?' 
line 36821=>     Then at last he began to weep; and going to Frodo he composed his body, 
line 36822=>
line 36823=>####-and folded his cold hands upon his breast,  and wrapped his cloak about him; 
line 36824=>and he laid  his own sword at one side, and the staff that Faramir had given 
line 36825=>at the other. 
line 36826=>     'If I'm  to  go on,' he  said,  `then  I must take your sword,  by your 
line 36827=>leave, Mr. Frodo, but I'll put this one to lie by you, as it lay by the  old 
line 36828=>king in the barrow; and you've got your beautiful mithril coat from  old Mr. 
line 36829=>Bilbo. And  your star-glass, Mr. Frodo, you did lend it to me and I'll  need 
line 36830=>it, for I'll be  always in the dark now. It's too good  for me, and the Lady 
line 36831=>gave it  to you, but maybe she'd understand. Do  you  understand, Mr. Frodo? 
line 36832=>I've got to go on.' 
line 36833=>     But he could not  go, not yet. He knelt and held Frodo's hand and could 
line 36834=>not release it. And time went  by and  still he knelt, holding  his master's 
line 36835=>hand, and in his heart keeping a debate. 
line 36836=>     Now he tried to find strength to tear himself  away and go  on a lonely 
line 36837=>journey -- for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger  would bear him down 
line 36838=>all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: Gollum. Then 
line 36839=>Gollum would die in a corner. But that was not what he had set out to do. It 
line 36840=>would  not be  worth while to leave his master for  that. It would not bring 
line 36841=>him back. Nothing would. They had better both be dead together. And that too 
line 36842=>would be a lonely journey. 
line 36843=>     He  looked on  the bright point of the sword. He thought  of the places 
line 36844=>behind where there  was a black brink  and an  empty  fall into nothingness.  
line 36845=>There  was no  escape  that way. That was to do nothing, not even to grieve.  
line 36846=>That was not what he had set  out to do. 'What am  I to  do then? ' he cried 
line 36847=>again,  and now he seemed  plainly to know the hard  answer: see it through. 
line 36848=>Another lonely journey, and the worst. 
line 36849=>     `What? Me, alone, go  to the Crack of Doom and all? ' He quailed still, 
line 36850=>but the resolve grew. `What? Me take  the Ring from him? The Council gave it 
line 36851=>to him.' 
line 36852=>     But the answer came at  once: `And the  Council gave him companions, so 
line 36853=>that  the errand  should not fail.  And you are the last of all the Company. 
line 36854=>The errand must not fail.' 
line 36855=>     `I wish I wasn't the last,' he groaned. `I wish old Gandalf was hare or  
line 36856=>somebody. Why am I left all alone to make up my mind?  I'm sure to go wrong. 
line 36857=>And it's not for me to go taking the Ring, putting myself forward.' 
line 36858=>     'But you haven't put yourself forward; you've been  put forward. And as 
line 36859=>for  not  being the right and proper person,  why,  Mr. Frodo wasn't as  you  
line 36860=>
line 36861=>####-might say, nor Mr. Bilbo. They didn't choose themselves.' 
line 36862=>     `Ah well, I must make up my  own mind. I  will  make it up. But I'll be 
line 36863=>sure to go wrong: that'd be Sam Gamgee all over. 
line 36864=>     'Let  me see  now:  if we're found here, or Mr. Frodo's found, and that 
line 36865=>Thing's on him,  well, the Enemy  will  get it. And that's the end of all of 
line 36866=>us, of Lorien, and  Rivendell, and the Shire and all. And there s no time to 
line 36867=>lose,  or it'll  be the end anyway.  The war's begun, and  more than  likely 
line 36868=>things are all going the Enemy's way  already. No  chance to go back with It  
line 36869=>and  get advice or permission.  No, it's sit here till they come and kill me 
line 36870=>over master's body, and gets It: or take It and go.'  He drew a deep breath. 
line 36871=>'Then take It, it is! ' 
line 36872=>     He stooped. Very gently he undid  the clasp at the neck and slipped his 
line 36873=>hand inside Frodo's tunic;  then with his other  hand raising the  head,  he 
line 36874=>kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the chain over  it.  And  then the 
line 36875=>head lay quietly back again in rest. No change came over the still face, and 
line 36876=>by that  more than by all  other tokens Sam was convinced at last that Frodo  
line 36877=>had died and laid aside the Quest. 
line 36878=>     `Good-bye, master,  my dear! ' he  murmured. 'Forgive  your Sam.  He'll 
line 36879=>come back to  this spot when  the job's done  -- if  he manages it. And then 
line 36880=>he'll  not leave  you again. Rest  you quiet  till  I  come; and may no foul 
line 36881=>creature come anigh you! And if the Lady could hear me and give me one wish, 
line 36882=>I would wish to come back and find you again. Good-bye!  ' 
line 36883=>     And then he bent his own  neck and put the chain upon  it, and  at once 
line 36884=>his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of  the Ring, as if a great 
line 36885=>stone  had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the weight became  less, or  
line 36886=>new strength grew in him, he raised his  head, and then with a  great effort 
line 36887=>got to his feet and found that  he could walk and bear his burden. And for a  
line 36888=>moment he lifted up the Phial  and looked down at his master,  and the light  
line 36889=>burned gently  now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and 
line 36890=>in that light Frodo's face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an 
line 36891=>elvish beauty,  as of one who has  long  passed the  shadows. And  with  the  
line 36892=>bitter comfort of that last sight Sam  turned and hid the light and stumbled 
line 36893=>on into the growing dark. 
line 36894=>     He  had not far to go.  The  tunnel was some way  behind;  the  Cleft a  
line 36895=>couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in  the dusk` a  
line 36896=>deep rut worn in  ages of  passage,  running  now gently up in a long trough 
line 36897=>with cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came  to a  
line 36898=>
line 36899=>####-long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the orc-tower  was right  above him, 
line 36900=>frowning black, and in it the red eye  glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark 
line 36901=>shadow under it. He was coming to the top of  the steps and was in the Cleft  
line 36902=>at last. 
line 36903=>     'I've made up  my  mind,' he kept saying to himself.  But  he  had not. 
line 36904=>Though  he  had done his best  to  think it  out,  what  he  was  doing  was 
line 36905=>altogether against the grain  of his nature.  `Have  I  got it  wrong? '  he 
line 36906=>muttered. `What ought I to have done? ' 
line 36907=>     As the sheer sides of the Cleft closed about him, before he reached the 
line 36908=>actual summit,  before  he looked  at last on the  path descending into  the 
line 36909=>Nameless Land. he turned. For a moment, motionless  in intolerable doubt, he 
line 36910=>looked back. He could still see, like a small blot in  the gathering  gloom, 
line 36911=>the mouth  of the tunnel; and he thought he could see or  guess where  Frodo  
line 36912=>lay. He fancied there was a glimmer on the ground  down there, or perhaps it 
line 36913=>was some trick of his tears, as he peered out at that high stony place where 
line 36914=>all his life had fallen in ruin. 
line 36915=>     'If only I could have my wish, my one wish,' he sighed, `to go back and 
line 36916=>find him! '  Then  at last he turned to  the  road in front and took  a  few 
line 36917=>steps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken. 
line 36918=>     Only a few steps; and now only a  few more and  he would be going  down 
line 36919=>and would never see that high place again. And then suddenly  he heard cries 
line 36920=>and voices. He stood still as  stone.  Orc-voices. They were behind him  and 
line 36921=>before him.  A noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts:  Orcs were coming up 
line 36922=>to  the  Cleft from the  far side, from  some entry to  the tower,  perhaps.  
line 36923=>Tramping feet and shouts behind. He  wheeled round. He saw small red lights, 
line 36924=>torches, winking away below there as they  issued  from the tunnel. At  last  
line 36925=>the hunt was up. The red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught. 
line 36926=>     Now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was 
line 36927=>very near. In a  minute they would reach the top and be on  him. He had taken 
line 36928=>too long in making up his mind, and now it was no good. How could he escape, 
line 36929=>or save himself, or save the Ring? The Ring. He was not aware of any thought 
line 36930=>or  decision. He simply found himself drawing  out the  chain and taking the 
line 36931=>Ring in his hand.  The head of  the  orc-company appeared in the Cleft right  
line 36932=>before him. Then he put it on. 
line 36933=>     The world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with an  hour  
line 36934=>of thought. At once he was aware that  hearing was sharpened while sight was 
line 36935=>dimmed, but otherwise than in  Shelob's  lair. All things about him now were 
line 36936=>
line 36937=>####-not dark but vague; while he himself was there in  a grey hazy world, alone,  
line 36938=>like a small black solid rock and the Ring, weighing down his left hand, was 
line 36939=>like an orb of hot gold. He did not feel invisible at  all, but horribly and 
line 36940=>uniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an Eye was searching for him. 
line 36941=>     He heard the  crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in Morgul 
line 36942=>Vale;  and down away under the rock the bubbling misery  of Shelob, groping, 
line 36943=>lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the 
line 36944=>cries of the Orcs  as they came out of the tunnel; and deafening, roaring in 
line 36945=>his ears, the crash of the feet  a nd the  rending clamour of the Orcs before 
line 36946=>him.  He  shrank  against the cliff. But  they marched  up  like  a  phantom 
line 36947=>company,  grey distorted  figures in a mist, only  dreams of  fear with pale 
line 36948=>flames in their hands. And they passed him  by. He  cowered , trying to creep  
line 36949=>away into some cranny and to hide. 
line 36950=>     He listened.  The Orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had 
line 36951=>sighted one another,  and  both parties were now hurrying  and  shouting. He 
line 36952=>heard them both clearly, and he understood what they  said. Perhaps the Ring 
line 36953=>gave understanding of tongues,  or simply  understanding, especially  of the  
line 36954=>servants  of  Sauron  its maker, so that if he gave heed,  he understood and 
line 36955=>translated  the thought  to himself. Certainly the Ring had grown greatly in 
line 36956=>power  as it approached the places of its forging; but one  thing it did not 
line 36957=>confer, and that  was courage. At present Sam  still thought only of hiding, 
line 36958=>of lying low till all  was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. He  could 
line 36959=>not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears.  
line 36960=>     'Hola! Gorbag! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already? ' 
line 36961=>     'Orders, you lubber. And what are  you doing, Shagrat? Tired of lurking 
line 36962=>up there? Thinking of coming down to fight? ' 
line 36963=>     'Orders to  you.  I'm in command  of this pass.  So speak civil. What's 
line 36964=>your report?  ' 
line 36965=>     'Nothing.' 
line 36966=>     `Hai!  hai! yoi!'  A yell  broke into the exchanges of the leaders. The 
line 36967=>Orcs lower down  had  suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the 
line 36968=>others. 
line 36969=>     `Hai! Hola! Here's something! Lying right in  the road. A spy, a spy! ' 
line 36970=>There was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices.  
line 36971=>     With a dreadful stroke Sam was wakened from his cowering mood. They 
line 36972=>had 
line 36973=>seen  his master. What would they do? He had heard tales of the Orcs to make 
line 36974=>
line 36975=>####-the blood run cold. It could not be borne. He  sprang up. He flung the Quest  
line 36976=>and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them.  He knew now where 
line 36977=>his place was  and had been: at  his master's side, though what he  could do 
line 36978=>there  was not clear. Back  he  ran down the  steps, down the  path  towards 
line 36979=>Frodo. 
line 36980=>     `How many are there?'  he  thought. `Thirty or forty  from the tower at 
line 36981=>least, and  a  lot more than  that  from down below, I guess. How many can I 
line 36982=>kill before they get  me? They'll see the flame of  the  sword, as soon as I 
line 36983=>draw it, and they'll get me  sooner or later. I wonder if any song will ever  
line 36984=>mention it: How Samwise  fell  in  the High Pass and made  a wall of  bodies 
line 36985=>round his master. No,  no song. Of course not, for the Ring'll be found, and 
line 36986=>there'll be  no more songs. I can't help it. My place is  by Mr. Frodo. They 
line 36987=>must understand that  --  Elrond  and the Council, and  the  great Lords and 
line 36988=>Ladies with all their wisdom. Their plans  have gone wrong. I can't be their 
line 36989=>Ring-bearer. Not without Mr. Frodo.' 
line 36990=>     But the  Orcs were  out  of his dim sight now. He  had  had no  time to 
line 36991=>consider himself, but now he  realized  that he was  weary, weary almost  to  
line 36992=>exhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. He was  too slow. The 
line 36993=>path seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist?  
line 36994=>     There they were  again!  A good way  ahead still. A cluster of  figures 
line 36995=>round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and 
line 36996=>that, bent like dogs on a trail. He tried to make a spurt. 
line 36997=>     'Come on, Sam!  ' he said, `or you'll be too late  again.' He  loosened 
line 36998=>the sword in its sheath. In a minute he would draw it, and then-- 
line 36999=>     There was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted 
line 37000=>from the ground. 'Ya hoi! Ya harri hoi! Up! Up! ' 
line 37001=>     Then a  voice shouted: `Now off! The quick way. Back to  the Undergate! 
line 37002=>She'll  not  trouble us  tonight  by  all  the signs.'  The  whole  band  of 
line 37003=>orc-figures  began  to move. Four in the middle were carrying a body high on 
line 37004=>their shoulders. `Ya hoi!  ' 
line 37005=>     They had taken Frodo's body. They were off. He could not catch them up. 
line 37006=>Still he laboured on. The Orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those 
line 37007=>with the  burden  went  first, and  behind them  there  was a  good  deal of 
line 37008=>struggling  and  jostling. Sam came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue 
line 37009=>in his  wavering hand, but they did not see it. Even as  he came panting up, 
line 37010=>the last of them vanished into the black hole. 
line 37011=>     For a moment he stood, gasping,  clutching his breast. Then he drew his 
line 37012=>
line 37013=>####-sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears.  'Curse 
line 37014=>the filth! ' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness.  
line 37015=>     It no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if 
line 37016=>he  had  stepped out of  a thin mist into  a heavier fog. His  weariness was 
line 37017=>growing but his will  hardened  all the more. He thought  he  could  see the 
line 37018=>light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch 
line 37019=>them up. Orcs go fast in tunnels, and this  tunnel  they  knew well.; for in 
line 37020=>spite of Shelob they were forced  to use it  often as the swiftest  way from 
line 37021=>the Dead City over the mountains. In  what far -off time  the main tunnel and 
line 37022=>the great round  pit had been  made, where Shelob had  taken up her abode in 
line 37023=>ages past. they did not  know: but many byways they  had  themselves  delved 
line 37024=>about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro 
line 37025=>on  the business of their masters.  Tonight they  did not intend to  go  far 
line 37026=>down. but  were  hastening to find  a side-passage  that  led back  to their 
line 37027=>watch-tower on  the cliff. Must of  them were gleeful,  delighted with  what 
line 37028=>they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the 
line 37029=>fashion of their kind. Sam heard the  noise  of their harsh voices, flat and 
line 37030=>hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the 
line 37031=>rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The  captains of the  two parties 
line 37032=>seemed to  be bringing up the rear, debating as they went. 
line 37033=>     'Can't you  stop your rabble  making such a racket, Shagrat? '  grunted 
line 37034=>the one. `We don't want Shelob on us.' 
line 37035=>     `Go on, Gorbag! Yours are  making  more than half the noise,'  said the 
line 37036=>other.  `But let the  lads play! No need to worry about  Shelob for a bit, I 
line 37037=>reckon. She's sat on a nail, it  seems, and we shan't cry about that. Didn't  
line 37038=>you see: a nasty  mess all the way  back to  that cursed crack  of  hers? If 
line 37039=>we've stopped it once, we've stopped it  a  hundred times. So let 'em laugh. 
line 37040=>And we've struck a bit of luck at last: got something that Lugb®rz wants.' 
line 37041=>     'Lugb®rz wants it, eh? What is it, d'you think? Elvish it looked to me, 
line 37042=>but undersized. What's the danger in a thing like that? ' 
line 37043=>     'Don't know till we've had a look.' 
line 37044=>     'Oho! So they  haven't  told you what to expect? They don't tell us all 
line 37045=>they  know, do  they? Not by  half. But they can make mistakes, even the Top 
line 37046=>Ones can.' 
line 37047=>     `Sh, Gorbag!'  Shagrat's voice  was  lowered, so  tha t  even  with  his 
line 37048=>strangely sharpened hearing Sam could only just  catch  what was said. 'They 
line 37049=>may, but they've got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as 
line 37050=>
line 37051=>####-not.  But there's no  doubt about it, they're troubled about something.  The 
line 37052=>Nazgyl  down below are, by your account; and Lugb®rz is too. Something 
line 37053=>nearly 
line 37054=>slipped.' 
line 37055=>     `Nearly, you say! ' said Gorbag. 
line 37056=>     `All right,' said Shagrat, `but we'll  talk of that later: Wait till we 
line 37057=>get to the Under -way.  There's a place there where  we can talk a bit, while 
line 37058=>the lads go on.' 
line 37059=>     Shortly  afterwards  Sam saw the  torches  disappear. Then there  was a  
line 37060=>rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. As far as  he could guess 
line 37061=>the Orcs  had turned and gone into the very opening which Frodo  and  he  had 
line 37062=>tried and found blocked. It was still blocked. 
line 37063=>     There  seemed to be a  great stone  in  the  way,  but the Orcs had got 
line 37064=>through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were 
line 37065=>still running  along, deeper and deeper into the mountain,  back towards the 
line 37066=>tower. Sam felt desperate. They were carrying off his master's body for some 
line 37067=>foul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and 
line 37068=>he  threw himself against it, but it did not  yield. Then not far inside, or 
line 37069=>so he thought,  he  heard the two captains' voices talking  again.  He stood 
line 37070=>still  listening  for a little  hoping  perhaps  to learn something  useful. 
line 37071=>Perhaps Gorbag, who seemed to belong to Minas Morgul, would come out, and 
line 37072=>he 
line 37073=>could then slip in. 
line 37074=>     `No,  I  don't  know,' said  Gorbag's voice. `The messages  go  through 
line 37075=>quicker  than anything could fly, as a rule. But I  don't  enquire how  it's 
line 37076=>done. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazgyl give me the creeps. And they skin the 
line 37077=>body off you as soon as  look at you, and leave  you all cold in the  dark on 
line 37078=>the  other side. But He likes 'em;  they're His favourites nowadays, so it's 
line 37079=>no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving down in the city.' 
line 37080=>     `You should try being up here with Shelob for company,' said Shagrat. 
line 37081=>     'I'd like to try somewhere where there's  none of 'em. But the war's on 
line 37082=>now, and when that's over things may be easier.' 
line 37083=>     `It's going well, they say.' 
line 37084=>     'They would.' grunted  Gorbag. `We'll  see. But anyway, if  it does  go 
line 37085=>well,  there should  be  a lot more  room. What d'you  say?   -- if we get  a 
line 37086=>chance, you and me'll slip  off  and set up somewhere on our  own with a few 
line 37087=>trusty lads, somewhere  where there's good  loot nice and handy, and no  big  
line 37088=>
line 37089=>####-bosses.' 
line 37090=>     'Ah! ' said Shagrat. `Like old times.' 
line 37091=>     `Yes,' said Gorbag. 'But don't count on it. I'm not easy in my mind. As 
line 37092=>I  said, the Big Bosses, ay,' his voice  sank almost to a whisper, `ay, even 
line 37093=>the  Biggest,  can  make mistakes. Something  nearly slipped you say. I say, 
line 37094=>something has slipped. And we've got to  look out. Always the poor  Uruks to 
line 37095=>put slips right, and small thanks. But don't forget: the enemies don't  love 
line 37096=>us  any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we're done 
line 37097=>too. But see here: when were you ordered out? ' 
line 37098=>     `About an hour ago,  just  before you  saw us.  A message  came: Nazgyl 
line 37099=>uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to  head of Stairs. 
line 37100=>I came at once.' 
line 37101=>     'Bad business,'  said Gorbag.  `See  here  -- our Silent  Watchers were 
line 37102=>uneasy more than two days ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out 
line 37103=>for another  day, nor any message sent to Lugb®rz either: owing to the Great 
line 37104=>Signal going up, and the High Nazgyl going off to the war, and all that. And 
line 37105=>then they couldn't get Lugb®rz to pay attention for a good while, I'm told.' 
line 37106=>     `The Eye  was busy elsewhere,  I  suppose,'  said Shagrat.  `Big things 
line 37107=>going on away west, they say.' 
line 37108=>     'I daresay,' growled Gorbag.  `But in the meantime enemies  have got up 
line 37109=>the Stairs. And what were you up to? You're  supposed to  keep watch, aren't 
line 37110=>you, special orders or no? What are you for?' 
line 37111=>     `That's enough! Don't try and teach me my job. We were awake all right.  
line 37112=>We knew there were funny things going on.' 
line 37113=>     `Very funny!  ' 
line 37114=>     `Yes, very funny: lights  and  shouting and all. But Shelob was on  the 
line 37115=>go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.' 
line 37116=>     `Her Sneak? What's that? ' 
line 37117=>     `You  must  have  seen  him:  little thin  black  fellow; like a spider  
line 37118=>himself, or perhaps more lik e a starved frog. He's  been  here  before. Came 
line 37119=>out of Lugb®rz the first time, years  ago,  and  we had word from High Up to 
line 37120=>let  him pass.  He's been up the Stairs once  or twice since then, but we've 
line 37121=>left him  alone: seems  to  have some  understanding with  Her  Ladyship.  I  
line 37122=>suppose he's no good to eat:  she wouldn't  worry about words from High  Up. 
line 37123=>But a  fine guard you keep in the valley:  he  was up here a day  before all 
line 37124=>this racket. Early last  night we  saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her  
line 37125=>Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good  enough for me, until the 
line 37126=>
line 37127=>####-message came.  I thought  her  Sneak had  brought her a toy. or  that  you'd 
line 37128=>perhaps  sent  her a present,  a  prisoner  of  war  or  something. I  don't 
line 37129=>interfere  when  she's pla ying.  Nothing gets by  Shelob  when  she's on the 
line 37130=>hunt.' 
line 37131=>     'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I tell you  I'm 
line 37132=>not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, did  get by. It cut her web  
line 37133=>and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about! ' 
line 37134=>     `Ah well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? ' 
line 37135=>     `Got him? Got who? This little fellow? But if  he was the only one then 
line 37136=>she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now. And 
line 37137=>if Lugb®rz wanted him, you'd  have to go and get him. Nice for you. But there 
line 37138=>was more than one.' 
line 37139=>     At this point Sam began to listen  more attentively and pressed his ear 
line 37140=>against the stone. 
line 37141=>     'Who cut the cords she'd  put round  him, Shagrat? Same one  as cut the 
line 37142=>web. Didn't you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her Ladyship? Same one, I 
line 37143=>reckon. And where is he? Where is he, Shagrat? ' 
line 37144=>     Shagrat made no reply. 
line 37145=>     `You may  well put  your  thinking cap on,  if you've  got one. It's no 
line 37146=>laughing matter. No  one, no one  has ever stuck a  pin in Shelob before, as 
line 37147=>you  should  know well enough.  There's no  grief in that; but think -there's 
line 37148=>someone  loose hereabouts  as is more dangerous than any other  damned rebel 
line 37149=>that ever  walked since the bad old times, since the  Great Siege. Something  
line 37150=>has slipped.' 
line 37151=>     `And what is it then? ' growled Shagrat. 
line 37152=>     `By all the  signs, Captain  Shagrat, I'd say there's  a  large warrior  
line 37153=>loose,  Elf most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: 
line 37154=>and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. Very funny 
line 37155=>indeed! ' Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself.  
line 37156=>     'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy  view.'  said  Shagrat. 'You can 
line 37157=>read the signs how you like, but there  may be  other   ways to explain them. 
line 37158=>Anyhow. I've  got watchers  at every point, and  I'm  going to deal with one 
line 37159=>thing at a  time. When  I've had  a look at the fellow we have caught,  then 
line 37160=>I'll begin to worry  
line 37161=> 
line 37162=>1cb2 
line 37163=> 
line 37164=>
line 37165=>####-about something else.' 
line 37166=>     `It's my guess you won't find much in that little fellow,' said Gorbag. 
line 37167=>'He may have had nothing to  do  with the real mischief. The big fellow with 
line 37168=>the sharp sword doesn't seem to have thought him  worth much  anyhow  -- just  
line 37169=>left him lying: regular elvish trick.' 
line 37170=>     `We'll see. Come on now! We've talked enough. Let's go  and have a look 
line 37171=>at the prisoner! 
line 37172=>     `What  are  you going to do with him? Don't forget I spotted him first. 
line 37173=>If there's any game, me and my lads must be in it.' 
line 37174=>     'Now, now,' growled  Shagrat. 'I  have my  orders. And it's more than my 
line 37175=>belly's worth, or yours, to break 'em. Any trespasser found by the  guard is 
line 37176=>to  be held at the  tower. Prisoner is  to be stripped. Full description  of 
line 37177=>every  article, garment, weapon,  letter,  ring. or trinket is to be sent to 
line 37178=>Lugb®rz at once, and to  Lugb®rz only . And  the prisoner is to be  kept safe  
line 37179=>and intact,  under pain  of death for every member  of  the guard, until  He 
line 37180=>sends or comes Himself. That's plain enough,  and that's what I'm  going  to 
line 37181=>do.' 
line 37182=>     'Stripped, eh? ' said Gorbag. 'What, teeth, nails, hair, and all? ' 
line 37183=>     `No,  none of that. He's for Lugb®rz,  I tell you. He's wanted safe and 
line 37184=>whole.' 
line 37185=>     'You'll find that difficult,' laughed Gorbag. 'He's nothing but carrion 
line 37186=>now. What Lugb®rz will do with such  stuff I can't guess. He might as well go 
line 37187=>in the pot.' 
line 37188=>     'You  fool,'  snarled Shagrat.  'You've been talking very  clever,  but 
line 37189=>there's a lot you don't  know, though most other folk do. You'll be  for the 
line 37190=>pot or for Shelob, if you don't take  care. Carrion! Is that all you know of 
line 37191=>Her Ladyship? When she binds with cords,  she's after meat. She  doesn't eat 
line 37192=>dead meat, nor suck cold blood. This fellow isn't dead! ' 
line 37193=>     Sam reeled, clutching at the stone. He felt as if  the whole dark world 
line 37194=>was turning upside  down. So great was the shock that he almost swooned, but 
line 37195=>even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep inside him he was aware 
line 37196=>of the  comment: 'You  fool, he  isn't dead, and your heart  knew  it. Don't  
line 37197=>trust your head, Samwise, it is not the best part  of you. The  trouble with 
line 37198=>you is that you never really had any hope. Now what is to be done? ' Fur the  
line 37199=>moment nothing, but to prop himself against the  unmoving  stone and listen, 
line 37200=>listen to the vile orc-voices. 
line 37201=>     `Garn!'  said  Shagrat. 'She's got more than  one  poison.  When  she's 
line 37202=>
line 37203=>####-hunting, she just gives 'em a dab in the neck and  they go as limp as  boned 
line 37204=>fish, and then she has her way with them. D'you remember old Ufthak? We lost  
line 37205=>him for days.  Then we found him in a corner;  hanging up he was, but he was 
line 37206=>wide awake  and glaring. How we laughed! She'd  forgotten him, maybe, but 
line 37207=>we 
line 37208=>didn't  touch him-no  good interfering with Her. Nar  -- this  little filth, 
line 37209=>he'll wake up, in  a few hours; and  beyond feeling a  bit sick for  a  hit, 
line 37210=>he'll be  all right. Or would  be,  if Lugb®rz  would let him alone. And  of 
line 37211=>course, beyond wondering where he is and what's happened to him.' 
line 37212=>     'And what's going to happen to him,' laughed Gorbag. 'We can tell him a  
line 37213=>few stories at  any rate, if we can't do a nything else. I don't suppose he's 
line 37214=>ever been in lovely Lugb®rz, so he may  like to know what to expect. This is 
line 37215=>going to be more funny than I thought. Let's go!' 
line 37216=>     `There's going to be no fun, I tell  you,' said Shagrat.  'And he's got 
line 37217=>to be kept safe, or we're all as good as dead.' 
line 37218=>     `AII  right! But if I  were you, I'd catch the  big one  that's  loose, 
line 37219=>before you send in any report to Lugb®rz. It  won't sound too pretty  to say 
line 37220=>you've caught the kitten and let the cat escape.' 
line 37221=>     The voices began to move away. Sam heard the sound of feet receding. He 
line 37222=>was recovering from his shock, and now a wild fury was on him. `I got it all  
line 37223=>wrong!  ' he cried. `I knew I  would. Now they've  got him, the  devils! the 
line 37224=>filth! Never leave your master, never,  never: that was my right rule. And I 
line 37225=>knew  it in my heart. May  I be forgiven!  Now I've got to get  back to him. 
line 37226=>Somehow, somehow!  ' 
line 37227=>     He  drew his sword again and  beat on the stone with the  hilt, but  it 
line 37228=>only gave out a dull sound. The sword, however, bla zed so brightly now  that 
line 37229=>he could see dimly  in its light. To his surprise he noticed  that the great 
line 37230=>block was shaped like a heavy door, and  was less than twice his own height. 
line 37231=>Above it was a  dark blank  space between the top and the  low  arch of  the 
line 37232=>opening.  It was probably only meant to be a stop against the  intrusion  of 
line 37233=>Shelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt  beyond the reach  of 
line 37234=>her cunning. With  his  remaining  strength  Sam leaped and caught the  top,  
line 37235=>scrambled up, and dropped;  and  then he ran  madly, sword blazing in  hand, 
line 37236=>round a bend and up a winding tunnel. 
line 37237=>     The news  that his master was still alive roused him  to a  last effort 
line 37238=>beyond thought  of weariness. He could not see anything  ahead. for this new 
line 37239=>passage twisted and turned constantly; but  he thought  he was  catching the  
line 37240=>
line 37241=>####-two Orcs up: their  voices were growing  nearer again. Now they seemed quite 
line 37242=>close. 
line 37243=>     `That's what I'm going  to do,'  said Shagrat in angry tones.  'Put him 
line 37244=>right up in the top chamber.' 
line 37245=>     `What for? ' growled Gorbag. `Haven't you any lock -ups down below? ' 
line 37246=>     `He's  going out of harm's way,  I  tell  you,' answered Shagrat. 'See?  
line 37247=>He's  precious.  I  don't trust  all  my lads,  and  none of yours;  nor you  
line 37248=>neither, when you're mad for fun. He's going where I want him, and where you  
line 37249=>won't come,  if you  don't keep civil. Up to the top,  I  say. He'll be safe 
line 37250=>there.' 
line 37251=>     `Will  he?'  said Sam. 'You're  forgetting the great big elvish warrior  
line 37252=>that's loose!' And with that he raced  round   the last corner, only to  find 
line 37253=>that by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the Ring gave him, 
line 37254=>he had misjudged the distance. 
line 37255=>     The two orc-figures were still some way ahead. He could  see  them now,  
line 37256=>black and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at last, up an 
line 37257=>incline;  and  at  the  end, wide open,  were  great  double doors,  leading 
line 37258=>probably to deep  chambers far below the high horn of the tower. Already the 
line 37259=>Orcs  with their burden  had  passed inside. Gorbag and Shagrat were drawing 
line 37260=>near the gate. 
line 37261=>     Sam  heard a burst  of hoarse singing, blaring of horns  and banging of 
line 37262=>gongs, a hideous clamour. Gorbag and Shagrat were already on the threshold. 
line 37263=>     Sam yelled  and brandished Sting, but his little  voice was  drowned in 
line 37264=>the tumult. No one heeded him. 
line 37265=>     The  great  doors slammed to. Boom.  The bars  of iron fell  into place 
line 37266=>inside. Clang.  The gate was  shut.  Sam  hurled  himself against the bolted 
line 37267=>brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. He  was out in the darkness. 
line 37268=>Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy.

line 37289=>
line 37290=> 
line 37291=> 
line 37292=>     Pippin  looked out from  the shelter of Gandalf's cloak. He wondered if 
line 37293=>he was awake or still sleeping, still in the  swift-moving dream in which he 
line 37294=>had  been  wrapped so long since the  great  ride  began. The dark world was 
line 37295=>rushing by and  the wind sang loudly in his ears. He could  see nothing  but 
line 37296=>the wheeling stars, and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where 
line 37297=>the mountains of the  South  marched past.  Sleepily he tried  to reckon the 
line 37298=>times and stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy and uncertain. 
line 37299=>     There  had been the first  ride at terrible speed without  a  halt, and 
line 37300=>then in the dawn he had  seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had come to the 
line 37301=>silent  town  and the great empty house on  the  hill.  And  hardly had they 
line 37302=>reached its shelter when the winged shadow  had passed  over once again, and 
line 37303=>men wilted with fear. But Gandalf had spoken  soft words to him,  and he had 
line 37304=>slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of  comings  and goings and  
line 37305=>of men talking and Gandalf giving orders. And then  again riding, riding  in 
line 37306=>the  night. This was the second, no, the third night since  he had looked in 
line 37307=>the Stone. And with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered, and the 
line 37308=>noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices.  
line 37309=>     A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers 
line 37310=>Pippin  cowered back, afraid for  a  moment,  wondering  into what  dreadful 
line 37311=>country Gandalf was bearing him. He rubbed his eyes, and then he saw that it 
line 37312=>was the moon rising above the eastern shadows, now  almost at  the full.  So 
line 37313=>the night was not  yet  old and  for hours the dark journey  would go on. He 
line 37314=>stirred and spoke. 
line 37315=>     'Where are we, Gandalf?' he asked. 
line 37316=>     'In the realm of Gondor,' the wizard answered. 'The land  of Anurien is 
line 37317=>still passing by.' 
line 37318=>     There was a silence again  for a  while. Then,  'What  is that?'  cried 
line 37319=>Pippin  suddenly,  clutching at Gandalf's cloak.  'Look! Fire, red fire! Are 
line 37320=>there dragons in this land?  Look, there is another!' 
line 37321=>     For  answer  Gandalf  cried aloud to his horse. 'On, Shadowfax! We must  
line 37322=>
line 37323=>####-hasten. Time is  short.  See! The beacons of Gondor are  alight, calling for  
line 37324=>aid. War  is  kindled.  See,  there is the  fire  on Amon  Don, and flame on 
line 37325=>Eilenach;  and  there they go speeding  west:  Nardol,  Erelas,  Min-Rimmon, 
line 37326=>Calenhad, and the Halifirien on the borders of Rohan.' 
line 37327=>     But Shadowfax  paused in  his stride, slowing  to  a  walk, and then he 
line 37328=>lifted up his head and neighed. And out of the  darkness the answering neigh  
line 37329=>of other  horses came; and  presently the  thudding of hoofs was heard,  and 
line 37330=>three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished  
line 37331=>into the West. Then Shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away, 
line 37332=>and 
line 37333=>the night flowed over him like a roaring wind. 
line 37334=>     Pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to Gandalf telling 
line 37335=>him of the customs of Gondor, and how the Lord of the City had beacons built 
line 37336=>on the tops  of  outlying hills along both border s  of the great  range, and 
line 37337=>maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness 
line 37338=>to bear  his errand-riders to  Rohan in the North,  or  to Belfalas  in  the 
line 37339=>South. 'It is long since the beacons of the North  were lit,' he said;  'and 
line 37340=>in the ancient days of  Gondor they were not needed, for  they had the Seven  
line 37341=>Stones.' Pippin stirred uneasily. 
line 37342=>     'Sleep  again, and do  not be  afraid!' said Gandalf. 'For you are  not 
line 37343=>going like Frodo to  Mordor, but  to Minas Tirith, and there you  will be as 
line 37344=>safe as you can  be anywhere in these days. If Gondor falls, or  the Ring is 
line 37345=>taken, then the Shire will be no refuge.' 
line 37346=>     'You do not comfort me,' said Pippin, but nonetheless  sleep crept over  
line 37347=>him. The last  thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a 
line 37348=>glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds 
line 37349=>as they caught the light of the westering moon. He wondered where Frodo was,  
line 37350=>and if he was already in Mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that 
line 37351=>Frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond Gondor ere the 
line 37352=>coming of the day. 
line 37353=>     Pippin woke  to  the sound of voices. Another day of hiding and a night 
line 37354=>of journey had fleeted by. It was twilight: the cold dawn was at hand again, 
line 37355=>and chill grey mists were about them.  Shadowfax stood  steaming with sweat, 
line 37356=>but he held his neck proudly and showed  no sign of weariness. Many tall men 
line 37357=>heavily cloaked  stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall 
line 37358=>of stone. Partly ruinous  it seemed, but already before the night was passed 
line 37359=>the sound  of  hurried labour  could  be heard:  beat  of hammers,  clink of 
line 37360=>
line 37361=>####-trowels,  and the creak of wheels. Torches and flares glowed dully here  and 
line 37362=>there in the fog. Gandalf was speaking  to the men that  barred his way, and 
line 37363=>as he listened Pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed. 
line 37364=>     'Yea truly, we know you, Mithrandir,' said the leader  of the men, 'and 
line 37365=>you know the pass-words of the  Seven  Gates and are free to go forward. But 
line 37366=>we do not know your companion. What  is he?  A dwarf out of the mountains 
line 37367=>in 
line 37368=>the North? We wish for no strangers in the land at this time, unless they be 
line 37369=>mighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust.' 
line 37370=>     'I will vouch  for him before the seat of Denethor,' said Gandalf. 'And 
line 37371=>as  for valour,  that  cannot be computed by stature. He has  passed through 
line 37372=>more  battles and  perils than you have,  Ingold, though  you  be twice  his 
line 37373=>height; and  he comes  now  from the storming of Isengard,  of which we bear 
line 37374=>tidings,  and great weariness is  on him, or  I would wake him. His name  is 
line 37375=>Peregrin, a very valiant man.' 
line 37376=>     'Man?' said Ingold dubiously; and the others laughed. 
line 37377=>     'Man!' cried Pippin,  now  thoroughly roused.  'Man! Indeed not! I am a  
line 37378=>hobbit and no more valiant  than I am a man,  save perhaps  now and again by 
line 37379=>necessity. Do not let Gandalf deceive you!' 
line 37380=>     'Many a doer of great deeds might say no more,' said Ingold.  'But what 
line 37381=>is a hobbit?' 
line 37382=>     'A Halfling,' answered Gandalf. 'Nay,  not the one that was spoken of,' 
line 37383=>he added seeing  the  wonder  in the  men's  faces. 'Not  he, yet one of his 
line 37384=>kindred.' 
line 37385=>     'Yes, and one  who  journeyed  with him,' said Pippin. 'And  Boromir of 
line 37386=>your City was with us, and he saved me in the snows of the North, and at the  
line 37387=>last he was slain defending me from many foes.' 
line 37388=>     'Peace!'  said Gandalf.  'The news of that grief should have  been told 
line 37389=>first to the father.' 
line 37390=>     'It  has  been  guessed  already,' said  Ingold;  'for there have  been 
line 37391=>strange portents here  of late. But pass  on now  quickly! For  the  Lord of 
line 37392=>Minas Tirith  will be eager to see any that bear the  latest tidings of  his 
line 37393=>son, be he man or --' 
line 37394=>     'Hobbit,' said Pippin.  'Little  service  can I offer to your lord, but 
line 37395=>what I can do, I would do, remembering Boromir the brave.' 
line 37396=>     'Fare you well!' said  Ingold; and the men made way for Shadow fax, and 
line 37397=>he  passed through a narrow gate in the wall. 'May you bring good counsel to 
line 37398=>
line 37399=>####-Denethor  in his need, and  to us all, Mithrandir!' Ingold  cried.  'But you  
line 37400=>come with tidings of grief and danger, as is your wont, they say.' 
line 37401=>     'Because I come seldom but  when my help  is needed,' answered Gandalf.  
line 37402=>'And as for counsel, to you I would  say that you are over -late in repairing 
line 37403=>the wall of the Pelennor. Courage will  now be your best defence against the 
line 37404=>storm that is at  hand - that and such  hope as  I  bring. For not  all  the 
line 37405=>tidings that I  bring are  evil.  But leave your  trowels  and  sharpen your 
line 37406=>swords!' 
line 37407=>     'The work will be finished ere evening, ' said Ingold. 'This is the last  
line 37408=>portion of  the wall  to be put in defence: the least open to attack, for it 
line 37409=>looks  towards our  friends of Rohan.  Do  you know aught of them? Will they 
line 37410=>answer the summons, think you?' 
line 37411=>     'Yes,  they will come. But  they have fought many battles at your back. 
line 37412=>This road and no road looks towards safety  any longer. Be vigilant! But for  
line 37413=>Gandalf Stormcrow you would have seen a host  of foes coming  out of 
line 37414=>Anurien 
line 37415=>and no Riders of Rohan. And you may yet. Fare you well, and sl eep not!' 
line 37416=>     Gandalf passed now into  the wide land  beyond the Rammas Echor. So the 
line 37417=>men of Gondor  called the out  wall that they had  built with great  labour, 
line 37418=>after Ithilien fell under the shadow of their Enemy. For ten leagues or more 
line 37419=>it ran from the  mountains' feet  and so back again, enclosing in its  fence 
line 37420=>the fields of the Pelennor:  fair and fertile townlands  on  the long slopes 
line 37421=>and terraces falling to the deep levels of the Anduin. At its furthest point 
line 37422=>from the  Great Gate of the City, north-eastward, the wall  was four leagues 
line 37423=>distant, and there from a frowning bank  it overlooked the long flats beside 
line 37424=>the river,  and men had  made it high and strong; for at  that point, upon a  
line 37425=>walled causeway, the  road came in from  the fords and bridges  of Osgiliath 
line 37426=>and passed  through a guarded gate between embattled towers. At its  nearest 
line 37427=>point the  wall was little more than one league from the  City, and that was 
line 37428=>south-eastward. There Anduin, going in a  wide knee about the  hills of Emyn 
line 37429=>Arnen in South Ithilien, bent sharply west, and  the out-wall rose  upon its 
line 37430=>very  brink; and beneath  it lay  the quays and  landings of the Harlond for  
line 37431=>craft that came upstream from the southern fiefs.  
line 37432=>     The  townlands  were rich,  with  wide  tilth  and many  orchards,  and 
line 37433=>homesteads there  were with oast  and garner, fold and byre, and  many rills 
line 37434=>rippling through  the  green from the  highlands  down  to Anduin.  Yet  the 
line 37435=>
line 37436=>####-herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many, and the most part 
line 37437=>of 
line 37438=>the people of Gondor lived in the seven circles of the  City, or in the high 
line 37439=>vales of  the  mountain-borders,  in Lossarnach,  or  further south  in fair 
line 37440=>Lebennin with its five swift streams. There dwelt  a  hardy folk between the 
line 37441=>mountains and the sea. They were reckoned men of Gondor, yet their blood 
line 37442=>was 
line 37443=>mingled, and there were short  and swarthy  folk among them whose sires came 
line 37444=>more from the forgotten men who  housed in  the  shadow  of the hills in the 
line 37445=>Dark  Years  ere the coming of the kings. But  beyond,  in the great fief of 
line 37446=>Belfalas, dwelt Prince Imrahil  in  his castle of Dol Amroth by the sea, and 
line 37447=>he was of high blood,  and  his folk also, tall  men and proud with sea -grey 
line 37448=>eyes. 
line 37449=>     Now after Gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the 
line 37450=>sky, and Pippin roused himself and looked up. To his left lay a sea of mist, 
line 37451=>rising  to a  bleak  shadow  in the  East;  but to his right great mountains 
line 37452=>reared their heads, ranging  from the West  to a steep and sudden end, as if 
line 37453=>in  the  making of the land the  River  had burst  through a great  barrier, 
line 37454=>carving  out a mighty valley to be a  land  of battle and debate in times to 
line 37455=>come. And there where the White Mountains of Ered Nimrais  came to their 
line 37456=>end 
line 37457=>he saw, as Gandalf had promised, the dark mass of Mount  Mindolluin, the deep 
line 37458=>purple  shadows of its high glens, and its tall face whitening in the rising 
line 37459=>day. And upon its out-thrust knee was the Guarded City, with its seven walls 
line 37460=>of stone  so  strong and  old that  it seemed to have been  not builded  but 
line 37461=>carven by giants out of the bones of the earth. 
line 37462=>     Even  as Pippin gazed in wonder the walls  passed from  looming grey to 
line 37463=>white, blushing faintly in  the dawn;  and suddenly the sun climbed over the 
line 37464=>eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that  smote the face of the City. Then 
line 37465=>Pippin cried aloud, for the Tower  of  Ecthelion, standing high  within  the 
line 37466=>topmost walls' shone  out against the  sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl 
line 37467=>and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle  glittered as if  it 
line 37468=>were wrought of crystals;  and white  banners  broke and  fluttered from the 
line 37469=>battlements in the morning breeze' and high and far he heard a clear ringing 
line 37470=>as of silver trumpets. 
line 37471=>     So Gandalf and Peregrin rode to the Great Gate  of the Men of Gondor at 
line 37472=>the rising of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them. 
line 37473=>
line 37474=>####-     'Mithrandir!  Mithrandir!' men  cried. 'Now we know that  the  storm is 
line 37475=>indeed nigh!' 
line 37476=>     'It is upon you,' said  Gandalf. 'I  have  ridden  on its wings. Let me 
line 37477=>pass!  I  must come  to  your  Lord Denethor, while his  stewardship  lasts.  
line 37478=>Whatever betide, you have come to the end of the Gondor that you have 
line 37479=>known. 
line 37480=>Let me pass!' 
line 37481=>     Then men  fell back before the command of his voice  and questioned him 
line 37482=>no further, though  they gazed in wonder  at the hobbit that sat before  him 
line 37483=>and at the horse that bore him. For the people of  the City used horses very 
line 37484=>little and they were seldom seen in their streets, save only those ridden by  
line 37485=>the errand-riders of their  lord. And they said: 'Surely that is one  of the 
line 37486=>great steeds of the  King  of  Rohan?  Maybe  the Rohirrim will come soon to 
line 37487=>strengthen us.' But Shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road. 
line 37488=>     For the  fashion  of  Minas Tirith was such that it was built on  seven 
line 37489=>levels,  each  delved into the hill, and about each  was set a  wall, and in 
line 37490=>each wall was a  gate. But the gates were not set in a line:  the Great Gate 
line 37491=>in the City Wall was at  the  east  point of the circuit, but the next faced 
line 37492=>half south, and the third half north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the 
line 37493=>paved  way that climbed towards  the Citadel turned  first this way and then 
line 37494=>that across the face of  the hill. And each  time that it passed the line of 
line 37495=>the  Great Gate it went through an  arched  tunnel, piercing a  vast pier of 
line 37496=>rock whose  huge out-thrust bulk  divided in two all the circles of the City 
line 37497=>save the first. For partly in  the  primeval shaping  of the hill, partly by 
line 37498=>the mighty craft and labour of old, there stood up from the rear of the wide 
line 37499=>court behind the  Gate a  towering  bastion  of stone, its edge sharp  as  a  
line 37500=>ship-keel facing east. Up it rose, even to the level of the  topmost circle, 
line 37501=>and there was crowned  by  a battlement; so that those in the Citadel might, 
line 37502=>like mariners in a mountainous ship, look  from  its peak sheer down upon the 
line 37503=>Gate  seven  hundred  feet  below.  The entrance  to the Citadel also looked 
line 37504=>eastward,  but  was delved in the  heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit 
line 37505=>slope ran up to the seventh gate. Thus  men reached  at last the High Court, 
line 37506=>and the Place of the  Fountain before the feet of the  White Tower: tall and 
line 37507=>shapely,  fifty fathoms from its  base to the pinnacle, where the banner  of 
line 37508=>the Stewards floated a thousand feet above the plain. 
line 37509=>     A  strong citadel  it was indeed,  and  not to be taken  by  a  host of 
line 37510=>enemies, if  there were any within that could hold weapons;  unless some foe 
line 37511=>
line 37512=>####-could come behind and scale the lower skirts of Mindolluin, and so come upon 
line 37513=>the narrow shoulder that joined the Hill of Guard to the mountain  mass. But 
line 37514=>that shoulder, which rose to  the height of the fifth wall, was hedged  with 
line 37515=>great ramparts right up to the precipice that overhung its western end;  and 
line 37516=>in that  space stood the houses and  domed tombs of bygone kings  and lords, 
line 37517=>for ever silent between the mountain and the tower. 
line 37518=>     Pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and more 
line 37519=>splendid  than  anything that he had dreamed of;  greater and  stronger than 
line 37520=>Isengard, and far more beautiful.  Yet it was in truth falling year by  year 
line 37521=>into decay; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease 
line 37522=>there. In  every street they passed  some  great house or  court  over whose 
line 37523=>doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters  of strange and ancient  
line 37524=>shapes: names Pippin  guessed of great men and kindreds that had once  dwelt 
line 37525=>there;  and  yet now they were silent,  and no footsteps rang  on their wide 
line 37526=>pavements, nor voice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out  from 
line 37527=>door or empty window.  
line 37528=>     At last they came out of  shadow to the seventh gate,  and the warm sun 
line 37529=>that shone down beyond the river, as Frodo walked in the glades of Ithilien, 
line 37530=>glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and the great arch  with  
line 37531=>keystone  carven  in  the  likeness of a crowned and  kingly  head.  Gandalf 
line 37532=>dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the Citadel,  and Shadowfax suffered 
line 37533=>himself to be led away at the soft word of his master. 
line 37534=>     The Guards of the gate  were robed  in black, and  their helms  were of 
line 37535=>strange  shape, high-crowned,  with long cheek -guards  close-fitting to  the 
line 37536=>face,  and above the cheek -guards were set the white wings of sea -birds; but 
line 37537=>the helms gleamed with a  flame of silver, for they were indeed  wrought  of 
line 37538=>mithril, heirlooms from the glory of old days. Upon  the black surcoats were 
line 37539=>embroidered in white a tree blossoming like  snow beneath a silver crown and 
line 37540=>many-pointed  stars. This  was the livery of the heirs of  Elendil, and none 
line 37541=>wore it now in all Gondor,  save the Guards of the Citadel  before the Court 
line 37542=>of the Fountain where the White Tree once had grown. 
line 37543=>     Already it  seemed that word of their coming had  gone before them: and 
line 37544=>at once they were admitted,  silently, and without question. Quickly Gandalf 
line 37545=>strode across  the white-paved court.  A  sweet fountain played there in the 
line 37546=>morning sun,  and a  sward of bright green  lay about it; but in the  midst. 
line 37547=>drooping over the pool,  stood  a dead  tree, and  the falling drops dripped 
line 37548=>sadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water. 
line 37549=>
line 37550=>####-     Pippin glanced at  it  as he hurried after Gandalf. It looked mournful, 
line 37551=>he thought, and he wondered why the dead tree was  left in  this place where 
line 37552=>everything else was well tended. 
line 37553=>     Seven stars and seven stones and one white tree. 
line 37554=>     The words that Gandalf had murmured came back into  his mind. And  then 
line 37555=>he found himself at the doors of  the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; 
line 37556=>and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door -wardens and entered the 
line 37557=>cool echoing shadows of the house of stone. 
line 37558=>     They walked  down  a paved passage, long and  empty, and  as  they went 
line 37559=>Gandalf spoke softly to Pippin. 'Be careful of your  words, Master Peregrin!  
line 37560=>This is  no time for  hobbit pertness. Thjoden is a kindly old man. Denethor  
line 37561=>is of another  sort, proud and subtle,  a  man  of far  greater  lineage and 
line 37562=>power, though  he is  not called a king. But he will  speak most to you, and 
line 37563=>question you much, since you  can tell him  of his son Boromir. He loved him 
line 37564=>greatly: too much  perhaps; and the more  so because they  were  unlike. But 
line 37565=>under cover  of  this love he will think it easier to  learn what he witches 
line 37566=>from you rather than  from me. Do not tell him more than you need, and leave 
line 37567=>quiet  the matter of Frodo's errand. I will deal with that in due  time. And 
line 37568=>say nothing about Aragorn either, unless you must.' 
line 37569=>     'Why  not? What is wrong with Strider?' Pippin  whispered. 'He meant to 
line 37570=>come here, didn't he? And he'll be arriving soon himself anyway.' 
line 37571=>     'Maybe,  maybe,' said Gandalf. 'Though if he comes, it is likely  to be 
line 37572=>in some way that no one expects, not even Denethor. It will be better so. At 
line 37573=>least he should come unheralded by us.' 
line 37574=>     Gandalf halted  before a  tall  door of  polished  metal. 'See,  Master  
line 37575=>Pippin,  there  is no  t ime to instruct  you now in  the history of  Gondor; 
line 37576=>though it might have been  better, if you  had learned something of it, when 
line 37577=>you were  still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods  of the Shire. 
line 37578=>Do as I bid! It  is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his 
line 37579=>heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the  coming of one who  will, if 
line 37580=>he comes, claim the kingship. Is that enough?' 
line 37581=>     'Kingship?' said Pippin amazed. 
line 37582=>     'Yes,' said  Gandalf.  'If you  have  walked all these days with closed 
line 37583=>ears and mind asleep, wake up now!' He knocked on the door. 
line 37584=>     The door opened,  but no one could be  seen  to open it.  Pippin looked 
line 37585=>into a great hall. It was  lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at  either  
line 37586=>side, beyond  the rows of tall  pillars that upheld the  roof. Monoliths  of 
line 37587=>
line 37588=>####-black marble, they  rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of 
line 37589=>beasts and leaves; and far above in  shadow  the wide  vaulting gleamed with 
line 37590=>dull  gold, inset with  flowing traceries of  many colours. No  hangings nor  
line 37591=>storied webs, nor  any things of woven stuff or  of wood, were to be seen in 
line 37592=>that long solemn hall; but between the pillars there stood  a silent company 
line 37593=>of tall images graven in cold stone. 
line 37594=>     Suddenly Pippin was  reminded  of  the hewn rocks of  Argonath, and awe 
line 37595=>fell on him, as he looked down  that  avenue of kings  long dead. At the far 
line 37596=>end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble 
line 37597=>shaped like a crowned helm; behind  it was carved upon the wall and set with 
line 37598=>gems an image of a tree  in flower. But the throne was empty. At the foot of 
line 37599=>the dais, upon the lowest step which was broad and deep, there  was  a stone 
line 37600=>chair,  black and unadorned, and on it sat an  old man gazing at his lap. In 
line 37601=>his hand was a  white rod  with a  golden knob. He did not look up. Solemnly 
line 37602=>they paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces from his 
line 37603=>footstool. Then Gandalf spoke. 
line 37604=>     'Hail, Lord  and Steward of Minas Tirith,  Denethor son of Ecthelion! I 
line 37605=>am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.' 
line 37606=>     Then  the old  man looked up. Pippin saw his carven face with its proud 
line 37607=>bones  and skin like ivory, and the long  curved nose between  the dark deep 
line 37608=>eyes; and he was reminded not so much of Boromir as of Aragor n.  'Dark 
line 37609=>indeed 
line 37610=>is the hour,' said  the old  man, 'and  at such times you are  wont to come, 
line 37611=>Mithrandir.  But though all  the  signs forebode that the  doom of Gondor is 
line 37612=>drawing  nigh, less now to me is  that darkness than my own darkness. It has 
line 37613=>been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die. Is this he?' 
line 37614=>     'It is,' said Gandalf. 'One  of the twain. The other is with Thjoden of 
line 37615=>Rohan and may come hereafter.  Halflings  they are,  as you see, yet this is 
line 37616=>not he of whom the omens spoke.' 
line 37617=>     'Yet  a  Halfling still,' said Denethor  grimly, 'and little love do  I 
line 37618=>bear the name, since those  accursed words  came to trouble our counsels and 
line 37619=>drew away my son on the  wild errand to his  death. My Boromir!  Now we 
line 37620=>have 
line 37621=>need of you. Faramir should have gone in his stead.' 
line 37622=>     'He would  have  gone,' said  Gandalf.  'Be not unjust  in your  grief!  
line 37623=>Boromir claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. He was 
line 37624=>a masterful man, and one  to take what he desired. I journeyed far  with him 
line 37625=>
line 37626=>####-and learned much of  his mood. But you speak of his death. You have had news 
line 37627=>of that ere we came?' 
line 37628=>     'I  have received  this,'  said Denethor, and laying  down his  rod  he 
line 37629=>lifted from his lap the  thing that  he had been gazing at.  In each hand he 
line 37630=>held up one half  of a great  horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn 
line 37631=>bound with silver. 
line 37632=>     'That is the horn that Boromir always wore!' cried Pippin. 
line 37633=>     'Verily,'  said  Denethor. 'And in  my turn  I bore it, and so did each 
line 37634=>eldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing 
line 37635=>of the kings, since  Vorondil father  of Mardil hunted the wild kine of Araw 
line 37636=>in the  far fields of Rhyn. I heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches 
line 37637=>thirteen  days ago, and the River brought  it to me, broken: it will wind no 
line 37638=>more.' He paused and there was a heavy silence. Suddenly he turned his black 
line 37639=>glance upon Pippin. 'What say you to that, Halfling?' 
line 37640=>     'Thirteen, thirteen days,' faltered Pippin. 'Yes, I think that would be 
line 37641=>so. Yes, I stood beside him,  as he blew the  horn. But  no help  came. Only 
line 37642=>more orcs.' 
line 37643=>     'So,' said  Denethor, looking keenly at Pippin's face. 'You were there?  
line 37644=>Tell me more! Why did no help  come? And how  did you escape, and yet he 
line 37645=>did 
line 37646=>not, so mighty a man as he wa s, and only orcs to withstand him?' 
line 37647=>     Pippin flushed and forgot his fear. 'The mightiest man may be slain  by 
line 37648=>one arrow,'  he said; 'and Boromir was pierced by  many. When last I saw him 
line 37649=>he sank  beside  a tree and plucked a black -feathered shaft  from  his side. 
line 37650=>Then I swooned  and was made  captive. I saw him no more, and know  no 
line 37651=>more. 
line 37652=>But I honour his memory,  for he was very  valiant.  He died to save  us, my 
line 37653=>kinsman Meriadoc and myself, waylaid in the woods by  the  soldiery  of  the 
line 37654=>Dark Lord; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is none the less.' 
line 37655=>     Then Pippin looked the old man in  the eye, for pride stirred strangely 
line 37656=>within  him, still stung  by  the scorn  and suspicion in that  cold  voice. 
line 37657=>'Little service, no  doubt, will so great a lord of Men  think to  find in a  
line 37658=>hobbit, a halfling from the northern Shire; yet such as it is, I  will offer  
line 37659=>it,  in payment  of my  debt.'  Twitching  aside his grey cloak, Pippin drew 
line 37660=>forth his small sword and laid it at Denethor's feet. 
line 37661=>     A pale smile, like a gleam of  cold sun  on a winter's evening,  passed 
line 37662=>over the old man's face; but he  bent his head and held out his hand, laying 
line 37663=>
line 37664=>####-the shards of the horn aside. 'Give me the weapon!' he said. 
line 37665=>     Pippin lifted it  and presented the hilt  to him.   'Whence  came this?' 
line 37666=>said Denethor.  'Many, many years lie on it.  Surely this is a blade wrought 
line 37667=>by our own kindred in the North in the deep past?' 
line 37668=>     'It came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country ' said 
line 37669=>Pippin.  'But only evil wights dwell there now, and I will not willingly tell  
line 37670=>more of them.' 
line 37671=>     'I see that strange tales  are woven about you,'  said  Denethor,  'and 
line 37672=>once again it  is shown  that looks may belie the man  -  or the  halfling. I 
line 37673=>accept  your  service.  For you  are not  daunted  by  words;  and you  have 
line 37674=>courteous  speech, strange though the sound of it may be to us in the South. 
line 37675=>And we shall have  need of all folk of courtesy, be they great  or small, in 
line 37676=>the days to come. Swear to me now!' 
line 37677=>     'Take the hilt,' said Gandalf,  'and speak after the Lord, if  you  are 
line 37678=>resolved on this.' 
line 37679=>     'I am,' said Pippin. 
line 37680=>     The  old man laid  the  sword along his lap, and Pippin put his hand to 
line 37681=>the hilt, and said slowly after Denethor: 
line 37682=>     'Here do I swear  fealty and  service  to  Gondor, and  to the Lord and 
line 37683=>Steward of the realm, to  speak and to be silent,  to do and  to let be,  to 
line 37684=>come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from 
line 37685=>this hour  henceforth, until my  lord  release me, or death take me , or  the 
line 37686=>world end. So say I, Peregrin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.' 
line 37687=>     And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord  of Gondor, Steward 
line 37688=>of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is 
line 37689=>given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath - breaking with vengeance.' 
line 37690=>Then Pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath. 
line 37691=>     'And now,' said  Denethor, 'my first command  to you: speak and be  not 
line 37692=>silent! Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that  you can of 
line 37693=>Boromir, my son. Sit now and begin!' As he  spoke  he  struck a small silver  
line 37694=>gong  that  stood  near his footstool,  and at  once  servants came forward. 
line 37695=>Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the 
line 37696=>door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered. 
line 37697=>     'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,' said Denethor, 'and see 
line 37698=>that none trouble us for one hour.' 
line 37699=>     'It is all that  I have to spare,  for there is  much else to heed,' he 
line 37700=>said  to Gandalf.  'Much of more import,  it  may seem,  and yet to  me less 
line 37701=>
line 37702=>####-pressing. But maybe we can speak again at the end of the day.' 
line 37703=>     'And earlier, it is to  be hoped,' said Gandalf. 'For I have not ridden 
line 37704=>hither from Isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind,  
line 37705=>only to bring you one small warrior, however courteous.  Is it naught to you  
line 37706=>that Thjoden has fought a great battle and  that Isengard is overthrown, and 
line 37707=>that I have broken the staff of Saruman?' 
line 37708=>     'It is much to me. But I know already  sufficient of these deeds for my 
line 37709=>own  counsel  against  the menace of the East.' He turned his  dark  eyes on 
line 37710=>Gandalf, and now  Pippin  saw a likeness between  the  two, and he  felt the 
line 37711=>strain between them,  almost as if  he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn 
line 37712=>from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame. 
line 37713=>     Denethor  looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did, 
line 37714=>more kingly,  beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet  by a sense other than 
line 37715=>sight  Pippin perceived that  Gandalf had  the greater power and the  deeper 
line 37716=>wisdom, and a majesty that  was veiled.  And he was  older, far older.  'How 
line 37717=>much older?' he wondered, and  then  he thought  how odd it was that he  had 
line 37718=>never thought about it before. Treebeard had  said  something about wizards, 
line 37719=>but even  then  he  had  not  thought of Gandalf as  one  of them. What  was 
line 37720=>Gandalf? In what  far  time and place did he come  into  the world, and when 
line 37721=>would he leave it? And  then his musings broke off, and he saw that Denethor  
line 37722=>and Gandalf  still looked each other in the eye, as if  reading the  other's 
line 37723=>mind. But it was Denethor who first withdrew his gaze. 
line 37724=>     'Yea,' he  said; 'for though  the Stones  be lost, they say,  still the 
line 37725=>lords of Gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come 
line 37726=>to 
line 37727=>them. But sit now!' 
line 37728=>     Then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver  
line 37729=>with  a  silver flagon  and cups,  and  white cakes. Pippin sat down, but he 
line 37730=>could  not  take his eyes  from  the  old lord.  Was it so, or  had  he only 
line 37731=>imagined it, that  as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam  of his  eye had 
line 37732=>glanced upon Pippin's face?  
line 37733=>     'Now tell  me your tale,  my  liege,' said Denethor, half  kindly; half 
line 37734=>mockingly. 'For the words  of one whom my son so befriended will be  
line 37735=>welcome 
line 37736=>indeed.' 
line 37737=>     Pippin never forgot that hour in the great  hall under the piercing eye 
line 37738=>of the Lord of  Gondor,  stabbed ever and anon by his  shrewd questions, and 
line 37739=>
line 37740=>####-all the while conscious of  Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and 
line 37741=>(so Pippin felt) holding  in check a rising  wrath and impatience.  When the 
line 37742=>hour was  over and Denethor again rang  the gong, Pippin felt worn out.  'It 
line 37743=>cannot  be  more  than  nine o'clock,'  he thought.  'I  could now eat three 
line 37744=>breakfasts on end.' 
line 37745=>     'Lead  the  Lord  Mithrandir  to  the housing prepared for  him,'  said 
line 37746=>Denethor, 'and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will.  
line 37747=>But  be it known that  I have  now sworn him to  my service, and he shall be 
line 37748=>known as Peregrin son of Paladin and taught the lesser pass-words. Send word 
line 37749=>to the Captains that they shall wait on me here, as soon as may be after the 
line 37750=>third hour has rung. 
line 37751=>     'And  you,  my Lord  Mithrandir, shall come too, as and when  you will. 
line 37752=>None shall hinder your coming to me at any time, save only in my brief hours 
line 37753=>of sleep. Let your wrath at an old man's folly run off and then return to my 
line 37754=>comfort!' 
line 37755=>     'Folly?'  said  Gandalf. 'Nay,  my lord, when you are a dotard you will 
line 37756=>die. You can  use  even your grief as  a cloak.  Do you  think that I do not 
line 37757=>understand your purpose in  questioning for an hour one who knows the least, 
line 37758=>while I sit by?' 
line 37759=>     'If you understand  it,  then  be  content,' returned  Denethor. 'Pride 
line 37760=>would  be  folly that disdained help and counsel  at need; but you deal  out 
line 37761=>such gifts according to your own designs. Yet  the Lord of Gondor  is not to  
line 37762=>be made the tool  of other men's purposes, however worthy. And to  him there 
line 37763=>is no purpose higher  in the world as it now stands than the good of Gondor;  
line 37764=>and the rule  of Gondor, my lord, is mine and no other man's, unless the king  
line 37765=>should come again.' 
line 37766=>     'Unless  the  king  should  come  again?' said Gandalf. 'Well,  my lord 
line 37767=>Steward,  it is  your task  to keep some  kingdom still against  that event, 
line 37768=>which few now look to see. In that task you shall have all  the aid that you  
line 37769=>are pleased to ask for.  But  I will say this: the rule of no realm is mine, 
line 37770=>neither of Gondor nor any other, great or small.  But all worthy things that 
line 37771=>are in peril as the world now stands,  those are my care. And for my part, I 
line 37772=>shall  not wholly  fail of my task, though Gondor should perish, if anything 
line 37773=>passes through this night that  can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower  
line 37774=>again in days to come. For I also am a steward.  Did you not know?' And with 
line 37775=>that he turned and strode from the hall with Pippin running at his side. 
line 37776=>     Gandalf  did not  look  at Pippin or  speak a word to him as they went. 
line 37777=>
line 37778=>####-Their  guide brought them from  the doors  of  the hall, and  then  led them 
line 37779=>across  the  Court  of the  Fountain into a lane  between  tall buildings of 
line 37780=>stone. After  several turns  they came to a house close to the wall  of  the 
line 37781=>citadel upon the north side, not far from the shoulder that linked the  hill 
line 37782=>with  the mountain. Within, upon the first floor above the street, up a wide 
line 37783=>carven  stair,  he showed  them to a fair room, light  and airy, with goodly  
line 37784=>hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured. It  was sparely furnished, having but 
line 37785=>a  small table,  two chairs and a  bench;  but  at  either side  ther e  were 
line 37786=>curtained alcoves  and  well -clad beds  within with  vessels  and basins for  
line 37787=>washing. There were three high narrow windows that looked northward over 
line 37788=>the 
line 37789=>great  curve of  Anduin, still shrouded in  mists, towards the Emyn Muil and 
line 37790=>Rauros  far away.  Pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep 
line 37791=>stone sill. 
line 37792=>     'Are you angry with me, Gandalf?' he  said, as their guide went out and 
line 37793=>closed the door. 'I did the best I could.' 
line 37794=>     'You did  indeed!' said Gandalf,  laughing suddenly; and  he  came  and 
line 37795=>stood beside Pippin, putting his arm about the hobbit's shoulders and gazing 
line 37796=>out  of the window.  Pippin glanced in  some  wonder  at the face now  close 
line 37797=>beside his own, for the  sound of that laugh had been gay and merry.  Yet in  
line 37798=>the wizard's  face he saw  at first only lines of care and sorrow; though as 
line 37799=>he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a  
line 37800=>fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth. 
line 37801=>     'Indeed you did your best,' said the wizard; 'and I hope that it may be 
line 37802=>long  before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such 
line 37803=>terrible old  men.  Still the Lord of Gondor  learned more from you than you  
line 37804=>may have  guessed, Pippin. You  could not hide the fact that Bor omir did not 
line 37805=>lead the Company from Moria, and that there was one among you of high 
line 37806=>honour 
line 37807=>who was coming  to Minas Tirith;  and that  he had a famous sword. Men think  
line 37808=>much about the stories of  old  days in Gondor;  and Denethor has given long 
line 37809=>thought  to the rhyme and to  the words  Isildur's  Bane, since Boromir went 
line 37810=>away. 
line 37811=>     'He  is not as other  men  of  this  time,  Pippin, and whatever be his 
line 37812=>descent  from  father  to son, by some chance the blood  of Westernesse runs 
line 37813=>nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, Faramir, and yet did not in 
line 37814=>Boromir whom he  loved best. He has long sight. He can perceive, if he bends 
line 37815=>
line 37816=>####-his will thither, much of what is passing in the minds of men, even of those 
line 37817=>that dwell far off. It is difficult to deceive him, and dangerous to try. 
line 37818=>     'Remember that! For you  are  now  sworn to his  service. I do not know 
line 37819=>what put it into your head, or your heart, to do that. But it was well done. 
line 37820=>I  did not hinder  it,  for  generous deed should  not  be  checked  by cold 
line 37821=>counsel.  It  touched  his  heart,  as  well (may I  say it) as pleasing his 
line 37822=>humour. And at least you are free  now  to move  about as  you will in Minas 
line 37823=>Tirith - when you are not on  duty. For there is another side to it. You are 
line 37824=>at his command; and he will not  forget. Be wary still!' 
line 37825=>     He fell silent and sighed. 'Well, no need to brood on what tomorrow may 
line 37826=>bring. For  one thing, tomorrow will  be certain to bring  worse than today, 
line 37827=>for many days  to  come. And there is nothing more that I can do to help it. 
line 37828=>The board is set, and the pieces are moving. One piece that I greatly desire 
line 37829=>to find is Faramir, now the heir of Denethor.  I do not think  that he is in 
line 37830=>the City; but I have had no  time to gather news. I must go.  Pippin. I must  
line 37831=>go to this lords' council and learn what I  can. But the Enemy has the move, 
line 37832=>and he is about to open his full game.  And pawns are likely to see  as much  
line 37833=>of it  as  any,  Peregrin son of Paladin,  soldier  of  Gondor. Sharpen your 
line 37834=>blade!' 
line 37835=>     Gandalf went to the door, and there he turned. 'I  am in haste Pippin,' 
line 37836=>he said. 'Do  me a favour when you go out. Even before you rest, if you  are 
line 37837=>not too weary. Go and find Shadowfax and see how  he is housed. These 
line 37838=>people 
line 37839=>are kindly to beasts, for they are a good  and wise folk, but they have less 
line 37840=>skill with horses than some.' 
line 37841=>     With that Gandalf went out;  and as he did so, there came the note of a  
line 37842=>clear sweet bell ringing in  a tower of  the citadel. Three strokes it rang, 
line 37843=>like silver in  the  air, and ceased: the third hour from the rising of  the 
line 37844=>sun. 
line 37845=>     After a minute Pippin went to  the door and  down the stair  and looked 
line 37846=>about the street. The sun was now  shining warm and bright,  and the  towers 
line 37847=>and tall houses cast long  clear-cut shadows westward.  High in the blue air 
line 37848=>Mount Mindolluin lifted its  white helm and snowy cloak.  Armed men  went to 
line 37849=>and fro in the ways of  the City, as if going at the striking of the hour to 
line 37850=>changes of post and duty. 
line 37851=>     'Nine o'clock we'd call it in the Shire,' said Pippin aloud to himself.  
line 37852=>'Just  the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring  sunshine. 
line 37853=>
line 37854=>####-And  how I  should like  breakfast! Do these  people ever  have it, or is it 
line 37855=>over? And when do they have dinner, and where?' 
line 37856=>     Presently he noticed a man, clad  in  black and white, coming along the 
line 37857=>narrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. Pippin felt lonely 
line 37858=>and made up his mind to speak as the man passed; but he had no need. The man 
line 37859=>came straight up to him. 
line 37860=>     'You are Peregrin the Halfling?' he said. 'I am told that you have been 
line 37861=>sworn to the  service of the  Lord and of the City. Welcome! He held out his 
line 37862=>hand and Pippin took it. 
line 37863=>     'I am named Beregond son of Baranor. I have no duty this morning, and I  
line 37864=>have been sent  to you to teach you the pass-words, and to  tell you some of 
line 37865=>the many things that  no doubt you  will  wish to know. And  for my part,  I 
line 37866=>would learn of you also.  For  never before have  we seen a halfling in this 
line 37867=>land and though we have heard rumour of them, little is said of them in  any 
line 37868=>tale that we know. Moreover you are a friend of Mithrandir.  Do you know him 
line 37869=>well?' 
line 37870=>     'Well,' said Pippin.  'I  have known of  him all my short  life, as you  
line 37871=>might say; and lately  I have travelled far with him. But there  is  much to 
line 37872=>read in that book, and I cannot claim to have seen more  than a page or two.  
line 37873=>Yet perhaps I know him as well as any but a few. Aragorn was the only one of 
line 37874=>our Company, I think, who really knew him.' 
line 37875=>     'Aragorn?' said Beregond. 'Who is he?' 
line 37876=>     'Oh,' stammered  Pippin, 'he was a  man who went  about with us. I think  
line 37877=>he is in Rohan now.' 
line 37878=>     'You have  been in Rohan, I hear. There is much that I would ask you of 
line 37879=>that land also;  for we put much of what little hope we have  in its people. 
line 37880=>But I am forgetting my errand, which was first to answer what you would ask. 
line 37881=>What would you know, Master Peregrin?' 
line 37882=>     'Er well,' said Pippin, 'if I may venture to  say so, rather  a burning 
line 37883=>question  in my mind at present is, well, what about breakfast and all that?  
line 37884=>I mean, what  are  the  meal-times, if you  understand me, and where is  the 
line 37885=>dining-room, if there is one?  And the inns? I looked, but never a one could 
line 37886=>I see as we rode up, though I had been borne up by the hope of a draught  of 
line 37887=>ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men.' 
line 37888=>     Beregond looked at him  gravely. 'An old campaigner,  I see,'  he said. 
line 37889=>'They say that men who go warring afield look ever to the next  hope of food 
line 37890=>and of drink; though I am not a travelled man myself. Then you have not  yet 
line 37891=>
line 37892=>####-eaten today?' 
line 37893=>     'Well, yes,  to speak in courtesy, yes,' said Pippin. 'But no more than 
line 37894=>a cup of wine  and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord; but  he 
line 37895=>racked me for it with an hour of questions, and that is hungry work.' 
line 37896=>     Beregond laughed. 'At the table small men may  do the greater deeds, we 
line 37897=>say. But you  have broken  your fast  as well as any man in the Citadel, and 
line 37898=>with  greater honour. This is a fortress and a tower  of guard and is now in 
line 37899=>posture  of war. We rise ere the Sun, and take  a morsel in the grey  light, 
line 37900=>and go  to our duties  at  the opening hour. But do not despair!' He laughed 
line 37901=>again,  seeing the  dismay in Pippin's  face. 'Those who have had heavy duty 
line 37902=>take somewhat  to refresh  their strength  in the mid-morning. Then there is 
line 37903=>the  nuncheon,  at noon or  after as  duties allow; and men  gather for  the 
line 37904=>daymeal, and such mirth as there still may be, about the hour of sunset. 
line 37905=>     'Come! We will walk a little and then go find us  some refreshment, and 
line 37906=>eat and drink on the battlement, and survey the fair morning.' 
line 37907=>     'One moment!' said Pippin blushing. 'Greed, or hunger by your courtesy,  
line 37908=>put it out of my mind. But Gandalf, Mithrandir as you call  him, asked me to 
line 37909=>see to his horse  - Shadowfax,  a  great steed of Rohan, and the apple of the 
line 37910=>king's  eye, I  am told, though he  has  given  him  to  Mithrandir  for his 
line 37911=>services. I think his new master loves the beast  better than  he loves many 
line 37912=>men, and if his  good  will is  of  any value to this  city,  you will treat 
line 37913=>Shadowfax with all honour: with greater  kindness than you have treated this 
line 37914=>hobbit, if it is possible.' 
line 37915=>     'Hobbit?' said Beregond. 
line 37916=>     'That is what we call ourselves,' said Pippin. 
line 37917=>     'I am glad to learn it,' said Beregond, 'for now I may say that strange 
line 37918=>accents  do not   mar fair speech,  and hobbits are  a  fair-spoken folk. But 
line 37919=>come! You shall make me acquainted with this good  horse. I love beasts, and 
line 37920=>we  see  them  seldom  in this  stony city;  for my  people  came  from  the 
line 37921=>mountain-vales, and before that from Ithilien. But fear not! The visit shall 
line 37922=>be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butteries.' 
line 37923=>     Pippin found that Shadowfax had been well housed and tended. For in the 
line 37924=>sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables 
line 37925=>where  a   few  swift  horses  were  kept,  hard  by  the  lodgings  of  the 
line 37926=>errand-riders of  the  Lord: messengers always ready  to  go at  the  urgent 
line 37927=>command of Denethor or his  chief  captains. But  now all the horses and the  
line 37928=>riders were out and away. 
line 37929=>
line 37930=>####-     Shadowfax  whinnied as Pippin  entered the stable and  turned his head. 
line 37931=>'Good morning!'  said Pippin.  'Gandalf will come  as soon as  he may. He is 
line 37932=>busy, but he sends greetings, and I am to see that all is well with you; and 
line 37933=>you resting, I hope, after your long labours.' 
line 37934=>     Shadowfax  tossed  his  head  and  stamped. But he allowed  Beregond to 
line 37935=>handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks. 
line 37936=>     'He looks  as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a  
line 37937=>great journey,' said Beregond. 'How  strong and proud  he is!  Where  is his 
line 37938=>harness? It should be rich and fair.' 
line 37939=>     'None is  rich  and fair  enough for him,' said Pippin.  'He will  have 
line 37940=>none. If he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no 
line 37941=>bit, bridle,  whip,  or  thong  will  tame  him.  Farewell, Shadowfax!  Have 
line 37942=>patience. Battle is coming.' 
line 37943=>     Shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and 
line 37944=>they covered their ears.  Then they took their leave, seeing that the manger  
line 37945=>was well filled. 
line 37946=>     'And now for our  manger,' said Beregond, and he led Pippin back to the 
line 37947=>citadel, and so  to a door in the north side of the great tower. There  they 
line 37948=>went  down a  long  cool stair into a  wide alley lit with lamps. There were 
line 37949=>hatches in the walls at the side, and one of these was open. 
line 37950=>     'This  is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the  Guard.' said 
line 37951=>Beregond.  'Greetings,  Targon!' he called through the hatch.  'It  is early 
line 37952=>yet, but here is a newcomer that the Lord has taken into his service. He has 
line 37953=>ridden long and far with a tight belt, and has had sore labour this morning, 
line 37954=>and he is hungry. Give us what you have!' 
line 37955=>     They got there bread, and butter, and cheese  and  apples:  the last of 
line 37956=>the  winter store,  wrinkled but  sound and sweet;  and a leather flagon  of 
line 37957=>new-drawn ale, and  wooden platters  and cups. They put  all into  a  wicker  
line 37958=>basket and climbed back into the sun; and Beregond brought Pippin to a place 
line 37959=>at  the  east  end of  the  great out-thrust battlement where  there was  an 
line 37960=>embrasure in  the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill. From there  they 
line 37961=>could look out on the morning over the world. 
line 37962=>     They  ate  and drank; and they  talked now of  Gondor and its  ways and 
line 37963=>customs, now  of the Shire and the strange countries that  Pippin  had seen. 
line 37964=>And ever as they talked Beregond  was more amazed,  and looked with  greater  
line 37965=>wonder  at the  hobbit, swinging his short  legs as he sat  on the seat,  or  
line 37966=>standing tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below. 
line 37967=>
line 37968=>####-     'I will not hide from you, Master Peregrin,' said Beregond, 'that to us 
line 37969=>you look almost as one of our children, a lad of nine summers or so; and yet  
line 37970=>you have endured  perils  and seen marvels that few of our  greybeards could 
line 37971=>boast of. I thought  it was the whim of  our Lord to take him  a noble page, 
line 37972=>after the manner of the kings of old, they say. But I see that it is not so, 
line 37973=>and you must pardon my foolishness.' 
line 37974=>     'I do,' said Pippin. 'Though you are  not far  wrong. I am still little 
line 37975=>more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people, and it will be four years 
line 37976=>yet  before I "come of age", as we say in the Shire: But do not bother about 
line 37977=>me. Come and look and tell me what I can see.' 
line 37978=>     The  sun was now  climbing, and the  mists in the  vale below  had been 
line 37979=>drawn up. The last of them  were  floating away, just  overhead, as wisps of 
line 37980=>white cloud borne  on  the  stiffening breeze from  the East,  that  was now 
line 37981=>flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the citadel. Away down 
line 37982=>in the valley-bottom, five leagues or  so as  the eye leaps, the Great River  
line 37983=>could now  be seen grey  and glittering, coming  out of the  north-west, and 
line 37984=>bending in a mighty sweep south and west again, till it was lost to  view in 
line 37985=>a haze and shimmer, far beyond which lay the Sea fifty leagues away. 
line 37986=>     Pippin could see all the  Pelennor laid out before him, dotted into the 
line 37987=>distance with farmsteads  and little  walls, barns  and  byres, but  nowhere 
line 37988=>could he see any kine  or other  beasts.  Many  roads and tracks crossed the 
line 37989=>green fields,  and there  was much coming and going: wains moving  in  lines 
line 37990=>towards the Great Gate, and  others passing  out.  Now and again  a horseman 
line 37991=>would ride up, and leap from  the saddle  and hasten into the City. But most  
line 37992=>of the traffic went out along the chief highway,  and that turned south, and 
line 37993=>then  bending  swifter than the River skirted the hills and passed soon from 
line 37994=>sight.  It was wide  and well-paved, and along its eastern  edge ran a broad 
line 37995=>green riding-track, and beyond that a wall . On the ride horsemen galloped to  
line 37996=>and  fro, but all the  street seemed to be  choked with great  covered wains 
line 37997=>going  south.  But  soon Pippin  saw that  all was in fact well-ordered: the 
line 37998=>wains were  moving in  three  lines,  one swifter  drawn  by horses; another  
line 37999=>slower, great waggons with fair housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and 
line 38000=>along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men. 
line 38001=>     'That is the  road  to the  vales of  Tumladen and  Lossarnach, and the 
line 38002=>mountain-villages,  and then on  to Lebennin,' said  Beregond. 'There  go the 
line 38003=>last  of  the  wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children, and the 
line 38004=>women that must go  with them.  They must all  be gone from the Gate and the 
line 38005=>
line 38006=>####-road  clear for a league  before  noon: tha t was the  order.  It  is  a  sad 
line 38007=>necessity.'  He sighed. 'Few, maybe, of those now sundered will meet  again.  
line 38008=>And there  were  always too few children  in  this  city; but now there  are 
line 38009=>none-save some young lads  that will not depart,  and may  find some task to 
line 38010=>do: my own son is one of them.' 
line 38011=>     They fell silent for a while. Pippin gazed anxiously eastward, as if at 
line 38012=>any moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields. 'What can 
line 38013=>I see there?' he asked, pointing down to the  middle of the great  curve  of 
line 38014=>the Anduin. 'Is that another city, or what is it?' 
line 38015=>     'It was  a city,'  said Beregond, 'the chief city of Gondor,  of  which 
line 38016=>this  was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of Osgiliath  on either side 
line 38017=>of Anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. Yet we won it back in 
line 38018=>the  days of  the youth  of Denethor: not to dwell in,  but  to  hold as  an 
line 38019=>outpost, and  to rebuild  the  bridge for the  passage of our arms. And then 
line 38020=>came the Fell Riders out of Minas Morgul.' 
line 38021=>     'The Black R iders?' said Pippin, opening his eyes,  and they  were wide 
line 38022=>and dark with an old fear re-awakened. 
line 38023=>     'Yes,  they  were  black,' said  Beregond,  'and  I  see  that you know 
line 38024=>something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.' 
line 38025=>     'I know of them,' said  Pippin softly,  'but I will not  speak of  them 
line 38026=>now, so near, so near.' He  broke  off  and lifted his eyes above the River, 
line 38027=>and  it  seemed to  him that  all  he could  see was  a vast and threatening 
line 38028=>shadow. Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged 
line 38029=>edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a  
line 38030=>cloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom. But  even as he looked 
line 38031=>it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly, 
line 38032=>slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun. 
line 38033=>     'So  near to Mordor?' said  Beregond quietly.  'Yes,  there it lies. We 
line 38034=>seldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow: sometimes it 
line 38035=>seems fainter and more distant;  sometimes nearer and darker. It  is growing 
line 38036=>and  darkening now; and  therefore  our fear  and disquiet grow too. And the 
line 38037=>Fell Riders, less  than a year ago they won back the crossings, and  many of 
line 38038=>our best men were  slain.  Boromir it  was that drove  the enemy at last back  
line 38039=>from this western shore, and we hold still the near half of Osgiliath. For a  
line 38040=>little  while. But  we  await  now  a new onslaught there.  Maybe the  chief 
line 38041=>onslaught of the war that comes.' 
line 38042=>     'When?' said Pippin. 'Have  you a  guess?  For I saw the  beacons  last 
line 38043=>
line 38044=>####-night and  the errand-riders; and  Gandalf said that it was a sign that  war 
line 38045=>had begun. He seemed in a desperate hurry. But now everything seems to  have 
line 38046=>slowed up again.' 
line 38047=>     'Only because  everything is now ready,' said Beregond. 'It  is but the 
line 38048=>deep breath before the plunge.' 
line 38049=>     'But why were the beacons lit last night?' 
line 38050=>     'It is  over-late  to  send  for aid  when you  are  already besieged,' 
line 38051=>answered Beregond. 'But I  do  not  know the  counsel of  the  Lord  and his 
line 38052=>captains. They have many ways of gathering news.  And  the Lord Denethor  is 
line 38053=>unlike  other men: he sees far. Some  say that as he sits alone in his  high 
line 38054=>chamber  in the Tower at night, and bends his thought  this way and that, he  
line 38055=>can read somewhat of the future; and that he  will  at times search even the 
line 38056=>mind of the  Enemy, wrestling  with  him. And so it  is that he is old, worn 
line 38057=>before his  time. But however that may be, my lord Faramir is abroad, beyond 
line 38058=>the River on some perilous errand, and he may have sent tidings.  
line 38059=>     'But if you would know what I think set  the beacons ablaze, it was the 
line 38060=>news  that came yestereve  out of Lebennin. There is a great  fleet  drawing 
line 38061=>near to the mouths of Anduin, manned by  the corsairs of Umbar in the South. 
line 38062=>They have long ceased to fear the might of Gondor, and they have allied them 
line 38063=>with the Enemy, and now  make  a heavy stroke in  his cause. For this attack  
line 38064=>will draw off much of the help  that  we looked  to  have  from Lebennin and  
line 38065=>Belfalas, where folk are hardy a nd numerous. All the more do our thoughts go 
line 38066=>north to Rohan; and the more glad are we for these tidings  of  victory that 
line 38067=>you bring. 
line 38068=>     'And yet'  - he paused and stood up, and looked round, north,  east, and 
line 38069=>south - 'the doings at Isengard  should warn us that we are  caught now in a  
line 38070=>great net and strategy. This is no longer a  bickering at the fords, raiding 
line 38071=>from Ithilien and from Anurien, ambushing and pillaging. This is a great war 
line 38072=>long-planned, and we are but one piece in it, whatever pride may say. Things 
line 38073=>move  in the  far  East beyond the  Inland Sea, it is reported; and north in 
line 38074=>Mirkwood and beyond; and south in Harad. And now all  realms shall be put to 
line 38075=>the test, to stand, or fall  - under the Shadow. 
line 38076=>     'Yet, Master Peregrin, we have this honour:  ever we bear  the brunt of 
line 38077=>the  chief  hatred  of the Dark Lord, for that hatred comes down out of  the 
line 38078=>depths of  time and over the deeps  of the Sea. Here will the  hammer -stroke 
line 38079=>fall hardest. And for that reason Mithrandir came  hither in such haste. For 
line 38080=>if we fall, who shall stand? And, Master  Peregrin, do you see any hope that 
line 38081=>
line 38082=>####-we shall stand?' 
line 38083=>     Pippin did not answer. He looked at the great walls, and the towers and 
line 38084=>brave banners, and  the sun in the high sky, and then at the gathering gloom 
line 38085=>in the East; and he thought of the long fingers of that Shadow: of  the orcs 
line 38086=>in  the woods and the mountains, the treason of Isengard,  the birds of evil 
line 38087=>eye, and the Black Riders even in the lanes of the Shire - and of the winged 
line 38088=>terror,  the Nazgyl. He  shuddered, and hope seemed  to wither. And even  at 
line 38089=>that moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscured, as though a dark 
line 38090=>wing had  passed across it. Almost beyond hearing he thought he caught, high 
line 38091=>and far up in the heavens, a cry: faint, but heart-quelling, cruel and cold. 
line 38092=>He blanched and cowered against the wall. 
line 38093=>     'What was that?' asked Beregond. 'You also felt something?' 
line 38094=>     'Yes,' muttered Pippin. 'It is the  sign of our fall, and the shadow of 
line 38095=>doom, a Fell Rider of the air.' 
line 38096=>     'Yes, the  shadow of doom,' said Beregond. 'I fear  that  Minas  Tirith 
line 38097=>shall fall. Night comes. The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.' 
line 38098=>     For a time they  sat together with bowed heads and did  not speak. Then 
line 38099=>suddenly Pippin looked up and  saw  that  the  sun was still shining and the 
line 38100=>banners still streaming in the breeze. He shook  himself. 'It is passed,' he 
line 38101=>said. 'No, my  heart will not yet despair. Gandalf fell and has returned and 
line 38102=>is with us. We may stand, if only on one leg, or at least be left still  upon 
line 38103=>our knees.' 
line 38104=>     'Rightly said!' cried Beregond, rising and striding to and  fro.  'Nay, 
line 38105=>though all things  must come  utterly to an  end  in  time, Gondor shall not 
line 38106=>perish yet. Not though  the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build 
line 38107=>a hill of carrion before them. There  are still other fastnesses, and secret 
line 38108=>ways of escape  into the mountains. Hope and memory shall live still in some 
line 38109=>hidden valley where the grass is green.' 
line 38110=>     'All the same, I  wish it was over for good or ill.' said Pippin. 'I am 
line 38111=>no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge 
line 38112=>of one  that  I  can't escape  is  worst  of all.  What a long  day it seems 
line 38113=>already! I should  be happier, if we  were not obliged  to stand and  watch, 
line 38114=>making  no move, striking nowhere first. No stroke would have been struck in 
line 38115=>Rohan, I think, but for Gandalf.' 
line 38116=>     'Ah, there  you  lay  your finger on  the  sore  that  many feel!' said 
line 38117=>Beregond. 'But things may change when Faramir returns. He is bold, more bold 
line 38118=>than many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can 
line 38119=>
line 38120=>####-be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man 
line 38121=>of hardihood  and swift  judgement in the field. But such is  Faramir.  Less 
line 38122=>reckless and eager than Boromir, but  not less resolute. Yet what indeed can 
line 38123=>he do? We cannot assault  the mountains of  -  of yonder  realm. Our reach is 
line 38124=>shortened, and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it. Then our hand  
line 38125=>must be heavy!' He smote the hilt of his sword. 
line 38126=>     Pippin looked at  him: tall and proud and noble, as all the men that he 
line 38127=>had yet seen in that land; and  with  a glitter in  his eye as he thought of 
line 38128=>the battle. 'Alas! my own hand feels as light as a feather,' he thought, but 
line 38129=>he  said nothing.  'A  pawn did  Gandalf  say?  Perhaps  but  on  the  wrong 
line 38130=>chessboard.' 
line 38131=>     So they  talked  until the  sun  reached  its height, and suddenly  the 
line 38132=>noon-bells were rung, and there was a  stir in the citadel; for all save the 
line 38133=>watchmen were going to their meal. 
line 38134=>     'Will you come with me?' said Beregond. 'You may join my  mess for this 
line 38135=>day. I do not know to  what  company  you will be  assigned; or the Lord may 
line 38136=>hold you at his own command. But you will be welcome. And it will be well to 
line 38137=>meet as many men as you may, while there is yet time.' 
line 38138=>     'I shall be glad  to come,' said Pippin. 'I am  lonely, to tell you the 
line 38139=>truth. I left my best friend behind in Rohan, and I have had  no one to talk  
line 38140=>to  or jest with. Perhaps  I could  really join your  company?  Are  you the  
line 38141=>captain? If so, you could take me on, or speak for me?' 
line 38142=>     'Nay, nay,' Beregond laughed, 'I am no captain. Neither office nor rank  
line 38143=>nor lordship  have I,  being but a plain man of arms of the Third Company of 
line 38144=>the Citadel. Yet, Master Peregrin, to be only a man of arms of the  Guard of 
line 38145=>the Tower of Gondor  is held worthy in the City, and such men have honour in 
line 38146=>the land.' 
line 38147=>     'Then it is far beyond me,' said Pippin. 'Take me back to our room, and 
line 38148=>if Gandalf is not there, I will go where you like  - as your guest. ' 
line 38149=>     Gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so  Pippin went  
line 38150=>with Beregond and was made known  to  the  men of the  Third Company. And 
line 38151=>it 
line 38152=>seemed that Beregond got as much honour from it as his guest, for Pippin was 
line 38153=>very welcome.  There  had  already  been  much talk  in  the  citadel  about 
line 38154=>Mithrandir's companion and his  long  closeting with the  Lord;  and  rumour 
line 38155=>declared that a Prince  of the Halflings had  come out of the North to offer  
line 38156=>allegiance to Gondor and five  thousand  swords.  And some said that when the 
line 38157=>
line 38158=>####-Riders came from Rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small 
line 38159=>maybe, but doughty. 
line 38160=>     Though Pippin had regretfully to destroy this  hopeful  tale,  he could 
line 38161=>not be rid of his new  rank, only fitting, men thought, to one befriended by 
line 38162=>Boromir and honoured by  the Lord Denethor; and they thanked him for  
line 38163=>coming 
line 38164=>among them, and  hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him 
line 38165=>as much food and ale as he could  wish. Indeed his  only  trouble was to  be 
line 38166=>'wary' according  to the counsel of Gandalf, and  not to let  his tongue wag 
line 38167=>freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends. 
line 38168=>     At length  Beregond  rose. 'Farewell for  this time!'  he said. 'I have 
line 38169=>duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, I think. But if you  are 
line 38170=>lonely, as you  say, maybe  you would like a  merry guide about the City. My 
line 38171=>son would go with you gladly. A good lad, I may say. If that pleases you, go 
line 38172=>down to  the  lowest  circle and ask for  the Old  Guesthouse  in  the  Rath 
line 38173=>Celerdain, the Lampwrights' Street. You will find him  there with other lads 
line 38174=>that are remaining in the City. There may be things worth seeing down at the 
line 38175=>Great Gate ere the closing.' 
line 38176=>     He went out, and soon after all the  others followed. The day was st ill 
line 38177=>fine, though  it  was  growing hazy,  and it was  hot for March, even so far 
line 38178=>southwards. Pippin felt sleepy,  but  the  lodging seemed cheerless, and  he 
line 38179=>decided to go down and  explore the City. He took a few morsels that he  had 
line 38180=>saved to Shadowfax,  and  they were  graciously accepted,  though the  horse 
line 38181=>seemed to have no lack. Then he walked on down many winding ways.  
line 38182=>     People  stared  much  as  he  passed. To  his  face  men  were  gravely 
line 38183=>courteous, saluting him after the manner of Gondor with bowed head and hands 
line 38184=>upon the breast; but  behind him he heard many calls,  as those out of doors 
line 38185=>cried to others within  to come  and see the Prince  of the  Halflings,  the 
line 38186=>companion of Mithrandir. Many used some other tongue than the Common 
line 38187=>Speech, 
line 38188=>but  it  was not long before he  learned at least what was meant by  Ernil i 
line 38189=>Pheriannath  and knew that his title had gone down before him into the City. 
line 38190=>     He came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to 
line 38191=>the lowest and widest circle, a nd there  he was directed to the Lampwrights' 
line 38192=>Street, a broad way running towards  the  Great Gate. In it he found the Old 
line 38193=>Guesthouse, a large building of grey weathered stone with  two wings running 
line 38194=>
line 38195=>####-back from the street, and between them a narrow greensward, behind which 
line 38196=>was 
line 38197=>the many-windowed house, fronted along its whole  width by  a pillared porch 
line 38198=>and  a flight of steps down on  to  the grass.  Boys were playing  among the 
line 38199=>pillars,  the only children  that Pippin had  seen  in Minas Tirith,  and he 
line 38200=>stopped to look at them. Presently one of them caught sight of him, and with 
line 38201=>a  shout  he sprang across  the grass and  came into the street, followed by 
line 38202=>several others. There he stood in front of Pippin, looking him up and down. 
line 38203=>     'Greetings!' said  the la d. 'Where do you come from? You are a stranger  
line 38204=>in the City.' 
line 38205=>     'I was,' said Pippin; 'but they say I have become a man of Gondor.' 
line 38206=>     'Oh  come!' said the lad. 'Then we are all men  here.  But how old  are 
line 38207=>you, and what is your name? I am ten  years a lready, and  shall soon be five 
line 38208=>feet.  I am  taller  than you. But then my father  is  a  Guard, one of  the 
line 38209=>tallest. What is your father?' 
line 38210=>     'Which question  shall  I  answer first?' said Pippin. 'My father farms 
line 38211=>the  lands  round Whitwell  near  Tuckborough in  the  Shire.  I  am  nearly 
line 38212=>twenty-nine, so I pass you there; though I am but four feet, and  not likely 
line 38213=>to grow any more, save sideways.' 
line 38214=>     'Twenty-nine!' said the lad  and whistled. 'Why, you are  quite old! As 
line 38215=>old as my  uncle Iorlas. Still,' he added hopefully, 'I  wager I could stand 
line 38216=>you on your head or lay you on your back.' 
line 38217=>     'Maybe you could, if I let you,' said Pippin with a laugh. 'And maybe I 
line 38218=>could  do  the  same  to  you: we know some  wrestling tricks in  my  little 
line 38219=>country.  Where,  let  me tell  you,  I am considered  uncommonly large  and 
line 38220=>strong; and I have never allowed anyone  to stand me  on  my  head. So if it 
line 38221=>came to a trial and nothing else would serve, I might have  to kill you. For  
line 38222=>when you  are older, you will learn that folk are not always what they seem;  
line 38223=>and though  you may have taken me for a soft stranger -lad and easy prey, let  
line 38224=>me  warn you: I am not,  I  am a halfling,  hard, bold,  and wicked!' Pippin 
line 38225=>pulled such  a  grim face  that the boy stepped  back a pace, but at once he 
line 38226=>returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye. 
line 38227=>     'No!'  Pippin laughed. 'Don't  believe what strangers say of themselves 
line 38228=>either! I am  not a fighter.  But it  would be politer in any  case for  the 
line 38229=>challenger to say who he is.' 
line 38230=>     The boy drew himself  up  proudly.  'I am Bergil son of Beregond of the 
line 38231=>Guards,' he said. 
line 38232=>
line 38233=>####-     'So I thought,' said Pippin, 'for you look like your father. I know him 
line 38234=>and he sent me to find you.' 
line 38235=>     'Then why did you not say so at once?' said Bergil, and suddenly a look  
line 38236=>of dismay came over his face. 'Do not  tell me that he has changed his mind,  
line 38237=>and will send me away with the maidens! But no, the last wains have gone.' 
line 38238=>     'His message is less bad than that, if not good.' said Pippin. 'He says 
line 38239=>that if you would  prefer it to standing me  on  my head, you might show  me 
line 38240=>round the  City for  a while  and cheer my loneliness. I can  tell  you some 
line 38241=>tales of far countries in return.' 
line 38242=>     Bergil  clapped his hands,  and laughed with relief.  'All is well,' he 
line 38243=>cried. 'Come then! We were  soon going to the  Gate  to look  on. We will go 
line 38244=>now.' 
line 38245=>     'What is happening there?' 
line 38246=>     'The  Captains  of the  Outlands  are  expected up the South  Road  ere 
line 38247=>sundown. Come with us and you will see.' 
line 38248=>     Bergil proved a good comrade, the best company Pippin had had  since he 
line 38249=>parted from Merry, and soon they  were laughing and  talking  gaily  as they 
line 38250=>went about  the streets, heedless of the many  glances  that men gave  them. 
line 38251=>Before long they found themselves in  a throng going towards the Great Gate. 
line 38252=>There Pippin went  up  much in  the esteem of Bergil,  for when he spoke his 
line 38253=>name and the pass-word the guard saluted  him and let  him pass through; and 
line 38254=>what was more, he allowed him to take his companion with him. 
line 38255=>     'That is good!' said Bergil. 'We boys are no longer allowed to pass the 
line 38256=>Gate without an elder. Now we shall see better.' 
line 38257=>     Beyond the Gate there was a crowd of men  along  the  verge of the road 
line 38258=>and of the great paved space into  which all the wa ys to  Minas Tirith  ran. 
line 38259=>All eyes were turned southwards, and soon a murmur rose: 'There is dust away 
line 38260=>there! They are coming!' 
line 38261=>     Pippin and Bergil  edged their way  forward to the front of the  crowd, 
line 38262=>and waited. Horns sounded at some distance, and the noise of cheering rolled 
line 38263=>towards them like a gathering wind. Then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and 
line 38264=>all about them people were shouting. 
line 38265=>     'Forlong! Forlong!' Pippin  heard men calling.  'What do  they say?' he 
line 38266=>asked. 
line 38267=>     'Forlong  has come,' Bergil answered; 'old Forlong the Fat, the Lord of 
line 38268=>Lossarnach. That is where  my grandsire  lives. Hurrah! Here he is. Good old 
line 38269=>Forlong!' 
line 38270=>
line 38271=>####-     Leading the line there came walking a big thick -limbed horse, and on it 
line 38272=>sat a man of  wide  shoulders and  huge girth, but old and grey-bearded, yet 
line 38273=>mail-clad and  black-helmed and  bearing  a  long heavy  spear.  Behind  him 
line 38274=>marched  proudly  a  dusty  line  of  men,   well-armed  and  bearing  great 
line 38275=>battle-axes; grim-faced they were, and shorter  and  somewhat swarthier  than 
line 38276=>any men that Pippin had yet seen in Gondor. 
line 38277=>     'Forlong!' men shouted.  'True heart, true friend!  Forlong!'  But when 
line 38278=>the men of Lossarnach  had passed they muttered: 'So few! Two hundreds, 
line 38279=>what 
line 38280=>are they? We hoped for ten times the number. That will be the new tidings of 
line 38281=>the  black fleet.  They  are sparing only a tithe  of  their strength. Still 
line 38282=>every little is a gain.' 
line 38283=>     And  so  the  companies  came and  were hailed and  cheered  and passed 
line 38284=>through  the Gate, men of the Outlands marching to defend the City of Gondor  
line 38285=>in a dark hour; but always too few, always less than hope looked for or need 
line 38286=>asked. The  men of  Ringlu  Vale  behind the  son  of  their  lord, Dervorin 
line 38287=>striding  on foot: three hundreds. From  the uplands of  Morthond, the great 
line 38288=>Blackroot Vale,  tall Duinhir with  his sons, Duilin and  Derufin,  and five 
line 38289=>hundred bowmen. From the  Anfalas, the Langstrand far away,  a  long line of 
line 38290=>men of many sorts, hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages, scantily 
line 38291=>equipped  save for the hou sehold of Golasgil their lord. From Lamedon, a few 
line 38292=>grim hillmen without a  captain.  Fisher -folk of the Ethir, some hundred  or  
line 38293=>more spared from the ships. Hirluin the Fair of the Green Hills from Pinnath 
line 38294=>Gelin with three hundreds  of gallant green-clad men. And last and proudest,  
line 38295=>Imrahil,  Prince  of Dol Amroth,  kinsman of the  Lord, with  gilded banners 
line 38296=>bearing his token of the Ship and  the Silver Swan, and a company of knights 
line 38297=>in full harness riding grey horses; and behind them seven hundreds of men at 
line 38298=>arms, tall as lords, grey-eyed, dark-haired, singing as they came. 
line 38299=>     And  that was  all, less than  three thousands full told. No more would 
line 38300=>come. Their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into  the City and died 
line 38301=>away. The onlookers stood silent for a while. Dust hung  in the air, for the 
line 38302=>wind had  died and  the  evening  was heavy. Already  the  closing  hour was 
line 38303=>drawing nigh, and the red sun had gone behind  Mindolluin. Shadow  came 
line 38304=>down 
line 38305=>on the City. 
line 38306=>     Pippin  looked  up,  and  it  seemed to  him that  the  sky  had  grown 
line 38307=>ashen-grey, as  if a vast dust  and  smoke hung above  them, and  light came 
line 38308=>
line 38309=>####-dully  through it. But in the West  the dying  sun had  set all  the fume on 
line 38310=>fire, and now Mindolluin stood black against a burning smoulder flecked  with 
line 38311=>embers. 'So ends a  fair day in wrath!' he said forgetful of the lad  at his 
line 38312=>side. 
line 38313=>     'So it  will, if  I  have not returned before the sundown-bells,'  said 
line 38314=>Bergil. 'Come! There goes the trumpet for the closing of the Gate.' 
line 38315=>     Hand  in hand they went  back into the City, the last to  pass the Gate 
line 38316=>before it  was  shut;  and as they  reached the Lampwrights'  Street all the 
line 38317=>bells in the towers tolled solemnly. Lights sprang in many windows, and from 
line 38318=>the houses and wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound 
line 38319=>of song. 
line 38320=>     'Farewell  for  this  time,'  said  Bergil.  'Take  my  greetings to my 
line 38321=>:father, and thank him for the company that he sent. Come again soon, I beg.  
line 38322=>Almost  I wish now that there was no war,  for we might have  had some merry 
line 38323=>times. We might have journeyed to Lossarnach, to my grandsire's house; it is 
line 38324=>good to be  there in Spring, the  woods and fields are  full of flowers. But 
line 38325=>maybe we will go thither together  yet.  They will never overcome our  Lord, 
line 38326=>and my father is very valiant. Farewell and return!' 
line 38327=>     They  parted and Pippin hurried back towards the citadel.  It seemed  a  
line 38328=>long way, and he  grew hot and  very hungry; and night closed down swift and 
line 38329=>dark.  Not a star pricked the sky. He  was late for the daymeal in the mess, 
line 38330=>and Beregond greeted him gladly, and sat him at his side to hear news of his 
line 38331=>son.  After the  meal Pippin stayed a while,  and then took his leave, for a  
line 38332=>strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see Gandalf 
line 38333=>again. 
line 38334=>     'Can you find your way?' said Beregond at  the door of the  small hall, 
line 38335=>on the north side of the citadel, where  they had sat. 'It is a black night, 
line 38336=>and all the blacker  since  orders came that lights are  to be dimmed within 
line 38337=>the City, and none are to shine out from  the walls. And I can give you news 
line 38338=>of another order: you will be summoned to the Lord Denethor  early tomorrow.  
line 38339=>I  fear you will not  be for the Third  Company. Still we may  hope  to meet 
line 38340=>again. Farewell and sleep in peace!' 
line 38341=>     The lodging was   dark,  save  for a  little lantern  set  on the table. 
line 38342=>Gandalf was  not there.  Gloom settled  still  more  heavily  on Pippin.  He 
line 38343=>climbed on the bench  and tried  to  peer out of a window,  but it was  like 
line 38344=>looking  into a pool of ink. He  got down and closed the shutter and went to 
line 38345=>bed.  For a  while he lay and listened for  sounds  of Gandalf's return, and 
line 38346=>
line 38347=>####-then he fell into an uneasy sleep. 
line 38348=>     In  the  night he was wakened by  a light, and he saw that  Gandalf had 
line 38349=>come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. 
line 38350=>There were candles on the  table and rolls of parchment. He heard the wizard 
line 38351=>sigh, and mutter: 'When will Faramir return?' 
line 38352=>     'Hullo!' said Pippin, poking his head round the curtain. 'I thought you  
line 38353=>had forgotten  all about me. I am  glad  to see you back. It has been a long 
line 38354=>day.' 
line 38355=>     'But the night  will be too  short,' said  Gandalf.  'I have  come back  
line 38356=>here, for I  must have a  little peace,  alone. You should sleep,  in  a bed 
line 38357=>while you still  may. At the sunrise I  shall take you to the  Lord Denethor  
line 38358=>again. No, when the  summons  comes, not at sunrise. The Darkness has begun. 
line 38359=>There will be no dawn.' 
line 38360=> 
line 38361=>
line 38362=>####- 
line 38363=>
line 38364=>Chapter 2. The Passing of the Grey Company 
line 38365=>
line 38366=> 
line 38367=> 
line 38368=>     Gandalf was gone, and the thudding  hoofs of Shadowfax were lost in the  
line 38369=>night, when Merry came  back to Aragorn. He  had only a light bundle, for he 
line 38370=>had lost his pack at Parth  Galen, and all he had was a few useful things he 
line 38371=>had picked up among the wreckage of  Isengard. Hasufel was  already saddled. 
line 38372=>Legolas and Gimli with their horse stood close by. 
line 38373=>     'So four of the Company still remain,'  said Aragorn. 'We  will ride on 
line 38374=>together.  But  we  shall  not  go alone,  as  I  thought. The  king is  now 
line 38375=>determined  to set out at  once.  Since the coming of the winged  shadow, he 
line 38376=>desires to return to the hills under cover of night.' 
line 38377=>     'And then whither?' said Legolas.  
line 38378=>     'I cannot say yet,' Aragorn answered. 'As for the king, he will  go  to 
line 38379=>the muster that he commanded at Edoras,  four  nights from now. And there, I 
line 38380=>think, he will hear tidings of war, and the Riders of Rohan  will go down to 
line 38381=>Minas Tirith. But for myself, and any that will go with me . . .' 
line 38382=>     'I for one!' cried Legolas. 'And Gimli with him!' said the Dwarf. 
line 38383=>     'Well, for myself,' said Aragorn, 'it is dark before me. I must go down 
line 38384=>also to Minas Tirith, but I  do not yet see the  road. An hour long prepared 
line 38385=>approaches.' 
line 38386=>     'Don't leave me behind!'  said Merry. 'I have not been of much use yet; 
line 38387=>but I don't want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is 
line 38388=>over. I don't think the Riders will want to be bothered with me now. Though, 
line 38389=>of  course, the  king did say that I was to sit by  him when  he came to his 
line 38390=>house and tell him all about the Shire.' 
line 38391=>     'Yes,' said Aragorn, 'and your road lies with him, I  think, Merry. But 
line 38392=>do  not  look for mirth at  the ending. It will be long, I fear, ere Thjoden 
line 38393=>sits  at ease  again  in  Meduseld.  Many hopes will wither  in this  bitter  
line 38394=>Spring.' 
line 38395=>     Soon all were ready  to depart:  twenty -four horses, with Gimli  behind 
line 38396=>Legolas,  and Merry  in front of Aragorn. Presently they were riding swiftly  
line 38397=>through the night. They had not long passed the mounds at the Fords of Isen, 
line 38398=>when a Rider galloped up from the rear of their line. 
line 38399=>     'My  lord,'  he said to  the king, 'there are horsemen behind us. As we 
line 38400=>crossed the fords I thought that  I heard them. Now we  are sure.  They  are 
line 38401=>
line 38402=>####-overtaking us, riding hard.' 
line 38403=>     Thjoden at once called a halt. The Riders turned about and seized their 
line 38404=>spears.  Aragorn  dismounted and  set Merry on the  ground, and drawing  his 
line 38405=>sword he stood by the king's stirrup. Jomer and his esquire rode back to the 
line 38406=>rear. Merry felt more  like unneeded baggage than  ever, and he wondered, if 
line 38407=>there was a fight, what  he should do. Supposing the king's small escort was 
line 38408=>trapped and overcome, but  he escaped into the darkness  - alone in the wild  
line 38409=>fields of Rohan  with no idea of where he was in all the  endless miles? 'No 
line 38410=>good!' he thought. He drew his sword and tightened his belt. 
line 38411=>     The sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but suddenly it 
line 38412=>rode  out clear  again. Then they all  heard the sound of  hoofs, and at the 
line 38413=>same moment they saw dark shapes coming  swiftly on the path from the fords.  
line 38414=>The moonlight glinted here and  there  on the points of spears. The number of 
line 38415=>the pursuers could  not be told, but they seemed  no fewer than  the  king's 
line 38416=>escort, at the least. 
line 38417=>     When they were some  fifty paces off,  Jomer  cried  in  a  loud voice: 
line 38418=>'Halt! Halt! Who rides in Rohan?' 
line 38419=>     The  pursuers  brought  their  steeds  to  a sudden  stand.  A  silence 
line 38420=>followed: and  then in the  moonlight, a  horseman could be seen dismounting 
line 38421=>and walking  slowly  forward. His hand  showed white as  he held it up, palm 
line 38422=>outward, in token of pea ce; but the king's men gripped their weapons. At ten 
line 38423=>paces the man stopped. He was  tall,  a dark standing shadow. Then his clear 
line 38424=>voice rang out. 
line 38425=>     'Rohan? Rohan did you say?  That is  a glad word.  We seek that land in 
line 38426=>haste from long afar.' 
line 38427=>     'You have found it,' said Jomer. 'When you crossed the fords yonder you  
line 38428=>entered it. But it is the realm of Thjoden  the King. None ride here save by 
line 38429=>his leave. Who are you? And what is your haste?' 
line 38430=>     'Halbarad D®nadan, Ranger  of the North I am,' cried the man. 'We  seek  
line 38431=>one Aragorn son of Arathorn, and we heard that he was in Rohan.' 
line 38432=>     'And  you have  found  him also!' cried  Aragorn. Giving his  reins  to 
line 38433=>Merry, he ran  forward and embraced  the newcomer. 'Halbarad!' he said.  'Of 
line 38434=>all joys this is the least expected!' 
line 38435=>     Merry breathed a sigh of relief. He had thought that this was some last 
line 38436=>trick of Saruman's, to waylay  the king  while he  had  only a few men about 
line 38437=>him;  but it seemed that there would be no need to die in Thjoden's defence,  
line 38438=>not yet at any rate. He sheathed his sword. 
line 38439=>
line 38440=>####-     'All is well,' said Aragorn, turning back. 'Here are some of my own kin 
line 38441=>from  the far land where I dwelt. But why they come, and how many  they  be, 
line 38442=>Halbarad shall tell us.' 
line 38443=>     'I  have thirty  with me,' said Halbarad. 'That is  all  of our kindred 
line 38444=>that could be gathered in  haste; but the  brethren Elladan and Elrohir have 
line 38445=>ridden with us, desiring to go to  the  war. We rode as swiftly as we  might 
line 38446=>when your summons came.' 
line 38447=>     'But  I  did  not summon you,' said Aragorn,  'save  only  in wish.  My 
line 38448=>thoughts have often turned to you, and seldom more than tonight; yet I  have 
line 38449=>sent  no  word. But come! All such matters must wait. You find us riding  in 
line 38450=>haste and danger. Ride with us now, if the king will give his leave. ' 
line 38451=>     Thjoden was indeed glad of the news. 'It  is well!' he said.  'If these 
line 38452=>kinsmen be in any way like to yourself, my lord Aragorn, thirty such knights 
line 38453=>will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.' 
line 38454=>     Then the Riders  set out again, and Aragor n  for a while rode with  the 
line 38455=>D®nedain; and when they had spoken of tidings in the North and in the South, 
line 38456=>Elrohir said to him: 
line 38457=>     'I bring word to you from my father: The days are short. If thou art in  
line 38458=>haste, remember the Paths of the Dead. ' 
line 38459=>     'Always my days  have seemed  to me  too short to  achieve  my desire,' 
line 38460=>answered Aragorn. 'But great indeed will be my haste ere I take that road.' 
line 38461=>     'That  will soon  be seen,' said Elrohir. 'But let us speak  no more of 
line 38462=>these things upon the open road!' 
line 38463=>     And  Aragorn said to Halbarad: 'What is  that that  you bear, kinsman?' 
line 38464=>For  he  saw that instead  of a  spear he bore a  tall  staff, as it were  a  
line 38465=>standard, but it was close-furled  in a black cloth  bound about  with  many 
line 38466=>thongs. 
line 38467=>     'It is a gift that  I bring  you  from the Lady of Rivendell,' answered 
line 38468=>Halbarad.  'She wrought it in secret,  and long was the making. But she also 
line 38469=>sends word  to you: The days now are short.  Either our hope cometh, or  all  
line 38470=>hopes end. Therefore I  send  thee what I have  made  for  thee. Fare  well, 
line 38471=>Elfstone!' 
line 38472=>     And Aragorn said:  'Now I  know  what you bear. Bear it still for  me a  
line 38473=>while!' And  he turned and  looked away to the North under  the great stars,  
line 38474=>and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night's journey lasted. 
line 38475=>     The night  was old  and the East grey  when  they rode  up at last from 
line 38476=>Deeping-coomb and came back to the Hornburg. There they were to lie and rest  
line 38477=>
line 38478=>####-for a brief while and take counsel. 
line 38479=>     Merry  slept  until  he was  roused by Legolas and  Gimli.  'The Sun is 
line 38480=>high,'  said Legolas. 'All others are  up and doing.  Come, Master Sluggard, 
line 38481=>and look at this place while you may!' 
line 38482=>     'There  was a  battle here  three  nights ago,' said Gimli,  'and  here 
line 38483=>Legolas and  I  played a game that I won only  by a single orc. Come and see 
line 38484=>how it was!  And there  are caves, Merry, caves of  wonder!  Shall we  visit 
line 38485=>them, Legolas, do you think?' 
line 38486=>     'Nay!  There is no  time,' said the Elf. 'Do  not spoil the wonder with 
line 38487=>haste! I have given you my wor d to return hither with you, if a day of peace 
line 38488=>and  freedom comes  again. But it is now near to noon, and  at that hour  we 
line 38489=>eat, and then set out again, I hear.' 
line 38490=>     Merry  got up  and yawned. His few hours'  sleep  had not  been  nearly 
line 38491=>enough; he was  t ired and rather dismal. He missed Pippin,  and felt that he 
line 38492=>was only a burden, while everybody was making plans for  speed in a business 
line 38493=>that he did not fully understand. 'Where is Aragorn?' he asked. 
line 38494=>     'In a  high chamber of the Burg,' said  Legolas. 'He has neither rested 
line 38495=>nor slept, I think. He went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take 
line 38496=>thought, and only his kinsman, Halbarad, went with him;  but some dark doubt 
line 38497=>or care sits on him.' 
line 38498=>     'They are a strange company, these  newcomers,'  said Gimli. 'Stout men 
line 38499=>and lordly  they are,  and the  Riders  of Rohan look  almost as boys beside 
line 38500=>them; for they are grim men  of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most  
line 38501=>part, even as Aragorn himself; and they are silent.' 
line 38502=>     'But even as Aragorn they  are courteous, if they break  their silence.' 
line 38503=>said  Legolas. 'And have  you marked  the brethren Elladan and Elrohir? Less 
line 38504=>sombre is their  gear than  the  others', and  they are fair and  gallant as 
line 38505=>Elven-lords;  and that  is not  to be wondered  at in the sons of  Elrond of 
line 38506=>Rivendell.' 
line 38507=>     'Why have  they come? Have you heard?' asked Merry. He had now dressed, 
line 38508=>and he flung  his grey cloak about his shoulders; and  the  three passed out 
line 38509=>together towards the ruined gate of the Burg. 
line 38510=>     'They answered  a  summons,  as you  heard,'  said Gimli. 'Word  came to 
line 38511=>Rivendell, they  say: Aragorn has need of his kindred. Let the D®nedain ride 
line 38512=>to him in Rohan! But whence this message came they are now in doubt. 
line 38513=>Gandalf 
line 38514=>sent it, I would guess.' 
line 38515=>
line 38516=>####-     'Nay, Galadriel,' said  Legolas. 'Did she not speak  through Gandalf of 
line 38517=>the ride of the Grey Company from the North?' 
line 38518=>     'Yes,  you have it,' said Gimli. 'The Lady of  the Wood! She  read many 
line 38519=>hearts and  desires. Now why did  not we wish for some  of our own kinsfolk, 
line 38520=>Legolas?' 
line 38521=>     Legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away north and 
line 38522=>east, and his fair face was troubled. 'I do not  think that any would come,' 
line 38523=>he answered. 'They have no need to ride to war; war already marches on their 
line 38524=>own lands.' 
line 38525=>     For  a while the three companions walked together, speaking of this and 
line 38526=>that turn of the battle, and they went down from the broken gate, and passed 
line 38527=>the mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road, until they stood  
line 38528=>on  Helm's  Dike  and  looked into the Coomb. The Death Down  already  stood 
line 38529=>there, black and  tall and stony, and the great trampling and scoring of the 
line 38530=>grass by the Huorns could be  plainly  seen. The Dunlendings and many men of 
line 38531=>the garrison of the Burg were at work on the Dike or in the fields and about 
line 38532=>the battered walls behind;  yet all seemed  strangely  quiet: a weary valley 
line 38533=>resting after a  great storm. Soon they turned  back and went  to the midday 
line 38534=>meal in the hall of the Burg. 
line 38535=>     The  king was already there, and as soon as they  entered he called for  
line 38536=>Merry and  had a seat set for him at his side. 'It is not  as I  would  have 
line 38537=>it,' said Thjoden; 'for this is little like  my  fair  house  in Edoras. And 
line 38538=>your friend is gone, who should also be here. But it may be long ere we si t, 
line 38539=>you and I, at the high table in Meduseld; there will be no time for feasting 
line 38540=>when  I return  thither. But  come  now!  Eat and drink,  and  let us  speak 
line 38541=>together while we may. And then you shall ride with me.' 
line 38542=>     'May I?' said Merry, surprised and delighted.  'That would be splendid!' 
line 38543=>He had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words. 'I am afraid I am 
line 38544=>only in everybody's way,' he stammered; 'but  I should like to do anything I 
line 38545=>could, you know.' 
line 38546=>     'I doubt  it not,' said the king.  'I have had  a  good  hill -pony made 
line 38547=>ready for you. He will  bear you as swift as any horse by the  roads that we 
line 38548=>shall  take. For I will ride  from the  Burg  by mountain paths, not  by the 
line 38549=>plain, and so come to Edoras by way of Dunharrow where the Lady Jowyn 
line 38550=>awaits 
line 38551=>me. You shall  be  my esquire,  if you  will.  Is  there gear of war in this 
line 38552=>place, Jomer, that my sword-thain could use?' 
line 38553=>
line 38554=>####-     'There are no great weapon -hoards here, lord.' answered Jomer. 'Maybe a  
line 38555=>light helm might be found to fit him; but  we have no   mail or sword for one 
line 38556=>of his stature.' 
line 38557=>     'I have a sword,' said Merry, climbing from his  seat, and drawing from 
line 38558=>its black sheath his small bright blade. Filled suddenly with love  for this 
line 38559=>old man, he knelt on one knee,  and took  his hand and kissed it. 'May I lay 
line 38560=>the  sword  of  Meriadoc of the Shire on your lap Thjoden  King?' he  cried. 
line 38561=>'Receive my service, if you will!' 
line 38562=>     'Gladly will I take it,' said the king; and laying his  long old  hands 
line 38563=>upon  the brown hair  of the hobbit;  he blessed  him. 'Rise  now, Meriadoc, 
line 38564=>esquire  of Rohan of the household of  Meduseld!' he said.  'Take your sword 
line 38565=>and bear it unto good fortune!' 
line 38566=>     'As a father you shall be to me,' said Merry. 
line 38567=>     'For a little while,' said Thjoden. 
line 38568=>     They talked then together as they ate, until presently Jomer spoke. 'It 
line 38569=>is near the hour that we set for our going, lord,' he said. 'Shall I bid men 
line 38570=>sound the horns? But where is  Aragorn?  His place is empty and  he  has not 
line 38571=>eaten.' 
line 38572=>     'We  will make ready to ride,'  said Thjoden; 'but let  word be sent to 
line 38573=>the Lord Aragorn that the hour is nigh.' 
line 38574=>     The king with his guard and Merry at his side passed down from the gate 
line 38575=>of  the Burg to  where the Riders were assembling  on  the green.  Many were 
line 38576=>already mounted. It would be a   great company; for the king was leaving only 
line 38577=>a small garrison in the Burg, and all who could be spared were riding to the 
line 38578=>weapontake at  Edoras. A  thousand spears  had indeed already ridden away at 
line 38579=>night; but still there would be some five hundred more  to go  with the king, 
line 38580=>for the most part men from the fields and dales of Westfold. 
line 38581=>     A little  apart  the Rangers sat, silent,  in an ordered company, armed 
line 38582=>with  spear and bow  and sword. They were  clad in  cloaks of dark grey, and 
line 38583=>their hoods were ca st now over helm  and head. Their  horses were strong and 
line 38584=>of  proud  bearing, but rough-haired; and  one stood there without  a rider, 
line 38585=>Aragorn's own horse that they  had  brought from the North; Roheryn  was his 
line 38586=>name. There was no gleam  of stone  or gold, nor any fair thing in all their 
line 38587=>gear and harness: nor did their  riders bear any badge  or  token, save only 
line 38588=>that each  cloak was  pinned  upon the  left shoulder by a brooch of  silver  
line 38589=>shaped like a rayed star. 
line 38590=>     The  king mounted his horse, Snowmane,  and Merry sat beside him on his 
line 38591=>
line 38592=>####-pony: Stybba was his name. Presently Jomer came out from the gate, and  with 
line 38593=>him was Aragorn, and Halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, 
line 38594=>and two tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the  sons of 
line 38595=>Elrond,  that few could tell  them apart: dark-haired,  grey-eyed, and their 
line 38596=>faces elven-fair,  clad  alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver -grey. 
line 38597=>Behind them walked Legolas and  Gimli. But Merry had eyes only for  
line 38598=>Aragorn, 
line 38599=>so startling  wa s the  change that he saw  in  him, as if in one  night many 
line 38600=>years had fallen on his head. Grim was his face, grey-hued and weary. 
line 38601=>     'I  am troubled in mind, lord,'  he said, standing by the king's horse. 
line 38602=>'I have  heard strange words,  and I see new per ils far off. I have laboured 
line 38603=>long  in thought, and  now  I fear that I must change my  purpose. Tell  me, 
line 38604=>Thjoden, you ride now to Dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?' 
line 38605=>     'It is now a full hour past noon,' said Jomer. 'Before the night of the 
line 38606=>third day  from  now we should  come to the Hold. The Moon will then be  one 
line 38607=>night past his full, and the muster that the king commanded will be held the 
line 38608=>day after. More  speed we cannot make, if  the strength of  Rohan  is to  be 
line 38609=>gathered.' 
line 38610=>     Aragorn  was  silent for a moment. 'Three days,' he murmured, 'and  the 
line 38611=>muster  of Rohan will  only  be begun. But  I  see  that  it  cannot now  be 
line 38612=>hastened.'  He looked up, and it seemed that  he had made some decision; his 
line 38613=>face  was less troubled. Then, by  our leave, lord, I must take new  counsel 
line 38614=>for myself  and my  kindred. We must  ride  our  own road, and  no longer in  
line 38615=>secret. For me  the time of stealth  has  passed.  I  will ride east by  the 
line 38616=>swiftest way, and I will take the Paths of the Dead.' 
line 38617=>     'The Paths of the Dead!' said Thjoden, and trembled. 'Why do  you speak 
line 38618=>of them?' Jomer turned and gazed at Aragorn, and it seemed to Merry that the 
line 38619=>faces of  the Riders  that sat within  hearing turned pale at the words. 'If 
line 38620=>there be in  truth  such paths, ' said Thjoden, 'their gate  is in Dunharrow;  
line 38621=>but no living man may pass it.' 
line 38622=>     'Alas! Aragorn my friend!' said Jomer. 'I had hoped that we should ride 
line 38623=>to war together; but if you seek the  Paths of the Dead, then our parting is 
line 38624=>come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the Sun.' 
line 38625=>     'That road  I will take, nonetheless,' said Aragorn. 'But I say to you, 
line 38626=>Jomer, that in battle  we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of Mordor  
line 38627=>should stand between.' 
line 38628=>     'You will do as you wi ll, my lord Aragorn,' said Thjoden.  'It  is your 
line 38629=>
line 38630=>####-doom, maybe,  to  tread  strange paths that  others  dare not.  This parting 
line 38631=>grieves  me, and  my strength  is  lessened by it; but now  I must take  the 
line 38632=>mountain-roads and delay no longer. Farewell!' 
line 38633=>     'Farewell,  lord!' said  Aragorn.  'Ride unto great  renown!  Farewell, 
line 38634=>Merry! I leave you in  good hands,  better  than we hoped when we hunted the 
line 38635=>orcs to Fangorn. Legolas and Gimli  will still hunt with me,  I hope; but we 
line 38636=>shall not forget you.' 
line 38637=>     'Good-bye!'  said  Merry.  He could find no more to say.  He  felt very 
line 38638=>small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. More than 
line 38639=>ever he  missed the  unquenchable cheerfulness  of Pippin.  The  Riders were 
line 38640=>ready, and their horses were fidgeting;  he wished they would start arid get 
line 38641=>it over. 
line 38642=>     Now Thjoden  spoke to Jomer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud,  
line 38643=>and  with that word the Riders set forth. They  rode over the Dike  and down 
line 38644=>the  Coomb,  and  then,  turning swiftly  eastwards, they  took  a path that 
line 38645=>skirted  the foothills for a  mile or so, until bending south it passed back  
line 38646=>among the hills  and disappeared from view.  Aragorn  rode  to  the Dike and 
line 38647=>watched till  the king's men  were far down  the  Coomb.  Then he turned  to 
line 38648=>Halbarad. 
line 38649=>     'There go three that I love, and the  smallest not the least,' he said. 
line 38650=>'He knows not to what end he rides; yet if he knew, he still would go on.' 
line 38651=>     'A  little  people,  but  of  great worth  are  the  Shire-folk,'  said 
line 38652=>Halbarad.  'Little do they  know of  our long  labour  for the safekeeping of 
line 38653=>their borders, and yet I grudge it not.' 
line 38654=>     'And now our fates are  woven together,' said Aragorn. 'And yet,  alas!  
line 38655=>here we must  part. Well, I must eat a little, and  then we also must hast en 
line 38656=>away. Come, Legolas and Gimli! I must speak with you as I eat.' 
line 38657=>     Together they went back into  the  Burg; yet for some  time Aragorn sat 
line 38658=>silent at  the  table in the  hall, and the others waited  for him to speak. 
line 38659=>'Come!'  said  Legolas  at last. 'Speak and be  comforted, and shake off the 
line 38660=>shadow! What has happened since we came  back to this grim place in the grey 
line 38661=>morning?' 
line 38662=>     'A  struggle  somewhat grimmer  for  my  part than  the  battle of  the 
line 38663=>Hornburg,' answered  Aragorn. 'I have  looked  in  the Stone of  Orthanc,  my  
line 38664=>friends.' 
line 38665=>     'You have  looked in that accursed stone of  wizardry!' exclaimed Gimli 
line 38666=>with  fear  and astonishment in his face. 'Did  you say aught to  - him? Even 
line 38667=>
line 38668=>####-Gandalf feared that encounter.' 
line 38669=>     'You  forget  to whom  you speak,' said  Aragorn sternly, and his  eyes 
line 38670=>glinted. 'Did I not openly proclaim  my  title before  the doors  of Edoras?  
line 38671=>What do you fear that I should say to him? Nay, Gimli,' he said  in a softer  
line 38672=>voice,  and  the grimness left  his face, and  he looked   like  one who  has 
line 38673=>laboured  in sleepless pain for many nights.  'Nay, my  friends,  I  and the 
line 38674=>lawful master of the Stone, and I had both the right and the strength to use 
line 38675=>it, or so I judged. The right cannot be doubted.  The strength was  enough  - 
line 38676=>barely . ' 
line 38677=>     He drew a deep breath. 'It was  a bitter struggle, and the weariness is 
line 38678=>slow to pass. I spoke no word to him, and in the end I wrenched the Stone to 
line 38679=>my own  will. That alone he will find hard to endure. And he beheld me. Yes,  
line 38680=>Master Gimli, he saw me, but in other guise than you  see  me here. If  that 
line 38681=>will aid him, then I  have  done ill. But I do not think so. To  know that I 
line 38682=>lived  and walked the earth was a blow  to his heart, I deem; for he knew it 
line 38683=>not till now. The eyes in Orthanc did not see through the armour of Thjoden;  
line 38684=>but Sauron has not  forgotten Isildur and the  sword of  Elendil. Now in the 
line 38685=>very  hour  of  his  great  designs the  heir of  Isildur and the  Sword are 
line 38686=>revealed; for l showed the blade re-forged  to him. He is not so mighty   yet 
line 38687=>that he is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.' 
line 38688=>     'But he wields  great dominion, nonetheless,' said Gimli;  'and now  he 
line 38689=>will strike more swiftly.' 
line 38690=>     'The hasty  stroke  goes oft astray,' said Aragorn. 'We must press  our 
line 38691=>Enemy, and no longer wait upon him  for the move. See my friends, when I had 
line 38692=>mastered  the  Stone,  I  learned many things.  A grave peril I  saw  coming 
line 38693=>unlooked-for upon Gondor  from the  South that will  draw off great strength 
line 38694=>from the defence of Minas Tirith. If  it  is not countered  swiftly,  I deem 
line 38695=>that the City will be lost ere ten days be gone.' 
line 38696=>     'Then lost it must be,'  said Gimli. 'For  what  help is  there to send 
line 38697=>thither, and how could it come there in time?' 
line 38698=>     'I have  no help  to send,  therefore I must  go myself,'  said Aragorn. 
line 38699=>'But there is only one way through the mountains  that will  bring me to the 
line 38700=>coastlands before all is lost. That is the Paths of the Dead.' 
line 38701=>     'The Paths of the Dead!' said Gimli.  'It is a fell name; and little to 
line 38702=>the liking to the Men of Rohan, as I saw. Can the living use such a road and  
line 38703=>not perish? And even if you pass that way, what will so few avail to counter  
line 38704=>the strokes of Mordor?' 
line 38705=>
line 38706=>####-     'The  living  have  never  used that  road  since  the  coming  of  the 
line 38707=>Rohirrim,' said Aragorn, 'for it is closed to  them.  But  in this dark hour 
line 38708=>the heir of Isildur may use  it, if he  dare. Listen! This is the word  that 
line 38709=>the sons of  Elrond bring  to  me  from their father in Rivendell, wisest in 
line 38710=>lore: Bid  Aragorn remember  the words  of the  seer,  and the Paths of  the 
line 38711=>Dead.' 
line 38712=>     'And what may be the words of the seer?' said Legolas.  
line 38713=>     "Thus spoke  Malbeth the  Seer,  in the days of  Arvedui,  last king at 
line 38714=>Fornost,' said Aragorn: 
line 38715=>     Over the land there lies a long shadow,  
line 38716=>     westward reaching wings of darkness. 
line 38717=>     The Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings 
line 38718=>     doom approaches. The Dead awaken; 
line 38719=>     for the hour is come for the oathbreakers; 
line 38720=>     at the Stone of Erech they shall stand again  
line 38721=>     and hear there a horn in the hills ringing. 
line 38722=>     Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them 
line 38723=>     from the prey twilight, the forgotten people? 
line 38724=>     The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. 
line 38725=>     From the North shall he come, need shall drive him: 
line 38726=>     he shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead. 
line 38727=>     'Dark ways doubtless, said  Gimli, but no darker than these staves  are 
line 38728=>to me.' 
line 38729=>     'If you  would  understand them better, then I bid  you  come with me,' 
line 38730=>said Aragorn; 'for that way I now shall take. But I do  not go  gladly; only 
line 38731=>need drives me. Therefore, only of your free will would I have you come, for 
line 38732=>you will find both toil and great fear, and maybe worse.' 
line 38733=>     'I will go with you even on the Paths of the Dead, and to whatever, end 
line 38734=>they may lead,' said Gimli. 
line 38735=>     'I also will come,' said Legolas, 'for I do not fear the Dead.' 
line 38736=>     'I  hope  that the  forgotten people  will  not have  forgotten how  to 
line 38737=>fight,' said Gimli; 'for otherwise I see not why we should trouble them.' 
line 38738=>     'That we shall know if ever  we come to Erech,' said  Aragorn. 'But the 
line 38739=>oath  that  they broke  was  to  fight  against Sauron, and they must  fight 
line 38740=>therefore,  if  they are to fulfil it. For at Erech there stands yet a black  
line 38741=>stone that was brought, it was said, from N®menor by Isildur; and it was set 
line 38742=>upon a hill, and  upon it  the King of the Mountains swore allegiance to him 
line 38743=>
line 38744=>####-in  the beginning of the realm of Gondor. But when Sauron returned and  grew 
line 38745=>in might again, Isildur summoned the  Men of  the Mountains to  fulfil their 
line 38746=>oath, and they would not: for they had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years. 
line 38747=>     'Then Isildur said to  their king: "Thou shalt be the last king. And if 
line 38748=>the West prove mightier than thy  Black Master, this curse  I  lay upon thee 
line 38749=>and thy folk: to rest never until your oath is  fulfilled. For this war will 
line 38750=>last through years uncounted, and you  shall be summoned once again ere  the 
line 38751=>end."  And they fled  before  the  wrath of  Isildur, and did not dare to go 
line 38752=>forth to war on  Sauron's  part; and they hid themselves in secret places in 
line 38753=>the mountains and had no dealings with other men, but slowly dwindled in the 
line 38754=>barren hills. And the  terror of the Sleepless Dead lies  about  the Hill of 
line 38755=>Erech and all places  where that people  lingered. But that  way I  must go, 
line 38756=>since there are none living to help me.' 
line 38757=>     He stood up.  'Come!' he  cried, and drew his sword, and it  flashed in 
line 38758=>the twilit hall of the Burg. 'To the Stone of Erech! I seek the Paths of the 
line 38759=>Dead. Come with me who will!' 
line 38760=>     Legolas  and Gimli  made no answer,  but they rose and followed Aragorn 
line 38761=>from the  hall.  On  the green  there waited,  still and silent, the  hooded 
line 38762=>Rangers.  Legolas  and Gimli  mounted.  Aragorn  sprang upon  Roheryn.  
line 38763=>Then 
line 38764=>Halbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in Helm's Deep; and 
line 38765=>with that they leapt away, riding down the Coomb like thunder, while all the 
line 38766=>men that were left on Dike or Burg stared in amaze. 
line 38767=>     And  while Thjoden  went  by slow paths in the hills, the Grey  Company 
line 38768=>passed  swiftly  over the plain, and on the next day  in the  afternoon they 
line 38769=>came to Edoras;  and there they halted only briefly, ere they passed up  the 
line 38770=>valley, and so came to Dunharrow as darkness fell. 
line 38771=>     The  Lady  Jowyn greeted  them  and  was  glad of  their coming; for no 
line 38772=>mightier men had she seen than the D®nedain and the fair sons of Elrond; but 
line 38773=>on Aragorn most of  all her eyes rested.  And when  they sat at supper  with 
line 38774=>her, they talked  together, and  she heard  of  all that  had  passed  since 
line 38775=>Thjoden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings  had yet reached her; 
line 38776=>and when  she  heard of the battle in Helm's Deep and the great slaughter of 
line 38777=>their foes,  and of  the charge of  Thjoden and  his knights, then  her eyes 
line 38778=>shone. 
line 38779=>     But at last she said:  'Lords, you are weary and  shall now  go to  your 
line 38780=>beds  with  such ease  as can  be contrived in  haste.  But  tomorrow fairer  
line 38781=>
line 38782=>####-housing shall be found for you.' 
line 38783=>     But Aragorn said:  'Nay, lady, be  not troubled  for  us! If we may lie 
line 38784=>here tonight and break our fast tomorrow, it  will be enough. For  I ride on 
line 38785=>an errand most urgent, and with the first light of morning we must go.' 
line 38786=>     She smiled  on him and said: 'Then it was kindly done, lord, to ride so 
line 38787=>many miles out of your  way to bring tidings to Jowyn, and to speak with her 
line 38788=>in her exile.' 
line 38789=>     'Indeed no man would count such a  journey  wasted,' said Aragorn; 'and 
line 38790=>yet, lady, I could not have come hither, if  it were not that the road which 
line 38791=>I must take leads me to Dunharrow.' 
line 38792=>     And she answered  as one  that likes not what is said: "Then, lord, you  
line 38793=>are astray; for out of  Harrowdale no road  runs east or south; and  you had 
line 38794=>best return as you came.' 
line 38795=>     'Nay, lady,' said  he, 'I am  not astray; for I walked in this land ere 
line 38796=>you were born to grace it. There is a road out of this valley, and that road 
line 38797=>I shall take. Tomorrow I shall ride by the Paths of the Dead.' 
line 38798=>     Then she stared at him as one that is stricken,  and her face blanched, 
line 38799=>and  for long she  spoke no more, while all sat silent. 'But, Aragorn,'  she 
line 38800=>said at last,  'is it  then your errand to  seek death? For that  is all that 
line 38801=>you will find on that road. They do not suffer the living to pass.' 
line 38802=>     'They may suffer me  to pass,' said Aragorn; 'but at the  least I  will 
line 38803=>adventure it. No other road will serve.' 
line 38804=>     'But  this  is  madness,' she  said.  'For  here are  men of renown and 
line 38805=>prowess, whom you should not take into the shadows, but  should lead to war, 
line 38806=>where men are needed. I beg you to remain and ride with my brother; for then 
line 38807=>all our hearts will be gladdened, and our hope be the brighter.' 
line 38808=>     'It is  not madness, lady,' he answered; 'for I go on a path appointed. 
line 38809=>But those who follow  me do so of  their free will; and if they wish now  to 
line 38810=>remain and ride  with the  Rohirrim,  they  may do so. But  I shall take the 
line 38811=>Paths of the Dead, alone, if needs be.' 
line 38812=>     Then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever  
line 38813=>upon Aragorn, and the others  saw that she  was in great torment of mind. At  
line 38814=>length they arose, and took their leave of the Lady, and thanked her for her  
line 38815=>care, and went to their rest. 
line 38816=>     But as Aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with Legolas and 
line 38817=>Gimli, and  his companions had  gone in. there came the Lady Jowyn after him 
line 38818=>and called to him. He turned and saw her  as a glimmer in  the night, for she 
line 38819=>
line 38820=>####-was clad in white; but her eyes were on fire. 
line 38821=>     'Aragorn,' she said, 'why will you go on this deadly road?' 
line 38822=>     'Because I must,' he said. 'Only so can I see any hope of doing my part 
line 38823=>in the war against Sauron. I do not choose paths of peril, Jowyn. Were I  to 
line 38824=>go where my  heart dwells, far  in the North I would now be wandering in the 
line 38825=>fair valley of Rivendell.' 
line 38826=>     For a while she was silent, as if pondering what this  might mean. Then 
line 38827=>suddenly she laid her hand on his arm. 'You are  a stern lord and resolute,' 
line 38828=>she said; 'and thus  do  men  win renown.' She paused. 'Lord.' she said, 'if 
line 38829=>you must go, then let me ride in your  following. For I am weary of skulking 
line 38830=>in the hills, and wish to face peril and battle.' 
line 38831=>     'Your duty is wi th your people,' he answered. 
line 38832=>     'Too often have I heard of duty,' she cried. 'But am I not of the House 
line 38833=>of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? I have waited on faltering feet 
line 38834=>long enough.  Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not  now spend my 
line 38835=>life as I will?' 
line 38836=>     'Few may do that with honour,' he answered.  'But as for you, lady: did 
line 38837=>you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord's return? If 
line 38838=>you had not been chosen, then some marshal or captain would have been set in 
line 38839=>the same place, and he could not ride away from his charge, were he weary of 
line 38840=>it or no.' 
line 38841=>     'Shall I always be chosen?' she  said bitterly. 'Shall I always be left  
line 38842=>behind when the Riders depart, to mind the house while they  win renown, and 
line 38843=>find food and beds when they return?' 
line 38844=>     'A time may come  soon,' said he, 'when none  will return.  Then  there 
line 38845=>will be need of valour  without  renown,  for none shall remember the  deeds 
line 38846=>that  are done in  the last defence of your homes. Yet the deeds will not be 
line 38847=>less valiant because they are unpraised.' 
line 38848=>     And she answered: 'All  your words are but to say: you are a woman, and 
line 38849=>your part is in the house. But when  the men have died in battle and honour,  
line 38850=>you have leave to  be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. 
line 38851=>But I  am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman. I can ride and wield 
line 38852=>blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.' 
line 38853=>     'What do you fear, lady?' he asked. 
line 38854=>     'A cage,' she said. 'To stay behind bars, until use and old age  accept 
line 38855=>them, and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire.' 
line 38856=>     'And  yet you  counselled  me  not  to adventure on the road that I had 
line 38857=>
line 38858=>####-chosen, because it is perilous?' 
line 38859=>     'So may one counsel another,' she said. 'Yet I do not bid you flee from  
line 38860=>peril, but to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory.  I 
line 38861=>would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly.' 
line 38862=>     'Nor would I,' he  said. 'Therefore  I  say to you, lady: Stay! For you  
line 38863=>have no errand to the South.' 
line 38864=>     'Neither have those others who go with thee. They go  only because they 
line 38865=>would not be parted from thee  - because they love thee.' Then she turned and 
line 38866=>vanished into the night. 
line 38867=>     When the light of day was come into the  sky  but  the sun was  not yet 
line 38868=>risen above the high  ridges in the East,  Aragorn made ready to depart. His 
line 38869=>company was all mounted, and he was  about to leap into the saddle, when the 
line 38870=>Lady  Jowyn came to bid them farewell. She was clad as a Rider and girt with 
line 38871=>a sword. In her hand she bore a cup, and  she set it to her lips and drank a  
line 38872=>little, wishing them  good speed; and then she gave the cup to Aragorn,  and 
line 38873=>he drank, and he said:  'Farewell, Lady of Rohan! I drink to the fortunes of 
line 38874=>your House, and of you, and of all  your people. Say to your brother: beyond  
line 38875=>the shadows we may meet again!' 
line 38876=>     Then it seemed to Gimli  and Legolas who were nearby that she wept, and 
line 38877=>in one  so  stern and proud that seemed  the  more grievous.  But  she said: 
line 38878=>'Aragorn, wilt thou go?' 
line 38879=>     'I will,' he said. 
line 38880=>     'Then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as I have asked?' 
line 38881=>     'I will not, lady,' he said. 'For that I  could not grant without leave 
line 38882=>of the king and  of  your brother; and they will not return until  tomorrow.  
line 38883=>But I count now every hour, indeed every minute. Farewell!' 
line 38884=>     Then she fell on her knees, saying: 'I beg thee!' 
line 38885=>     'Nay, lady,' he said, and taking her by the hand he raised her. Then he 
line 38886=>kissed her hand, and sprang into the saddle, and rode away, and did not look  
line 38887=>back; and only  those who knew  him well and were  near to him saw  the pain 
line 38888=>that he bore. 
line 38889=>     But Jowyn stood still as  a figure carven in stone,  her hands clenched 
line 38890=>at her sides, and she watched  them until they passed into the shadows under  
line 38891=>the  black Dwimorberg,  the Haunted Mountain, in which was  the Gate of  the 
line 38892=>Dead.  When they were lost  to view, she turned,  stumbling  as  one that is 
line 38893=>blind, and went back to her lodging. But none of her folk  saw this parting, 
line 38894=>for they hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until  the  day was 
line 38895=>
line 38896=>####-up, and the reckless strangers were gone. 
line 38897=>     And some  said: 'They are Elvish wights. Let them go where they belong,  
line 38898=>into the dark places, and never return. The times are evil enough.' 
line 38899=>     The light was  still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed 
line 38900=>over the black ridges of the Haunted Mountain before  them. A dread  fell on 
line 38901=>them, even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to 
line 38902=>the Dimholt.  There under the  gloom of  black  trees  that not even Legolas 
line 38903=>could long  endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountain's root, 
line 38904=>and right in their path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom. 
line 38905=>     'My blood runs chill,'  said Gimli, but the others were silent, and his 
line 38906=>voice fell dead on  the  dank fir-needles at his feet. The horses  would not 
line 38907=>pass the threatening stone, until the riders dismounted and led them  about. 
line 38908=>And so they came at last deep into the glen; and there stood a sheer wall of 
line 38909=>rock, and in  the wall the Dark  Door  gaped  before them like  the mouth of 
line 38910=>night.  Signs and figures were  carved above its  wide arch too dim to read, 
line 38911=>and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour. 
line 38912=>     The company halted, and there was  not a  heart among them that did not  
line 38913=>quail, unless it were the heart of Legolas of the Elves, for whom the ghosts 
line 38914=>of Men have no terror. 
line 38915=>     'This is an  evil door,' said Halbarad, 'and my death lies beyond it. I 
line 38916=>will dare to pass it nonetheless; but no horse will enter.' 
line 38917=>     'But  we must go  in,  and therefore  the horses  must  go  too,'  said 
line 38918=>Aragorn.  'For if ever  we  come  through this  darkness,  many  leagues lie 
line 38919=>beyond, and every hour  that is lost there will bring the triumph  of Sauron 
line 38920=>nearer. Follow me!' 
line 38921=>     Then Aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will in that 
line 38922=>hour  that all the D®nedain and  their horses  followed him. And  indeed the 
line 38923=>love that the horses of the Rangers bore for their riders was  so great that 
line 38924=>they were willing  to face even the  terror  of the Door, if  their masters' 
line 38925=>hearts were steady as they walked beside them. But Arod, the horse of Rohan, 
line 38926=>refused  the  way, and he stood sweating and trembling  in a  fear  that was 
line 38927=>grievous to see. Then Legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words 
line 38928=>that  went  soft in the  gloom, until he  suffered himself  to  be  led, and 
line 38929=>Legolas passed in. And there stood Gimli the Dwarf left all alone. 
line 38930=>     His knees shook,  and  he  was wroth  with himself.  'Here is  a  thing 
line 38931=>unheard of!' he said. 'An  Elf  will go underground and a  Dwarf  dare not!' 
line 38932=>With that he plunged in. But it seemed to him  that he dragged his feet like 
line 38933=>
line 38934=>####-lead over the threshold; and at once a blindness  came  upon him,  even upon 
line 38935=>Gimli Gluin's son who had walked unafraid in many deep places of the world. 
line 38936=>     Aragorn  had  brought  torches from Dunharrow,  and  now he went  ahead 
line 38937=>bearing one  aloft; and Elladan with  another went  at the rear, and  Gimli, 
line 38938=>stumbling behind, strove to overtake him. He could  see nothing  but the dim 
line 38939=>flame  of the tor ches; but  if the company halted, there  seemed  an endless 
line 38940=>whisper of voices all about him, a murmur of words in no tongue  that he had 
line 38941=>ever heard before. 
line 38942=>     Nothing assailed  the  company  nor  withstood  their passage,  and yet 
line 38943=>steadily fear grew on the Dwarf as  he went on:  most of all because he knew 
line 38944=>now that there could be no  turning back; all the paths behind were thronged 
line 38945=>by an unseen host that followed in the dark. 
line 38946=>     So time unreckoned passed, until Gimli  saw a  sight that he  was  ever 
line 38947=>afterwards loth to recall. The road was  wide, as far as he could judge, but 
line 38948=>now the company came  suddenly  into a great empty space, and there  were no 
line 38949=>longer any walls upon either side. The dread  was  so  heavy on him  that he 
line 38950=>could  hardly walk. Away  to the  left  something glittered  in the gloom as 
line 38951=>Aragorn's  torch drew near.  Then Aragorn halted and  went  to look  what it  
line 38952=>might be. 
line 38953=>     'Does  he  feel no fear?' muttered the  Dwarf. 'In any other cave Gimli 
line 38954=>Gluin's son would have been  the first to run to the gleam of gold.  But not 
line 38955=>here! Let it lie!' 
line 38956=>     Nonetheless he drew near,  and saw Aragorn kneeling, while Elladan held 
line 38957=>aloft both torches. Before him were the bones of  a  mighty man. He had been 
line 38958=>clad  in  mail, and still his harness lay there  whole; for the cavern's air 
line 38959=>was as dry as dust, and his  hauberk  was gilded. His belt  was  of gold and 
line 38960=>garnets, and rich with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on 
line 38961=>the floor. He  had fallen  near the far  wall  of the cave, as now could  be 
line 38962=>seen, and before  him stood a  stony door closed fast: his finger -bones were 
line 38963=>still clawing at the cracks. A notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he 
line 38964=>had hewn at the rock in his last despair. 
line 38965=>     Aragorn did  not touch him, but after gazing silently for  a  while  he 
line 38966=>rose  and sighed. 'Hither  shall the flowers of  simbelmynl come never  unto 
line 38967=>world's  end,' he murmured. 'Nine mounds and seven there are now  green with 
line 38968=>grass, and through all the long years he has lain at the door that  he could 
line 38969=>not unlock. Whither does it lead? Why would he pass? None shall ever know!  
line 38970=>     'For that is not my errand!' he cried, turning back and speaking to the 
line 38971=>
line 38972=>####-whispering darkness behind. 'Keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the 
line 38973=>Accursed Years! Speed only we ask.  Let us pass, and then come! I summon 
line 38974=>you 
line 38975=>to the Stone of Erech!' 
line 38976=>     There was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than 
line 38977=>the whispers  before;  and  then  a chill  blast came in  which  the torches 
line 38978=>flickered and  went  out,  and could not be  rekindled.  Of  the  time  that 
line 38979=>followed, one hour  or many, Gimli remembered little. The others pressed on, 
line 38980=>but  he  was ever hindmost, pursued  by a groping horror that  seemed always 
line 38981=>just  about to seize  him; and a rumour came after him lik e the shadow-sound 
line 38982=>of many feet. He  stumbled  on until he  was  crawling  like a beast on  the 
line 38983=>ground and felt that he could endure no more: he  must either find an ending 
line 38984=>and escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear. 
line 38985=>     Suddenly he  heard the  tinkle of water, a sound hard and  clear  as  a  
line 38986=>stone falling into a dream of dark shadow. Light  grew, and lo! the  company 
line 38987=>passed  through another  gateway, high-arched and broad, and a rill  ran out 
line 38988=>beside  them;  and  beyond, going  steeply  down, was  a road between  sheer 
line 38989=>cliffs, knife-edged against the sky  far above.  So deep and narrow was that 
line 38990=>chasm  that  the sky was  dark, and in it small stars  glinted. Yet as Gimli 
line 38991=>after learned it was still two hours ere sunset of the day on which they had 
line 38992=>set out from Dunharrow; though for all that he could then tell it might have 
line 38993=>been twilight in some later year, or in some other world. 
line 38994=>     The Company now mounted again, and Gimli returned to Legolas. They 
line 38995=>rode 
line 38996=>in  file, and evening came on and a  deep blue  dusk; and still fear pursued 
line 38997=>them. Legolas turning to speak to Gimli looked back and the Dwarf saw before 
line 38998=>his face  the glitter in the Elf's  bright  eyes. Behind them rode  Elladan, 
line 38999=>last of the Company, but not the last of those that took the downward road. 
line 39000=>     'The  Dead are following,'  said Legolas. 'I  see shapes  of Men and of 
line 39001=>horses,  and  pale  banners  like   shreds   of   cloud,  and   spears  like 
line 39002=>winter -thickets on a misty night. The Dead are following.' 
line 39003=>     'Yes, the Dead ride behind. They have been summoned,' said Elladan. 
line 39004=>     The Company  came at last out of the ravine, as suddenly as it they had 
line 39005=>issued  from  a crack in a wall; and there  lay the uplands  of a great vale 
line 39006=>before them,  and the stream  beside them went down with a  cold  voice over 
line 39007=>many falls.  
line 39008=>     'Where  in Middle-earth are we?' said Gimli; and Elladan answered:  'We 
line 39009=>
line 39010=>####-have descended  from the uprising of the Morthond, the long chill river that 
line 39011=>flows at last to the sea that washes the  walls of Dol Amroth. You  will not 
line 39012=>need to ask hereafter how comes its name: Blackroot men call it.' 
line 39013=>     The  Morthond Vale made a  great  bay that beat up  against  the  sheer  
line 39014=>southern faces of the  mountains. Its steep slopes were grass-grown; but all 
line 39015=>was grey in that  hour, for the  sun had gone, and  far below lights twinkled 
line 39016=>in the homes of Men. The vale was rich and many folk dwelt there. 
line 39017=>     Then without  turning  Aragorn  cried aloud so  that  all  could  hear: 
line 39018=>'Friends, forget your weariness! Ride now, ride!  We  must come to the Stone 
line 39019=>of Erech ere this day passes, and long still is the way.' So without looking 
line 39020=>back they rode  the mountain-fields, until they came to  a  bridge over  the 
line 39021=>growing torrent and found a road that went down into the land. 
line 39022=>     Lights went out in house  and hamlet as they came, and doors  were shut, 
line 39023=>and folk that were  afield cried in terror and ran  wild  like  hunted deer. 
line 39024=>Ever there rose the same cry in the gathering  night: 'The King of the Dead!  
line 39025=>The King of the Dead is come upon us!' 
line 39026=>     Bells  wer e ringing far  below, and all men  fled  before  the face  of 
line 39027=>Aragorn; but the Grey  Company in their haste rode like hunters, until their 
line 39028=>horses were stumbling  with weariness. And thus, just ere midnight, and in a  
line 39029=>darkness  as black as the caverns in the  mountains, they came at last to the 
line 39030=>Hill of Erech. 
line 39031=>     Long had the terror of  the Dead lain upon that hill and upon the empty 
line 39032=>fields about it. For upon  the  top stood  a  black stone, round  as a great 
line 39033=>globe,  the  height  of a man, though its  half  was buried  in the  ground. 
line 39034=>Unearthly it looked, as though it had fallen from the sky, as some believed; 
line 39035=>but those who remembered still the lore of Westernesse told that it had been 
line 39036=>brought out of the ruin of N®menor and there  set by Isildur at his landing . 
line 39037=>None of the people of the valley dared to approach it, nor would  they dwell  
line 39038=>near;  for  they said  that it was a trysting-place  of  the Shadow-men, and 
line 39039=>there  they would  gather in  times  of fear, thronging round  the Stone and 
line 39040=>whispering. 
line 39041=>     To tha t Stone  the Company came and halted in the  dead  of night. Then  
line 39042=>Elrohir gave to Aragorn a silver horn, and he blew upon it and  it seemed to 
line 39043=>those that stood near  that they heard a sound of answering  horns, as if it 
line 39044=>was  an echo in deep caves far away. No other sound they heard, and yet they 
line 39045=>were aware of a great host gathered  all about the hill on which they stood; 
line 39046=>and a chill wind like the breath of ghosts came down from the mountains. But 
line 39047=>
line 39048=>####-Aragorn dismounted, and standing by the Stone he cried in a great voice: 
line 39049=>     'Oathbreakers, why have ye come?' 
line 39050=>     And a voice  was heard  out of the  night that answered him, as if from 
line 39051=>far away: 
line 39052=>     'To fulfil our oath and have peace.' 
line 39053=>     Then Aragorn said: 'The hour is come at last. Now I go to Pelargir upon 
line 39054=>Anduin, and ye shall come after  me. And when all this land is clean  of the 
line 39055=>servants  of Sauron, I will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace 
line 39056=>and depart for ever. For I am Elessar, Isildur's heir of Gondor.' 
line 39057=>     And with that he  bade Halbarad unfurl  the great standard which he had 
line 39058=>brought; and behold! it was black, and if  there was any device upon  it, it 
line 39059=>was hidden in the darkness. Then there was silence, and  not a whisper nor a  
line 39060=>sigh  was heard  again all the long  night.  The  Company camped  beside the 
line 39061=>Stone,  but  they slept little, because  of the dread  of  the Shadows  that 
line 39062=>hedged them round. 
line 39063=>     But when the dawn came, cold and pale, Aragorn rose at once, and he led  
line 39064=>the Company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and  weariness that any 
line 39065=>among them  had known, save he  alone, and only his will held them to go on. 
line 39066=>No  other mortal Men  could  have endured it, none but the  D®nedain  of the 
line 39067=>North, and with them Gimli the Dwarf and Legolas of the Elves.  
line 39068=>     They  passed Tarlang's Neck and came  into Lamedon; and the Shadow 
line 39069=>Host 
line 39070=>pressed behind and  fear went on  before them,  until they  came to Calembel 
line 39071=>upon Ciril,  and the sun  went down like  blood behind Pinnath Gelin away in 
line 39072=>the West  behind them.  The township  and  the  fords  of  Ciril  they found 
line 39073=>deserted,  for many men had gone away to war, and all that were left fled to  
line 39074=>the hills at the  rumour of the coming of the King of the Dead. But the next 
line 39075=>day there  came no dawn, and the Grey Company passed on into the darkness 
line 39076=>of 
line 39077=>the Storm  of  Mordor and were lost  to  mortal sight; but the Dead followed 
line 39078=>them. 
line 39079=> 
line 39080=>

line 39083=>Chapter 3. The Muster of Rohan 
line 39084=>
line 39085=> 
line 39086=> 
line 39087=>     Now all roads were running together to  the  East to meet the coming of 
line 39088=>war and the onset of the Shadow. And even as Pippin  stood at the Great Gate 
line 39089=>of the City  and saw the Prince of Dol Amroth ride in with  his banners, the 
line 39090=>King of Rohan came down out of the hills. 
line 39091=>     Day  was waning. In  the last  rays  of the  sun  the Riders  cast long 
line 39092=>pointed shadows that went on before them. Darkness had already crept beneath 
line 39093=>the murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain-sides. The king rode 
line 39094=>now  slowly at the end  of  the day. Presently the  path turned round a huge 
line 39095=>bare  shoulder of rock and plunged into the  gloom  of  soft -sighing  trees.  
line 39096=>Down, down they went in a long winding file. When  at last they came  to the 
line 39097=>bottom of  the gorge they  found that evening had fallen in the deep places.  
line 39098=>The sun was gone. Twilight lay upon the waterfalls. 
line 39099=>     All day far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass 
line 39100=>behind, cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad  walls; and now  through a  
line 39101=>stony  gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale. The Riders  followed 
line 39102=>it, and suddenly Harrowdale lay before  them, loud with  the noise of waters 
line 39103=>in the evening. There the white Snowbourn, joined by the lesser stream, went 
line 39104=>rushing, fuming on  the  stones,  down to Edoras and the green hills and the 
line 39105=>plains. Away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty Starkhorn 
line 39106=>loomed up above its  vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but  its jagged peak, 
line 39107=>clothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the world, blue-shadowed upon 
line 39108=>the East, red-stained by the sunset in the West. 
line 39109=>     Merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country,  of which he  had 
line 39110=>heard many tales upon their long road.  It was a skyless world, in which his 
line 39111=>eye; through dim gulfs of shadowy  air, saw only ever-mounting slopes, great 
line 39112=>walls of  stone behind  great  walls, and  frowning precipices wreathed with 
line 39113=>mist.  He sat  for a moment half dreaming, listening to  the noise of water, 
line 39114=>the  whisper of dark trees, the crack of stone, and the vast waiting silence 
line 39115=>that brooded  behind all sound. He  loved  mountains,  or he had  loved  the 
line 39116=>thought of them marching  on the edge of  stories brought from far away;  but 
line 39117=>now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of Middle-earth. He 
line 39118=>longed 
line 39119=>to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire. 
line 39120=>     He was very tired, for though they had  ridden slowly, they had  ridden 
line 39121=>
line 39122=>####-with very  little  rest. Hour after  hour for nearly three weary days he had 
line 39123=>jogged  up  and down, over passes, and through long dales,  and  across many 
line 39124=>streams. Sometimes where the way  was  broader he  had ridden at  the king's 
line 39125=>side, not noticing that many  of the Riders smiled to see  the two together: 
line 39126=>the  hobbit  on his little shaggy grey pony,  and the Lord of  Rohan on  his 
line 39127=>great white horse. Then he had talked to Thjoden, telling him about his home 
line 39128=>and the doings of  the Shire-folk, or listening in turn to tales of the Mark 
line 39129=>and its  mighty  men of old.  But most of the time, especially  on this last 
line 39130=>day, Merry had ridden  by himself just behind the  king, saying nothing, and 
line 39131=>trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of Rohan that he heard the men 
line 39132=>behind him using. It was  a  language in which there seemed to be many words 
line 39133=>that he  knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the Shire, yet  
line 39134=>he could not piece the words together. At times some Rider would lift up his 
line 39135=>clear voice in stirring song,  and Merry felt his heart leap, though he  did 
line 39136=>not know what it was about. 
line 39137=>     All the  same  he had been lonely, and  never more so  than now at  the 
line 39138=>day's end.  He wondered where  in all this strange world  Pippin had got to; 
line 39139=>and what would become of Aragorn and Legolas and Gimli. Then suddenly 
line 39140=>like a 
line 39141=>cold touch on his heart he thought of Frodo and Sam. 'I am forgetting them!' 
line 39142=>he said  to himself reproachfully. 'And yet they are more important than all 
line 39143=>the  rest of us. And I  came to help them; but now  they must be hundreds of 
line 39144=>miles away, if they are still alive.' He shivered. 
line 39145=>     'Harrowdale at  last!' said Jomer. 'Our journey  is almost at  an end.' 
line 39146=>They halted. The paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. Only a glimpse,  
line 39147=>as  through a tall window, could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming 
line 39148=>below. A single small light could be seen twinkling by the river. 
line 39149=>     'This journey is over, maybe,' said Thjoden, 'but I have far yet to go. 
line 39150=>Last night the  moon was full, and in the morning I shall ride to Edoras  to 
line 39151=>the gathering of the Mark.' 
line 39152=>     'But if you would take my  counsel,'  said  Jomer  in a low voice, 'you  
line 39153=>would then return hither, until the war is over, lost or won.' 
line 39154=>     Thjoden smiled.  'Nay,  my son, for  so I will call you, speak  not the 
line 39155=>soft words of Wormtongue in my old ears!' He drew himself up and looked 
line 39156=>back 
line 39157=>at the long line of his men fading into the dusk behind. 'Long years  in the 
line 39158=>space of days it seems since I rode west;  but never  will I lean on a staff 
line 39159=>
line 39160=>####-again. If the war is lost, what good will be my hiding in the hills? And  if 
line 39161=>it is won, what grief will it be, even if I fall, spending my last strength?  
line 39162=>But we will leave this now. Tonight I will lie in the Hold of Dunharrow. One 
line 39163=>evening of peace at least is left us. Let us ride on! ' 
line 39164=>     In  the  deepening  dusk  they came  down  into  the  valley. Here  the 
line 39165=>Snowbourn flowed near  to the western walls of  the dale, and soon the  path 
line 39166=>led them to a ford where the shallow  waters murmured  loudly on the stones. 
line 39167=>The ford was guarded.   As the king approached many men sprang up out of  the 
line 39168=>shadow of the rocks; and when they saw the king they cried with glad voices:  
line 39169=>'Thjoden King! Thjoden King! The King of the Mark returns!' 
line 39170=>     Then one blew a long call on  a horn.  It  echoed in the  valley. Other  
line 39171=>horns answered it, and lights shone out across the river. 
line 39172=>     And suddenly  there  rose a great chorus of  trumpets from high  above, 
line 39173=>sounding from some hollow  place, as  it seemed, that gathered  their  notes 
line 39174=>into one voice and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of stone. 
line 39175=>     So the  King  of  the Mark came back  victorious  out  of the  West  to 
line 39176=>Dunharrow  beneath  the feet  of  the White  Mountains. There he  found  the 
line 39177=>remaining  strength  of  his people  already assembled; for as soon  as  his 
line 39178=>coming was known captains rode to  meet  him at  the ford,  bearing messages 
line 39179=>from Gandalf. D®nhere,  chieftain of  the  folk of Harrowdale, was at  their 
line 39180=>head. 
line 39181=>     'At dawn three  days ago,  lord,' he  said. 'Shadowfax came like a wind 
line 39182=>out of  the West to  Edoras, and Gandalf brought  tidings of your victory to 
line 39183=>gladden  our  hearts.  But  he  brought also  word from you  to  hasten  the 
line 39184=>gathering of the Riders. And then came the winged Shadow.' 
line 39185=>     'The winged Shadow?' said Thjoden. 'We saw it also, but that was in the 
line 39186=>dead of night before Gandalf left us.' 
line 39187=>     'Maybe, lord,' said D®nhere. 'Yet the same, or  another like to  it,  a  
line 39188=>flying darkness in  the shape of a  monstrous bird, passed  over Edoras that 
line 39189=>morning, and all men were  shaken with fear. For it  stooped  upon Meduseld, 
line 39190=>and  as it came low, almost to the gable,  there came a cry that stopped our 
line 39191=>hearts.  Then  it was that  Gandalf  counselled  us  not to  assemble in the 
line 39192=>fields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mounta ins. And  he bade 
line 39193=>us to kindle no more lights or fires than  barest need asked. So it has been 
line 39194=>done. Gandalf spoke with great authority. We trust that it is as  you  would 
line 39195=>wish. Naught has been seen in Harrowdale of these evil things.' 
line 39196=>     'It is well,' said Thjoden. 'I  will ride  now  to  the Hold, and there 
line 39197=>
line 39198=>####-before  I go to rest I will meet the marshals and captains. Let them come to 
line 39199=>me as soon as may be!' 
line 39200=>     The road now led eastward straight across the valley, which was at that 
line 39201=>point little more than half a mile in width. Flats and meads of rough grass,  
line 39202=>grey now in the falling night,  lay all about, but  in front on the far side 
line 39203=>of the dale Merry saw a frowning wall, a last outlier of the great  roots of 
line 39204=>the Starkhorn, cloven by the river in ages past . 
line 39205=>     On all the level spaces there was great concourse of men. Some thronged 
line 39206=>to the  roadside, hailing  the king and the riders  from the West with  glad 
line 39207=>cries; but stretching away into the distance behind there  were ordered rows 
line 39208=>of tents and booths, and lines of picketed horses,  and great store of arms, 
line 39209=>and piled spears bristling like  thickets of new-planted trees. Now  all the 
line 39210=>great assembly was falling into shadow, and yet, though the night -chill blew 
line 39211=>cold  from  the heights  no  lanterns  glowed, no fires  were  lit. Watchmen 
line 39212=>heavily cloaked paced to and fro. 
line 39213=>     Merry wondered  how many Riders there  were. He  could  not guess their 
line 39214=>number in the gathering gloom, but it  looked to him like a great army, many 
line 39215=>thousands strong. While  he was  peering from side  to side the king's party 
line 39216=>came up under the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley; and there 
line 39217=>suddenly the path began to climb, and Merry looked up in  amazement.  He 
line 39218=>was 
line 39219=>on a road the like of which he had never seen before,  a great work of men's 
line 39220=>hands in years beyond the  reach of  song. Upwards it wound, coiling  like a  
line 39221=>snake, boring its way across the  sheer slope of rock.  Steep as a stair, it 
line 39222=>looped  backwards and forwards as it  climbed. Up it horses  could walk, and 
line 39223=>wains  could be slowly hauled; but no  enemy could come that way, except out 
line 39224=>of the air,  if it was defended from above. At each turn  of the road  there 
line 39225=>were great standing stones that had been carved in the likeness of men, huge 
line 39226=>and clumsy-limbed, squatting cross-legged  with  their stumpy arms folded on 
line 39227=>fat bellies. Some in the wearing of the years had lost all features save the 
line 39228=>dark  holes of  their eyes that  still stared  sadly  at the passers-by. The 
line 39229=>Riders hardly glanced at them.  The  P®kel-men they  called them, and heeded 
line 39230=>them little:  no power or terror was left in them; but  Merry  gazed at them 
line 39231=>with wonder  and a feeling almost of pity,  as they loomed up  mournfully in 
line 39232=>the dusk. 
line 39233=>     After a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some 
line 39234=>hundreds of feet  above the valley, but still far below he could dimly see a  
line 39235=>
line 39236=>####-winding  line of Riders crossing the ford and filing along the  road towards 
line 39237=>the camp prepared for  them. Only the king  and his guard were going up into 
line 39238=>the Hold. 
line 39239=>     At last the king's company came to a sharp brink, and the climbing road 
line 39240=>passed into a cutting between walls of rock, and  so went  up a  short slope 
line 39241=>and  out  on  to a  wide  upland.  The  Firienfeld  men called it,  a  green 
line 39242=>mountain-field of grass and heath, high above the deep -delved courses of the 
line 39243=>Snowbourn,  laid upon the lap of the great mountains  behind:  the Starkhorn 
line 39244=>southwards, and northwards the saw-toothed mass of  Irensaga, between  which 
line 39245=>there faced the riders, the  grim black wall  of the Dwimorberg, the Haunted 
line 39246=>Mountain rising out of  steep slopes of  sombre  pines. Dividing the  upland 
line 39247=>into  two  there  marched  a double  line of unshaped standing  stones  that 
line 39248=>dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the  trees. Those who dared to follow 
line 39249=>that road came soon to the black Dimholt under Dwimorberg, and the menace 
line 39250=>of 
line 39251=>the pillar of stone, and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door. 
line 39252=>     Such was the dark Dunharrow, the work of long -forgotten men. Their name 
line 39253=>was lost and no song or legend remembered it. For what purpose they had 
line 39254=>made 
line 39255=>this place,  as a town  or secret temple or a tomb of kings, none could say. 
line 39256=>Here they laboured in the Dark Years, before ever a ship came to the western 
line 39257=>shores, or Gondor of the D®nedain was built; and now  they had vanished, and 
line 39258=>only the old P®kel -men were left, still sitting at the turnings of the road. 
line 39259=>     Merry stared at the lines of marching stones: they were worn and black; 
line 39260=>some  were  leaning, some were  fallen,  some cracked or broken; they looked 
line 39261=>like  rows  of old  and hungry teeth. He wondered what they could be, and he 
line 39262=>hoped  that the king was not going to follow  them into the darkness beyond.  
line 39263=>Then  he saw that there were  clusters of tents and booths on either side of 
line 39264=>the stony way; but these were not set near the  trees, and seemed rather  to 
line 39265=>huddle  away  from them towards the  brink of the  cliff. The greater number  
line 39266=>were on the right, where the Firienfeld was wider; and on the left there was 
line 39267=>a smaller camp, in the midst of which stood a  tall pavilion. From this side 
line 39268=>a rider now came out to meet them, and they turned from the road. 
line 39269=>     As  they drew near  Merry  saw  that  the rider was a  woman  with long 
line 39270=>braided hair gleaming  in the twilight,  yet she wore a helm and was clad to 
line 39271=>the waist like a warrior and girded with a sword. 
line 39272=>     'Hail,  Lord of  the  Mark!'  she  cried. 'My  heart  is  glad  at your 
line 39273=>
line 39274=>####-returning.' 
line 39275=>     'And you, Jowyn,' said Thjoden, 'is all well with you?' 
line 39276=>     'All  is well,' she  answered; yet it  seemed to  Merry  that her voice 
line 39277=>belied her,  and he would have  thought that she had  been weeping, if  that 
line 39278=>could be believed of one so stern of face. 'All is well. It was a weary road 
line 39279=>for  the people to  take,  torn suddenly  from their homes.  There were hard 
line 39280=>words, for it is long since war  has driven  us from  the green fields;  but 
line 39281=>there have been no evil deeds.  All  is now ordered, as  you  see. And  your 
line 39282=>lodging is prepared for you; for I have had full tidings of you and knew the 
line 39283=>hour of your coming.' 
line 39284=>     'So Aragorn has come then,' said Jomer. 'Is he still here?' 
line 39285=>     'No, he is gone,' said Jowyn turning away and  looking at the mountains 
line 39286=>dark against the East and South. 
line 39287=>     'Whither did he go?' asked Jomer. 
line 39288=>     'I  do not  know,'  she answered.  'He  came at  night,  and rode  away 
line 39289=>yestermorn, ere the Sun had climbed over the mountain-tops. He is gone.' 
line 39290=>     'You are grieved, daughter,' said Thjoden. 'What has happened? Tell me, 
line 39291=>did  he speak  of  that road?' He pointed  away along the darkening lines of 
line 39292=>stones towards the Dwimorberg. 'Of the Paths of the Dead?' 
line 39293=>     'Yes, lord,' said Jowyn. 'And he has passed into the shadows from which 
line 39294=>none have returned. I could not dissuade him. He is gone.' 
line 39295=>     'Then our paths are sundered,' said  Jomer. 'He is  lost.  We must ride 
line 39296=>without him, and our hope dwindles.' 
line 39297=>     Slowly they  passed through the short heath and  upland grass, speaking 
line 39298=>no  more, until they  came to the king's pavilion.  There  Merry  found that 
line 39299=>everything  was made ready, and that he himself was not forgotten. A  little 
line 39300=>tent had been pitched for  him beside the king's  lodging; and there he  sat 
line 39301=>alone,  while men passed to and fro, going in to the king and taking counsel 
line 39302=>with him. Night came on, and the half-seen heads of  the mountains  westward 
line 39303=>were  crowned  with  stars, but the East was dark  and  blank.  The marching 
line 39304=>stones  faded slowly  from sight,  but still beyond them,  blacker than  the 
line 39305=>gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the Dwimorberg. 
line 39306=>     'The  Paths  of the Dead,'  he muttered to himself. 'The  Paths  of the 
line 39307=>Dead? What does all this mean? They have all left me now. They have all gone 
line 39308=>to some doom:  Gandalf and Pippin to  war in the East; and  Sam and Frodo to 
line 39309=>Mordor; and  Strider and  Legolas and Gimli to the Paths of the Dead. But my 
line 39310=>turn will come  soon enough, I suppose. I  wonder what they are all  talking 
line 39311=>
line 39312=>####-about, and what the king means to do. For I must go where he goes now.' 
line 39313=>     In the midst of these  gloomy  thoughts  he suddenly remembered that he 
line 39314=>was very hungry, and he got  up to go and see if anyone else in this strange 
line 39315=>camp felt the  same.  But at  that very moment a trumpet sounded, and  a man 
line 39316=>came summoning him, the king's esquire, to wait at the king's board. 
line 39317=>     In the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with 
line 39318=>broidered  hangings, and strewn  with skins:  and there at a small table sat 
line 39319=>Thjoden with Jomer and Jowyn, and D®nhere,  lord of  Harrowdale. Merry 
line 39320=>stood 
line 39321=>beside the king's stool and waited on him till presently the old man, coming 
line 39322=>out of deep thought, turned to him and smiled. 
line 39323=>     'Come, Master Meriadoc!'  he said. 'You shall  not stand. You shall sit 
line 39324=>beside me, as long  as I remain  in my own lands, and lighten my heart  with 
line 39325=>tales.' 
line 39326=>     Room was made for the hobbit at the king's left hand, but no one called 
line 39327=>for any tale. There was indeed little speech, and they ate and drank for the 
line 39328=>most  part in silence, until at last, plucking up courage,  Merry  asked the 
line 39329=>question that was tormenting him. 
line 39330=>     'Twice  now, lord, I have heard  of the  Paths of the  Dead,'  he  said. 
line 39331=>'What are  they? And where has Strider, I mean the Lord Aragorn where has he 
line 39332=>gone?' 
line 39333=>     The king sighed, but no one answered, until at last Jomer spoke. 'We do 
line 39334=>not know, and our hearts are heavy,' he  said. 'But as  for the Paths of the 
line 39335=>Dead, you have yourself walked on their  first steps. Nay. I speak no  words 
line 39336=>of  ill  omen! The road that  we have  climbed is  the approach to the Door, 
line 39337=>yonder in the Dimholt. But what lies beyond no man knows.' 
line 39338=>     'No man knows,' said  Thjoden:  'yet ancient legend, now seldom spoken,  
line 39339=>has  somewhat to  report. If these old  tales speak true that have come down 
line 39340=>from father to son in the House  of  Eorl, then  the  Door  under Dwimorberg 
line 39341=>leads to a  secret way that goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end.  
line 39342=>But none  have ever  ventured in to search its secrets, since Baldor, son of 
line 39343=>Brego, passed the  Door  and was  never seen among men again. A rash  vow 
line 39344=>he 
line 39345=>spoke,  as he drained  the  horn  at that feast which  Brego made  to hallow 
line 39346=>new-built Meduseld,  and he came never to the  high seat of which he was the 
line 39347=>heir. 
line 39348=>     'Folk say that Dead Men  out of the Dark Years guard  the way  and will 
line 39349=>
line 39350=>####-suffer no living man to come to their  hidden halls;  but at whiles they may 
line 39351=>themselves  be seen passing out of the door  like shadows and down  the stony 
line 39352=>road. Then the people of Harrowdale  shut fast  their doors and shroud their 
line 39353=>windows and are afraid. But the Dead come seldom forth and only  at times of 
line 39354=>great unquiet and coming death.' 
line 39355=>     'Yet it is said in Harrowdale,' said Jowyn in a low voice. 'that in the 
line 39356=>moonless nights but little  while ago  a great host in  strange array passed 
line 39357=>by. Whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and 
line 39358=>vanished 
line 39359=>into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.' 
line 39360=>     'Then why  has Aragorn  gone that  way?'  asked Merry. 'Don't you  know 
line 39361=>anything that would explain it?' 
line 39362=>     'Unless  he has  spoken  words  to  you as his friend that we  have not 
line 39363=>heard,'  said  Jomer,  'none now  in  the land of the  living  can tell  his 
line 39364=>purpose.' 
line 39365=>     'Greatly  changed he seemed to  me since I saw him first  in the king's 
line 39366=>house,' said Jowyn: 'grimmer, older.  Fey I thought  him, and  like one whom 
line 39367=>the Dead call.' 
line 39368=>     'Maybe  he was called,' said  Thjoden;  'and my  heart  tells me that I 
line 39369=>shall  not see him again.  Yet he is a kingly man of high  destiny. And take 
line 39370=>comfort in this,  daughter, since comfort you seem to need in your grief for  
line 39371=>this guest.  It is said  that  when the Eorlingas  came out of the North and 
line 39372=>passed  at length up the  Snowbourn, seeking strong places of refuge in time 
line 39373=>of need, Brego and his son Baldor climbed the Stair of the  Hold and so came 
line 39374=>before  the Door.  On  the threshold sat an  old man, aged beyond  guess  of 
line 39375=>years; tall and kingly he had been, but now he was withered as an old stone.  
line 39376=>Indeed for stone they took him, for he moved not, and he said no word, until 
line 39377=>they sought to pass him  by and enter. And then a  voice came out of him, as 
line 39378=>it were out  of  the ground,  and  to  their amaze  it spoke in  the western 
line 39379=>tongue: The way is shut. 
line 39380=>     'Then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still; but he 
line 39381=>did not  look at them.  The way is shut, his voice said again It was made by 
line 39382=>those who  are Dead,  and the Dead keep it, until the time comes. The way is  
line 39383=>shut. 
line 39384=>     'And  when  will that time be? said Baldor. But  no answer  did he ever  
line 39385=>get. For the old man died in that hour  and fell upon his face; and no other  
line 39386=>tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned. 
line 39387=>
line 39388=>####-Yet maybe at last the time foretold has come, and Aragorn may pass.' 
line 39389=>     'But how  shall a man discover whether that time be come or no, save by 
line 39390=>daring the Door?' said  Jomer. 'And that way  I would not go  though all the 
line 39391=>hosts of Mordor stood before me, and  I were alone and had no other  refuge. 
line 39392=>Alas that a fey mood should  fall  on a  man so greathearted in this hour of 
line 39393=>need! Are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the 
line 39394=>earth? War is at hand.' 
line 39395=>     He  paused, for at that moment there was a noise outside, a man's voice 
line 39396=>crying the name of Thjoden, and the challenge of the guard. 
line 39397=>     Presently the captain of the Guard thrust aside the curtain. 'A  man is 
line 39398=>here, lord,' he  said, 'an errand-rider of Gondor. He wishes to come  before 
line 39399=>you at once.' 
line 39400=>     'Let him come!' said Thjoden. 
line 39401=>     A tall man entered, and Merry choked back a cry; for a moment it seemed 
line 39402=>to him that Boromir was alive  again and  had returned. Then he saw  that it 
line 39403=>was not so; the man was a stranger, though as like  to Boromir as if he were 
line 39404=>one of his kin, tall and grey-eyed  and proud. He was clad as a rider with a  
line 39405=>cloak of  dark  green over a coat of fine mail; on the front of his helm was 
line 39406=>wrought  a  small  silver  star.  In  his  hand  he  bore  a  single  arrow, 
line 39407=>black-feathered and barbed with steel, but the point was painted red. 
line 39408=>     He sank on one knee and  presented the  arrow to Thjoden. 'Hail Lord of 
line 39409=>the  Rohirrim, friend  of Gondor!' he said.  'Hirgon I  am,  errand-rider of 
line 39410=>Denethor,  who bring you this token  of  war. Gondor is in great need. Often 
line 39411=>the Rohirrim have  aided us,  but now the  Lord  Denethor asks for  all your 
line 39412=>strength and all your speed; lest Gondor fall at last.' 
line 39413=>     'The  Red  Arrow!' said  Thjoden, holding  it, as  one  who receives  a  
line 39414=>summons  long expected and  yet  dreadful  when it comes. His hand trembled. 
line 39415=>'The Red  Arrow has not been seen in the Mark in all my years! Has it indeed 
line 39416=>come  to that? And what does the Lord Denethor reckon that  all  my strength 
line 39417=>and all my speed may be?' 
line 39418=>     'That is best known  to yourself,  lord,' said Hirgon. 'But ere long it 
line 39419=>may  well come to pass that Minas Tirith is surrounded,  and unless you have 
line 39420=>the strength to  break a siege of many powers, the Lord Denethor bids me say 
line 39421=>that he judges that the  strong arms of the Rohirrim would  be better within 
line 39422=>his walls than without.' 
line 39423=>     'But he knows that we are a people  who fight rather upon horseback and 
line 39424=>in  the open, and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for  
line 39425=>
line 39426=>####-the gathering of our Riders.  Is it not true, Hirgon, that the Lord of Minas 
line 39427=>Tirith knows more than he sets in his message? For we are already at war, as 
line 39428=>you may have seen, and you do not find us all  unprepared. Gandalf the  Grey 
line 39429=>has been among us, and even now we are mustering for battle in the Ea st.' 
line 39430=>     'What  the Lord Denethor may know or guess of all these things I cannot  
line 39431=>say,' answered Hirgon. 'But indeed our  case is desperate. My  lord does not  
line 39432=>issue any command  to  you, he begs  you only to remember old friendship and 
line 39433=>oaths  long spoken, and  for your  own  good to do  all that you may. It  is 
line 39434=>reported to us that many kings have ridden in from the  East  to the service 
line 39435=>of Mordor. From the  North to  the field  of Dagorlad there is skirmish  and 
line 39436=>rumour of war. In the  South the Haradrim are moving, and fear has fallen on 
line 39437=>all our  coastlands, so that little help will come to us thence. Make haste! 
line 39438=>For it is before the walls of Minas Tirith that the doom of our time will be 
line 39439=>decided,  and if the tide be not stemmed there, then  it will flow  over all 
line 39440=>the fair fields of Rohan, and even in this Hold among the hills  there shall 
line 39441=>be no refuge.' 
line 39442=>     'Dark  tidings,'  said Thjoden,  'yet  not  all  unguessed. But say  to 
line 39443=>Denethor that even if Rohan itself felt no peril, still we would come to his 
line 39444=>aid. But we have suffered much loss in our battles with Saruman the traitor, 
line 39445=>and we must  still  think of our frontier to the  north and east, as his own 
line 39446=>tidings make  clear.  So great a power as the  Dark Lord seems  now to wield 
line 39447=>might well  contain us in  battle before the City and yet  strike with great 
line 39448=>force across the River away beyond the Gate of Kings. 
line 39449=>     'But  we  will  speak no longer counsels of prudence. We will come. The 
line 39450=>weapontake was set for the morrow.  When all is ordered we will set out. Ten 
line 39451=>thousand spears I might  have sent  riding over  the plain to the dismay  of 
line 39452=>your foes. It will be less  now, I fear; for I will not leave my strongholds 
line 39453=>all unguarded. Yet six thousands at the  least shall ride behind me. For say 
line 39454=>to Denethor that in this hour the King of the Mark himself will come down to 
line 39455=>the land  of Gondor, though  maybe  he will not ride back. But it is a  long 
line 39456=>road, and man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight. A week it 
line 39457=>may be from tomorrow's morn  ere you hear the cry of the Sons of Eorl coming 
line 39458=>from the North. 
line 39459=>     'A week!' said Hirgon. 'If it must be so, it must. But you are like  to 
line 39460=>find  only  ruined  walls  in  seven  days  from  now,   unless  other  help 
line 39461=>unlooked-for comes. Still, you may at the least disturb the Orcs and Swarthy 
line 39462=>Men from their feasting in the White Tower.' 
line 39463=>
line 39464=>####-     'At the least we will do that,' said Thjoden. 'But I myself am new-come 
line 39465=>from  battle and long  journey, and I will  now go to rest. Tarry here  this 
line 39466=>night. Then you shall  look on the muster of Rohan and ride away the gladder 
line 39467=>for  the sight, and the swifter for the  rest.  In the morning counsels  are 
line 39468=>best, and night changes many thoughts.  
line 39469=>     With  that the king stood up, and they all rose.  'Go  now each to your 
line 39470=>rest.'  he said, 'and  sleep well. And you, Master Meriadoc, I  need no more 
line 39471=>tonight. But be ready to my call as soon as the Sun is risen.' 
line 39472=>     'I will be ready,' said Merry, 'even if you bid me ride with you on the 
line 39473=>Paths of the Dead.' 
line 39474=>     'Speak not words  of omen!' said the k ing. 'For there may be more roads 
line 39475=>than one that could  bear  that name. But I did not say that I would bid you  
line 39476=>ride with me on any road. Good night!' 
line 39477=>     'I won't be left behind,  to be called for on return!'  said  Merry. 'I  
line 39478=>won't be  left, I won't.' And repeating this over and  over again to himself 
line 39479=>he fell asleep at last in his tent. 
line 39480=>     He  was  wakened by  a  man  shaking him.  'Wake up,  wake  up.  Master 
line 39481=>Holbytla!' he cried; and at length Merry came out of  deep dreams and sat up 
line 39482=>with a start. It still seemed very dark, he thought. 
line 39483=>     'What is the matter?' he asked. 
line 39484=>     'The king calls for you.' 
line 39485=>     'But the Sun has not risen, yet,' said Merry. 
line 39486=>     'No, and will not rise  today,  Master Holbytla. Nor  ever  again,  one 
line 39487=>would think under this cloud. But time  does not stand still, though the Sun 
line 39488=>be lost. Make haste!' 
line 39489=>     Flinging on some clothes, Merry looked outside. The world was darkling. 
line 39490=>The very air seemed brown, and  all things  about were  black  and grey  and 
line 39491=>shadowless; there was  a great stillness. No shape  of cloud could be  seen, 
line 39492=>unless it were far away  westward, where the furthest groping fingers of the 
line 39493=>great gloom  still crawled  onwards  and a little light leaked through them. 
line 39494=>Overhead there hung a heavy  roof, sombre and  featureless, and light seemed 
line 39495=>rather to be failing than growing. 
line 39496=>     Merry saw many folk standing, looking up and muttering: all their faces 
line 39497=>were grey and sad, and some  were afraid. With a sinking heart  he made  his 
line 39498=>way to the king. Hirgon the rider of Gondor  was there before him, and beside 
line 39499=>him  stood now another man, like  him and  dressed alike,  but  shorter  and 
line 39500=>broader. As Merry entered he was speaking to the king. 
line 39501=>
line 39502=>####-     'It comes from Mordor,  lord,' he said. 'It began last night at sunset. 
line 39503=>From the hills in the Eastfold of your realm I saw it rise  and creep across 
line 39504=>the sky, and all night as I rode it came behind eating up the stars. Now the 
line 39505=>great cloud hangs  over all  the  land between  here  and  the Mountains  of 
line 39506=>Shadow; and it is deepening. War has a lready begun.' 
line 39507=>     For a while the king sat silent. At last he spoke. 'So we come to it in 
line 39508=>the end,' he said: 'the great battle of our time, in which many things shall 
line 39509=>pass away. But at least there is no longer need for hiding. We will ride the 
line 39510=>straight  way  and  the  open road and with all our  speed. The muster shall 
line 39511=>begin  at once, and wait for none that tarry. Have  you good  store in Minas 
line 39512=>Tirith? For if we must ride now in all haste, then we must  ride light, with 
line 39513=>but meal and water enough to last u s into battle.' 
line 39514=>     'We have very great store long prepared,' answered  Hirgon. Ride now as 
line 39515=>light and as swift as you may!' 
line 39516=>     'Then call  the  heralds,  Jomer,' said  Thjoden. 'Let  the  Riders  be 
line 39517=>marshalled!' 
line 39518=>     Jomer  went out, and presently  the trumpets rang  in the Hold and were 
line 39519=>answered by many others from below; but their voices no longer sounded clear 
line 39520=>and brave as they had seemed to Merry the night before. Dull they seemed and 
line 39521=>harsh in the heavy air, braying ominously. 
line 39522=>     The  king  turned to Merry. 'I am going  to  war,  Master Meriadoc,' he 
line 39523=>said.  'In  a  little while I shall take  the  road.  I release you from  my 
line 39524=>service, but not from my friendship.  You shall abide here, and if you will, 
line 39525=>you shall serve the Lady Jowyn, who will govern the folk in my stead.' 
line 39526=>     'But, but, lord,' Merry  stammered, 'I offered you my sword.  I do  not 
line 39527=>want  to be parted  from you like this, Thjoden King. And as all my  friends 
line 39528=>have gone to the battle' I should be ashamed to stay behind.' 
line 39529=>     'But we ride on horses tall and swift,' said Thjoden; 'and great though 
line 39530=>your heart be, you cannot ride on such beasts.' 
line 39531=>     'Then tie me on  to the back of one,  or let me hang  on a  stirrup, or  
line 39532=>something,' said Merry. 'It  is a long way to  run; but  run  I shall, if  I 
line 39533=>cannot ride, even if I wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late.' 
line 39534=>     Thjoden smiled.  'Rather  than  that  I  would  bear  you  with  me  on 
line 39535=>Snowmane,'  he said. 'But at the least you shall ride with me to  Edoras and 
line 39536=>look on Meduseld;  for that way I  shall go. So far Stybba can bear you: the 
line 39537=>great race will not begin till we reach the plains.' 
line 39538=>     Then Jowyn rose  up. 'Come now,  Meriadoc!' she said. 'I will show  you  
line 39539=>
line 39540=>####-the gear that  I have  prepared  fur  you.' They  went out  together.  'This 
line 39541=>request only did  Aragorn make to me,' said Jowyn, as  they passed among the 
line 39542=>tents, 'that you should be armed for battle. I have  granted it, as I could. 
line 39543=>For my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.' 
line 39544=>     Now she led Merry to a booth among the lodges of the king's  guard  and 
line 39545=>there an armourer brought out to her a  small  helm, and a round shield, and 
line 39546=>other gear. 
line 39547=>     'No mail have we to fit you,' said Jowyn, 'nor any time for the forging 
line 39548=>of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a  
line 39549=>knife. A sword you have.' 
line 39550=>     Merry bowed,  and  the lady showed  him  the shield, which was like the 
line 39551=>shield that had  been given  to Gimli, and  it bore on  it the device of the 
line 39552=>white horse. 'Take  all  these things,' she  said, 'and  bear  them  to good 
line 39553=>fortune! Farewell now, Master  Meriadoc! Yet maybe we  shall meet again, you  
line 39554=>and I.' 
line 39555=>     So  it was that amid a  gathering gloom the King of the Mark made ready 
line 39556=>to lead  all  his  Riders on  the eastward road. Hearts were heavy  and  many 
line 39557=>quailed  in the shadow. But they were  a stern people, loyal to  their lord, 
line 39558=>and  little weeping or  murmuring was heard, even in  the  camp in  the Hold 
line 39559=>where the exiles from Edoras  were housed, women and children  and old  men. 
line 39560=>Doom hung over  them, but they faced it silently. 
line 39561=>     Two  swift hours passed, and now the king  sat  upon  his  white horse, 
line 39562=>glimmering in the half light. Proud and tall he seemed, though the hair that 
line 39563=>flowed beneath his high helm was  like  snow; and  many marvelled a t him and 
line 39564=>took heart to see him unbent and unafraid. 
line 39565=>     There on the wide  flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many 
line 39566=>companies well nigh five and fifty  hundreds of Riders fully armed, and many 
line 39567=>hundreds of other men  with spare  horses lightly burdened. A single trumpet 
line 39568=>sounded. The king raised his  hand, and then silently  the host  of the Mark 
line 39569=>began to  move. Foremost went twelve of the king's household-men,  Riders of 
line 39570=>renown. Then the king followed with Jomer on his right. He had said farewell 
line 39571=>to Jowyn above in  the Hold, and the  memory was grievous; but now he turned 
line 39572=>his mind to the  road that lay ahead. Behind him Merry  rode  on Stybba with 
line 39573=>the errand riders of Gondor, and behind them again twelve more of the king's 
line 39574=>household. They passed  down  the long ranks of  waiting  men with stern  and 
line 39575=>unmoved faces.  But when they had  come  almost  to the end of  the line one 
line 39576=>looked up  glancing  keenly at the hobbit. A young man,  Merry thought as he 
line 39577=>
line 39578=>####-returned the glance, less in height and girth than most. He caught the glint 
line 39579=>of clear grey eyes; and then he  shivered, for  it came suddenly to him that 
line 39580=>it was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death. 
line 39581=>     On  down  the grey road they went beside  the  Snowbourn rushing on its 
line 39582=>stones; through the hamlets of Underharrow and Upbourn, where many sad 
line 39583=>faces 
line 39584=>of women looked out from dark doors; and so without horn or harp or music of 
line 39585=>men's voices the great  ride into the East  began with  which  the songs  of 
line 39586=>Rohan were busy for many long lives of men thereafter. 
line 39587=>     From dark Dunharrow in the dim morning 
line 39588=>     with thane and captain rode Thengel's son: 
line 39589=>     to Edoras he came, the ancient halls 
line 39590=>     of the Mark-wardens mist-enshrouded; 
line 39591=>     golden timbers were in gloom mantled. 
line 39592=>     Farewell he bade to his free people, 
line 39593=>     hearth and high-seat, and the hallowed places, 
line 39594=>     where long he had feasted ere the light faded. 
line 39595=>     Forth rode the king, fear behind him, 
line 39596=>     fate before him. Fealty kept he; 
line 39597=>     oaths he had taken, all fulfilled them. 
line 39598=>     Forth rode Thjoden. Five nights and days 
line 39599=>     east and onward rode the Eorlingas 
line 39600=>     through Folde and Fenmarch and the Firienwood, 
line 39601=>     six thousand spears to Sunlending, 
line 39602=>     Mundburg the mighty under Mindolluin, 
line 39603=>     Sea-kings' city in the South -kingdom 
line 39604=>     foe-beleaguered, fire-encircled. 
line 39605=>     Doom drove them on. Darkness took them, 
line 39606=>     Horse and horseman; hoofbeats afar 
line 39607=>     sank into silence: so the songs tell us. 
line 39608=>     It was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to Edoras, although 
line 39609=>it  was then but noon by the  hour. There  he halted only  a short while and 
line 39610=>strengthened his host by some three  score  of Riders that  came late to the 
line 39611=>weapontake. Now having eaten he made ready to set out  again, and  he wished 
line 39612=>his esquire  a kindly farewell. But Merry begged for the last time not to be 
line 39613=>parted from him. 
line 39614=>     'This is no journey for  such steeds  as  Stybba,  as I have told you ' 
line 39615=>
line 39616=>####-said  Thjoden.  'And  in such a battle as we think to  make on the fields of 
line 39617=>Gondor what  would  you do, Master   Meriadoc, sword-thain though you be, 
line 39618=>and 
line 39619=>greater of heart than of stature?' 
line 39620=>     'As  for that,  who can tell?' answered Merry. 'But why, lord,  did you  
line 39621=>receive me as sword-thain, if not to stay by your side? And I would not have 
line 39622=>it said of me in song only that I was always left behind!' 
line 39623=>     'I  received you for your safe-keeping,' answered Thjoden; 'and also to 
line 39624=>do  as I might bid. None of my Riders can  bear you as burden. If the battle 
line 39625=>were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the 
line 39626=>minstrels; 
line 39627=>but it  is a  hundred leagues and two to Mundburg  where Denethor is lord. I  
line 39628=>will say no more.' 
line 39629=>     Merry  bowed and  went  away  unhappily,  and  stared  at the lines  of 
line 39630=>horsemen. Already the companies were preparing to start: men were tightening 
line 39631=>girths, looking  to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily  at 
line 39632=>the lowering sky. Unnoticed a Rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit's 
line 39633=>ear. 
line 39634=>     'Where will wants not, a way opens, so we say,' he whispered; 'and so I 
line 39635=>have found myself.' Merry looked up and saw that it was the young Rider 
line 39636=>whom 
line 39637=>he had  noticed in the morning. 'You wish to go whither the Lord of the Mark 
line 39638=>goes: I see it in your face.' 
line 39639=>     'I do,' said Merry. 
line 39640=>     'Then you  shall go with me,'  said the Rider. 'I will bear  you before 
line 39641=>me, under my cloak until we are far afield, and this darkness is yet darker. 
line 39642=>Such good will should not be denied. Say no more to any man, but come!' 
line 39643=>     'Thank you indeed!' said Merry. 'Thank you, sir, though I  do not  know 
line 39644=>your name.' 
line 39645=>     'Do you not?' said the Rider softly. 'Then call me Dernhelm.' 
line 39646=>     Thus it  came to pass that  when the  king set out, before Dernhelm sat 
line 39647=>Meriadoc the hobbit, and the great  grey steed  Windfola  made little of the 
line 39648=>burden; for Dernhelm  was  less in  weight than many men, though  lithe  and 
line 39649=>well-knit in frame. 
line 39650=>     On  into the shadow they  rode. In  the willow-thickets where Snowbourn 
line 39651=>flowed into Entwash, twelve leagues east of Edoras,  they camped that night. 
line 39652=>And  then on  again  through the Folde; and through  the  Fenmarch, where to 
line 39653=>
line 39654=>####-their  right great  oakwoods climbed on the skirts of the  hills  under  the 
line 39655=>shades of dark Halifirien by the borders of Gondor; but  away  to their left  
line 39656=>the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of Entwash. And as they  rode 
line 39657=>rumour came of war in the North. Lone men, riding wild, brought word of foes 
line 39658=>assailing their east -borders, of orc-hosts marching in the Wold of Rohan. 
line 39659=>     'Ride on! Ride on!'  cried Jomer. 'Too late now to turn aside. The fens 
line 39660=>of Entwash must guard our flank. Haste now we need. Ride on!' 
line 39661=>     And  so King Thjoden departed from his own realm, and mile  by mile the 
line 39662=>long  road  wound  away,  and  the  beacon  hills  marched  past:  Calenhad, 
line 39663=>Min-Rimmon, Erelas, Nardol. But  their fires  were  quenched. All  the lands 
line 39664=>were grey and still;  and  ever the shadow  deepened before them,  and  hope  
line 39665=>waned in every heart. 
line 39666=>

line 39670=>Chapter 4. The Siege of Gondor 
line 39671=>
line 39672=> 
line 39673=> 
line 39674=>     Pippin was  roused by Gandalf. Candles  were lit in their chamber,  for  
line 39675=>only  a dim  twilight came  through the  windows; the air  was  heavy as with 
line 39676=>approaching thunder. 
line 39677=>     'What is the time?' said Pippin yawning. 
line 39678=>     'Past the second hour,' said Gandalf. 'Time to get up and make yourself 
line 39679=>presentable.  You  are summoned to  the Lord  of the City to learn your  new 
line 39680=>duties.' 
line 39681=>     'And will he provide breakfast?' 
line 39682=>     'No! I have provided  it: all that you will get till noon. Food  is now 
line 39683=>doled out by order.' 
line 39684=>     Pippin  looked  ruefully  at  the  small  loaf  and  (he  thought) very 
line 39685=>inadequate  pat of   butter which was set out for him,  beside  a cup of thin 
line 39686=>milk.  'Why did you bring me here?' he said. 
line 39687=>     'You know quite well,' said Gandalf. 'To keep you out  of mischief; and 
line 39688=>if you do  not  like being here, you can remember  that  you  brought it  on 
line 39689=>yourself.' Pippin said no more. 
line 39690=>     Before  long  he was  walking  with  Gandalf  once  more down  the cold  
line 39691=>corridor to the  door of the Tower Hall. There Denethor sat in a grey gloom,  
line 39692=>like an old patient spider, Pippin  thought: he  did not seem  to have moved 
line 39693=>since the day before. He beckoned Gandalf to a seat, but Pippin was left for  
line 39694=>a while standing unheeded. Presently the old man turned to him: 
line 39695=>     'Well, Master Peregrin,  I hope that you used yesterday to your profit, 
line 39696=>and to your liking? Though  I fear that the board is barer in this city than 
line 39697=>you could wish.' 
line 39698=>     Pippin had  an uncomfortable feeling that most  of what he had said  or  
line 39699=>done was somehow known to the Lord of the City, and much was guessed of 
line 39700=>what 
line 39701=>he thought as well. He did not answer. 
line 39702=>     'What would you do in my service?' 
line 39703=>     'I thought, sir, that you would tell me my duties.' 
line 39704=>     'I will, when I learn what you are fit for,' said Denethor. 'But that I 
line 39705=>shall learn soonest,  maybe,  if  I  keep you beside  me. The esquire of  my 
line 39706=>chamber  has begged leave to  go to the out-garrison, so  you shall take his 
line 39707=>
line 39708=>####-place for a while. You shall wait  on me, bear errands,  and talk to me,  if 
line 39709=>war and council leave me any leisure. Can you sing?' 
line 39710=>     'Yes,' said Pippin.  'Well, yes, well enough for my  own people. But we 
line 39711=>have no songs  fit for  great halls and evil times, lord. We seldom  sing of 
line 39712=>anything more terrible  than wind  or rain. And most  of  my songs are about 
line 39713=>things that make us laugh; or about food and drink, of course.' 
line 39714=>     'And why should such songs be unfit for my halls, or for such  hours as 
line 39715=>these? We who have lived long under the  Shadow may surely listen to  echoes 
line 39716=>from  a land  untroubled  by  it? Then we may  feel that our  vigil was  not 
line 39717=>fruitless, though it may have been thank less.' 
line 39718=>     Pippin's heart sank. He did not  relish the idea of singing any song of 
line 39719=>the Shire to the Lord of Minas Tirith, certainly not the comic  ones that he 
line 39720=>knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an  occasion. He was however 
line 39721=>spared the ordeal  for  the present. He  was not commanded  to sing. Denethor 
line 39722=>turned to Gandalf, asking questions about  the Rohirrim and  their policies,  
line 39723=>and the position of Jomer, the king's nephew. Pippin marvelled at the amount 
line 39724=>that the Lord seemed to  know about a people that  lived far away, though it  
line 39725=>must, he thought, be many years since Denethor himself had ridden abroad. 
line 39726=>     Presently Denethor waved to Pippin and dismissed him again for a while. 
line 39727=>'Go to the armouries of the Citadel,' he said, 'and get you there the livery 
line 39728=>and gear of the  Tower. It will be ready. It was commanded yesterday. Return 
line 39729=>when you are clad!' 
line 39730=>     It was  as he said; and Pippin soon  found himself  arrayed in  strange 
line 39731=>garments, all of black and silver. He  had a small hauberk, its rings forged 
line 39732=>of steel,  maybe,  yet black  as  jet; and a high-crowned  helm  with  small 
line 39733=>raven-wings on  either  side, set with  a  silver star in the centre of  the 
line 39734=>circlet.  Above the mail was a short surcoat  of black, but broidered on the 
line 39735=>breast in silver with the token of the Tree. His old clothes were folded and 
line 39736=>put away, but he was permitted to  keep the grey cloak of Lurien, though not  
line 39737=>to wear it  when  on duty.  He looked now, had he  known it, verily Ernil  i 
line 39738=>Pheriannath , the Prince of  the Halflings, that folk had  called him; but he 
line 39739=>felt uncomfortable. And the gloom began to weigh on his spirits.  
line 39740=>     It  was  dark and dim all day. From the sunless dawn until evening  the 
line 39741=>heavy shadow  had deepened,  and all hearts in the City were oppressed.  Far 
line 39742=>above  a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the Black Land, 
line 39743=>devouring 
line 39744=>light, borne upon a wind of war; but below the air was still and breathless,  
line 39745=>
line 39746=>####-as if all the Vale of Anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm. 
line 39747=>     About  the eleventh hour, released  at  last for  a while from service. 
line 39748=>Pippin came  out and  went  in search  of food and  drink to cheer his heavy 
line 39749=>heart  and make his task of waiting more  supportable. In  the messes he met 
line 39750=>Beregond again, who  had just  come from an errand over the Pelennor  out to 
line 39751=>the Guard-towers upon the Causeway. Together they strolled out to the walls;  
line 39752=>for  Pippin felt imprisoned indoors, and stifled even in the  lofty citadel. 
line 39753=>Now  they sat  side by side again  in the embrasure  looking eastward, where 
line 39754=>they had eaten and talked the day before. 
line 39755=>     It was the sunset-hour, but  the great pall had  now stretched far into 
line 39756=>the  West, and  only  as it sank at last into the Sea did the Sun escape  to 
line 39757=>send  out a brief farewell  gleam before  the night, even as Frodo saw it a t 
line 39758=>the Cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king. But  to  the fields of 
line 39759=>the Pelennor, under the shadow of Mindolluin, there came no gleam: they were 
line 39760=>brown and drear. 
line 39761=>     Already it  seemed years to  Pippin  since he had sat  there before, in 
line 39762=>some half-forgotten time when he had still  been a hobbit,  a  light-hearted 
line 39763=>wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through. Now  he was one 
line 39764=>small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault, clad in the proud but 
line 39765=>sombre manner of the Tower of Guard. 
line 39766=>     In some  other time and place Pippin  might have been pleased with  his 
line 39767=>new array,  but he knew  now  that he was taking part in no  play; he was in 
line 39768=>deadly  earnest the servant of  a grim  master  in the  greatest  peril. The 
line 39769=>hauberk was burdensome, and the helm weighed upon his head. His cloak he 
line 39770=>had 
line 39771=>cast aside  upon the seat. He turned his tired  gaze away from  the darkling 
line 39772=>fields below and yawned, and then he sighed. 
line 39773=>     'You are weary of this day?' said Beregond. 
line 39774=>     'Yes,'  said Pippin,  'very: tired out with idleness and waiting. I have 
line 39775=>kicked my  heels  at the door of my master's  chamber  for many  slow hours, 
line 39776=>while  he  has  debated with Gandalf and the Prince and other great persons.  
line 39777=>And I'm not  used,  Master Beregond, to waiting hungry on others while  they 
line 39778=>eat. It is a sore trial for a hobbit, that. No doubt you will think I should 
line 39779=>feel the honour more  deeply. But  what is the good  of such honour?  Indeed 
line 39780=>what is the  good even of  food  and  drink under this creeping shadow? What 
line 39781=>does it  mean?  The very air seems thick and brown! Do  you often  have such 
line 39782=>glooms when the wind is in the East?' 
line 39783=>
line 39784=>####-     'Nay,'  said  Beregond, 'this is no weather of the world. This  is some 
line 39785=>device  of his  malice; some broil of fume from the Mountain of Fire that he 
line 39786=>sends  to darken hearts and counsel. And so it doth indeed. I wish the  Lord 
line 39787=>Faramir would  return. He  would not be dismayed. But now,  who  knows if he 
line 39788=>will ever come back across the River out of the Darkness?' 
line 39789=>     'Yes,' said Pippin, 'Gandalf, too, is anxious.  He was disappointed.  I 
line 39790=>think, not  to  find Faramir here. And where has he  got to himself? He left 
line 39791=>the  Lord's council before the noon -meal,  and  in  no good  mood either,  I 
line 39792=>thought. Perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news.' 
line 39793=>     Suddenly as they talked  they were  stricken dumb, frozen as it were to 
line 39794=>listening  stones. Pippin cowered down  with his hands pressed to his  ears;  
line 39795=>but Beregond, who  had been  looking out from the battlement  as he spoke of 
line 39796=>Faramir, remained  there, stiffened, staring  out with starting eyes. Pippin 
line 39797=>knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard 
line 39798=>long  ago  in  the Marish  of the Shire, but now it was grown  in  power and 
line 39799=>hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair . 
line 39800=>     At last Beregond spoke with an effort. 'They have come!' he said. 'Take 
line 39801=>courage and look! There are fell things below.' 
line 39802=>     Reluctantly Pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. 
line 39803=>The Pelennor lay dim  beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of 
line 39804=>the  Great  River. But  now  wheeling  swiftly across  it,  like  shadows of 
line 39805=>untimely  night, he  saw in  the middle airs  below him five birdlike forms, 
line 39806=>horrible as carrion-fowl  yet greater than  eagles, cruel as death. Now they 
line 39807=>swooped near, venturing almost within bowshot of the walls, now they circled 
line 39808=>away. 
line 39809=>     'Black Riders!'  muttered Pippin.  'Black  Riders  of the air! But see, 
line 39810=>Beregond!' he cried. 'They are  looking for something, surely? See  how they 
line 39811=>wheel and swoop,  always down to that  point over  there!  And  can  you see 
line 39812=>something moving on the ground? Dark little things. Yes, men on horses: four 
line 39813=>or five. Ah! I cannot stand it! Gandalf! Gandalf save us!' 
line 39814=>     Another  long screech rose and fell,  and  he threw  himself back again 
line 39815=>from the  wall, panting like  a  hunted  animal.  Faint and seemingly remote 
line 39816=>through that shuddering cry he  heard  winding  up from below the sound of a 
line 39817=>trumpet ending on a long high note. 
line 39818=>     'Faramir!  The  Lord Faramir! It is  his call!' cried  Beregond. 'Brave 
line 39819=>heart! But how can he win to the  Gate, if these  foul hell-hawks have other  
line 39820=>weapons than fear? But look! They hold on. They will make the Gate.  No! the 
line 39821=>
line 39822=>####-horses are running mad. Look! the men are thrown; they are running  on foot. 
line 39823=>No,  one is  still  up, but he  rides  back to the others. That will be  the 
line 39824=>Captain: he can master both beasts and men. Ah! there one of the foul things 
line 39825=>is stooping on him. Help! help! Will no one go out to him? Faramir!' 
line 39826=>     With  that Beregond sprang  away  and ran off into the gloom. Ashamed of 
line 39827=>his terror, while Beregond of the Guard thought first of the captain whom he 
line 39828=>loved,  Pippin got up and peered out.  At that  moment he caught  a flash of 
line 39829=>white and silver coming from the  North, like a small star down on the dusky 
line 39830=>fields. It moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came,  converging  
line 39831=>swiftly with  the flight of  the four men  towards the  Gate.  It seemed  to 
line 39832=>Pippin that a  pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way 
line 39833=>before it; and then as  it drew near he thought that he heard, like  an echo 
line 39834=>in the walls, a great voice calling. 
line 39835=>     'Gandalf!' he  cried. 'Gandalf!  He always  turns  up  when things  are 
line 39836=>darkest.  Go on!  Go on,  White Rider! Gandalf, Gandalf!' he shouted wildly, 
line 39837=>like  an  onlooker  at  a  great race urging on a runner who is  far  beyond 
line 39838=>encouragement. 
line 39839=>     But now  the dark  swooping shadows  were  aware  of  the newcomer. One 
line 39840=>wheeled towards  him; but it seemed to Pippin that he raised  his hand,  and 
line 39841=>from  it a  shaft of  white light  stabbed upwards.  The Nazgyl  gave a long 
line 39842=>wailing  cry  and swerved away; and with  that the  four others wavered, and 
line 39843=>then rising in swift spirals they  passed away  eastward  vanishing into the 
line 39844=>lowering cloud  above; and down  on the Pelennor it seemed for a  while less 
line 39845=>dark. 
line 39846=>     Pippin watched,  and he  saw the  horseman and the White Rider meet and 
line 39847=>halt, waiting for those on foot. Men now hurried out to them from the  City;  
line 39848=>and soon they all passed from sight under the  outer walls, and he knew that 
line 39849=>they were  entering the Gate. Guessing  that they would  come at once to the 
line 39850=>Tower and the Steward, he  hurried to the entrance of the citadel.  There he 
line 39851=>was  joined by  many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the 
line 39852=>high walls.  
line 39853=>     It was not long before a clamour  was heard  in the streets leading  up 
line 39854=>from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of  the names 
line 39855=>of Faramir  and Mithrandir. Presently Pippin saw torches, and followed by  a 
line 39856=>press of people two horsemen riding slowly:  one was in white but shining no 
line 39857=>longer, pale in the twilight as if his  fire was spent  or veiled; the other  
line 39858=>was dark  and his  head  was  bowed.  They  dismounted, and  as  grooms took  
line 39859=>
line 39860=>####-Shadowfax and the  other  horse,  they walked forward to the sentinel at the 
line 39861=>gate: Gandalf  steadily,  his  grey  cloak  flung  back,  and  a fire  still 
line 39862=>smouldering in his eyes; the  other,  clad all in green, slowly,  swaying  a  
line 39863=>little as a weary or a wounded man. 
line 39864=>     Pippin pressed  forward  as  they passed  under the  lamp  beneath  the 
line 39865=>gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of Faramir he caught his breath. It  
line 39866=>was the face  of one who has been assailed by a great fear  or anguish,  but 
line 39867=>has  mastered it and now is quiet. Proud and grave he stood for  a moment as 
line 39868=>he spoke to the guard, and Pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled 
line 39869=>his brother  Boromir - whom Pippin had liked from  the  first,  admiring the 
line 39870=>great man's lordly but kindly manner. Yet suddenly for Faramir his heart was 
line 39871=>strangely moved with a feeling that  he had  not known before. Here was  one 
line 39872=>with  an  air of high nobility such as  Aragorn at times revealed, less high 
line 39873=>perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the Kings of Men born 
line 39874=>into a  later time,  but touched with the  wisdom  and sadness of  the Elder  
line 39875=>Race. He knew  now  why Beregond spoke his name with love. He was a  
line 39876=>captain 
line 39877=>that  men would follow, that he would follow, even under  the shadow  of the 
line 39878=>black wings. 
line 39879=>     'Faramir!'  he  cried aloud  with the others.  'Faramir!'  And  Faramir 
line 39880=>catching his strange voice among the clamour  of the men of the City, turned  
line 39881=>and looked down at him and was amazed. 
line 39882=>     'Whence  come  you?'  he said. 'A halfling,  and in the  livery  of the 
line 39883=>Tower! Whence...? ' 
line 39884=>     But  with that Gandalf stepped  to his side and spoke. 'He came with me 
line 39885=>from  the land of the Halflings,' he said. 'He came with  me. But let us not 
line 39886=>tarry here. There is much to say and to do, and you are weary. He shall come 
line 39887=>with  us. Indeed  he  must,  for if he  does not forget his new  duties more 
line 39888=>easily than I do, he must attend on his  lord  again within this hour. Come, 
line 39889=>Pippin, follow us!' 
line 39890=>     So at length they came to the private chamber of the Lord of the  City. 
line 39891=>There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; 
line 39892=>and there Pippin,  hardly noticed, stood behind  the  chair of Denethor  and 
line 39893=>felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said. 
line 39894=>     When Faramir had  taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat 
line 39895=>upon a low chair  at his father's left hand. Removed a little upon the other  
line 39896=>side sat Gandalf in a  chair of  carven  wood; and he seemed  at first to be 
line 39897=>
line 39898=>####-asleep. For at the beginning Faramir spoke only of the errand  upon which he 
line 39899=>had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of Ithilien and of 
line 39900=>movements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the  fight on the road 
line 39901=>when  the  men of Harad  and their  great beast were overthrown:  a  captain 
line 39902=>reporting  to his master  such matters as had often been heard before, small 
line 39903=>things of  border -war that  now seemed useless  and  petty,  shorn of  their 
line 39904=>renown. 
line 39905=>     Then suddenly  Faramir looked at Pippin. 'But now  we  come  to strange  
line 39906=>matters,' he said.  'For this  is not the first  halfling that  I  have seen 
line 39907=>walking out of northern legends into the Southlands.' 
line 39908=>     At that Gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair;  but  he said 
line 39909=>nothing, and  with a look stopped the exclamation on Pippin's lips. Denethor  
line 39910=>looked at their faces  and  nodded his head, as though  in sign  that he had 
line 39911=>read much  there before it  was spoken. Slowly, while the  others sat silent 
line 39912=>and  still,  Faramir  told  his tale, with  his  eyes  for the most part  on 
line 39913=>Gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to Pippin, as if to refresh 
line 39914=>his memory of others that he had seen. 
line 39915=>     As his story was unfolded of his meeting with Frodo and his servant and 
line 39916=>of  the events  at Henneth  Annyn, Pippin became aware that  Gandalf's hands 
line 39917=>were  trembling as they clutched the carven wood. White they seemed now  
line 39918=>and 
line 39919=>very old,  and as  he looked at them,  suddenly with a thrill of fear Pippin 
line 39920=>knew  that Gandalf, Gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid.  The  air of 
line 39921=>the room was close and still. At last when Faramir spoke of his parting with  
line 39922=>the travellers, and of their resolve to go to Cirith Ungol,  his voice fell, 
line 39923=>and he shook his head and sighed. Then Gandalf sprang up. 
line 39924=>     'Cirith Ungol?  Morgul Vale?'  he said. 'The  time,  Faramir, the time?  
line 39925=>When did you part with them? When would they reach that accursed valley?' 
line 39926=>     'I parted with them in  the morning two days ago,' said Faramir. 'It is 
line 39927=>fifteen leagues thence to the vale  of the Morgulduin, if they went straight 
line 39928=>south; and then they would  be  still five leagu es westward of  the accursed 
line 39929=>Tower.  At  swiftest they could not come  there before today, and maybe they 
line 39930=>have not come there yet. Indeed I see what you fear. But the darkness is not 
line 39931=>due to their venture.  It began yestereve, and all Ithilien was under sha dow 
line 39932=>last night.  It is clear to me that the Enemy has long planned an assault on 
line 39933=>us, and its hour had already been determined before ever the travellers left 
line 39934=>my keeping.' 
line 39935=>
line 39936=>####-     Gandalf paced the floor. 'The  morning  of two days ago,  nigh on three 
line 39937=>days of journey! How far is the place where you parted?' 
line 39938=>     'Some  twenty-five leagues as a  bird flies,' answered  Faramir. 'But I 
line 39939=>could not  come more swiftly.  Yestereve I lay at Cair Andros, the long isle 
line 39940=>in the River  northward which we hold in defence; and horses are kept on the 
line 39941=>hither bank. As the dark drew on I  knew that  haste was  needed,  so I rode 
line 39942=>thence with three others that could also be horsed. The rest of my company I  
line 39943=>sent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of Osgiliath. I hope that 
line 39944=>I have not done ill?' He looked at his father. 
line 39945=>     'Ill?' cried Denethor,  and his eyes flashed suddenly. 'Why do you ask? 
line 39946=>The men were under your command. Or do you ask for my  judgement on all 
line 39947=>your 
line 39948=>deeds? Your bearing is lowly in my presence,  yet it is long  now  since you  
line 39949=>turned from your own way at my counsel. See, you have  spoken  skilfully, as 
line 39950=>ever; but  I, have I not seen your  eye fixed on Mithrandir, seeking whether  
line 39951=>you said well or too much? He has long had your heart in his keeping. 
line 39952=>     'My son, your  father is old but not yet dotard. I can see and hear, as 
line 39953=>was  my wont; and  little of what you have half said  or left unsaid  is now 
line 39954=>hidden from me. I know the answer to many riddles. Alas, alas for Boromir!' 
line 39955=>     'If what I have done  displeases you, my father,' said Faramir quietly, 
line 39956=>'I wish I had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement 
line 39957=>was thrust on me.' 
line 39958=>     'Would that have availed to change your judgement?' said Denethor. 'You 
line 39959=>would still have done just so, I deem.  I k now you well. Ever your desire is 
line 39960=>to  appear lordly and generous as  a king of old, gracious, gentle. That may 
line 39961=>well befit one of high race, if he sits in power and peace. But in desperate 
line 39962=>hours gentleness may be repaid with death.' 
line 39963=>     'So be it,' said Faramir. 
line 39964=>     'So  be  it!' cried  Denethor.  'But  not  with your  death  only, Lord 
line 39965=>Faramir: with the death also of your father, and of all your people, whom it 
line 39966=>is your part to protect now that Boromir is gone.' 
line 39967=>     'Do you wish then,' said Faramir, 'that our places had been exchanged?' 
line 39968=>     'Yes,  I wish that indeed,' said Denethor. 'For Boromir was loyal to me 
line 39969=>and no wizard's pupil. He would have remembered his father's need, and would 
line 39970=>not  have squandered what  fortune gave.  He would have brought me  a  mighty 
line 39971=>gift.' 
line 39972=>     For a moment Faramir's restraint gave way. 'I would ask you, my father, 
line 39973=>
line 39974=>####-to remember why it was that I,  not he, was in Ithilien. On  one occasion at 
line 39975=>least your counsel has prevailed, not long ago. It  was the Lord of the City 
line 39976=>that gave the errand to him.' 
line 39977=>     'Stir not the  bitterness in  the cup that  I mixed  for myself,'  said 
line 39978=>Denethor.  'Have I  not tasted it now  many nights upon my tongue foreboding 
line 39979=>that worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find. Would it were not so!  
line 39980=>Would that this thing had come to me!' 
line 39981=>     'Comfort yourself!'  said Gandalf.  'In  no  case  would  Boromir  have 
line 39982=>brought it to you. He is dead, and died well; may he sleep in peace! Yet you  
line 39983=>deceive yourself. He would have stretched out  his hand to this  thing,  and 
line 39984=>taking it he would have fallen. He would have kept it  for his own, and when  
line 39985=>he returned you would not have known your son.' 
line 39986=>     The face of Denethor set  hard and cold. 'You found Boromir less apt to 
line 39987=>your hand, did you not?' he said softly.  'But I who  was his father say that 
line 39988=>he would have  brought it to me.  You are wise,  maybe, Mithrandir, yet with 
line 39989=>all your subtleties you have not all wisdom.  Counsels may be found that are 
line 39990=>neither the  webs  of wizards  nor the haste of fools. I have in this matter 
line 39991=>more lore and wisdom than you deem. ' 
line 39992=>     'What then is your wisdom?' said Gandalf. 
line 39993=>     'Enough to  perceive  that there are two follies to avoid. To  use this 
line 39994=>thing is  perilous. At  this  hour, to send it  in  the hands  of a  witless 
line 39995=>halfling into the land of the Enemy himself, as you  have done, and this son 
line 39996=>of mine, that is madness.' 
line 39997=>     'And the Lord Denethor what would he have done?' 
line 39998=>     'Neither. But most surely  not  for any argument would he have set this 
line 39999=>thing at a hazard beyond all bu t a  fool's hope, risking our utter ruin,  if 
line 40000=>the  Enemy  should  recover what he lost. Nay, it  should  have  been  kept, 
line 40001=>hidden, hidden  dark and deep. Not used, I say, unless  at the uttermost end 
line 40002=>of need, but set beyond his grasp, save by a victory so  final that what then 
line 40003=>befell would not trouble us, being dead.' 
line 40004=>     'You  think,  as  is your wont, my lord, of Gondor only,' said Gandalf. 
line 40005=>'Yet there are other men and other lives, and time still to be.  And for me, 
line 40006=>I pity even his slaves.' 
line 40007=>     'And wher e  will other  men look for help, if  Gondor  falls?' answered 
line 40008=>Denethor. 'If I had this thing  now in  the deep  vaults of this citadel, we 
line 40009=>should not then  shake with  dread  under this gloom, fearing the worst, and 
line 40010=>our counsels would  be  undisturbed. If you do not trust  me  to endure  the 
line 40011=>
line 40012=>####-test, you do not know me yet.' 
line 40013=>     'Nonetheless I do not trust you,' said Gandalf. 'Had I done so, I could 
line 40014=>have sent this thing hither to  your keeping  and  spared myself and  others 
line 40015=>much  anguish.  And now hearing  you speak  I trust you  less, no  more than 
line 40016=>Boromir. Nay, stay your wrath! I do  not trust myself in this, and I refused 
line 40017=>this thing, even as  a  freely given gift. You  are strong and can still  in 
line 40018=>some matters govern  yourself, Denethor; yet if you had received this thing,  
line 40019=>it  would  have  overthrown  you.  Were  it  buried  beneath  the  roots  of 
line 40020=>Mindolluin, still it would burn  your mind away, as the darkness grows,  and 
line 40021=>the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us.' 
line 40022=>     For a moment the eyes of Denethor glowed again as he faced Gandalf, and 
line 40023=>Pippin felt  once  more the  strain between  their wills;  but now almost it 
line 40024=>seemed  as if their glances were like blades  from eye to eye, flickering as 
line 40025=>they  fenced. Pippin trembled fearing  some  dreadful  stroke.  But suddenly  
line 40026=>Denethor relaxed and grew cold again. He shrugged his shoulders.  
line 40027=>     'If I had! If you had!' he said. 'Such words and ifs are  vain.  It has 
line 40028=>gone into the Shadow, and only time will show  what  doom awaits it  and us.  
line 40029=>The time will not  be long. In what is left, let all who fight  the Enemy in 
line 40030=>their fashion be at one, and keep hope while they may, and after hope  still 
line 40031=>the hardihood to die  free.' He turned to  Faramir.  'What think  you of the 
line 40032=>garrison at Osgiliath?' 
line 40033=>     'It is not strong,'  said Faramir. 'I have sent the company of Ithilien 
line 40034=>to strengthen it, as I have said.' 
line 40035=>     'Not enough, I deem,' said Denethor. 'It is  there that the first  blow 
line 40036=>will fall. They will have need of some stout captain there.' 
line 40037=>     'There  and  elsewhere  in many places,' said Faramir, and sighed. 'Alas 
line 40038=>for my brother, whom I too loved!' He rose. 'May I have your leave, father?' 
line 40039=>And then he swayed and leaned upon his father's chair. 
line 40040=>     'You are weary, I see,' said Denethor.  'You  have ridden  fast and far, 
line 40041=>and under shadows of evil in the air, I am told.' 
line 40042=>     'Let us not speak of that!' said Faramir. 
line 40043=>     'Then  we  will  not,'  said  Denethor. 'Go  now and  rest as you  may. 
line 40044=>Tomorrow's need will be sterner.' 
line 40045=>     All now took leave of the Lor d of the City and went to rest  while they 
line 40046=>still could.  Outside there  was a starless blackness as Gandalf with Pippin 
line 40047=>beside  him bearing a small torch, made  his way to their  lodging. They did  
line 40048=>not speak until they were behind closed  doors. Then  at  last  Pippin  took  
line 40049=>
line 40050=>####-Gandalf's hand. 
line 40051=>     'Tell me,' he  said, 'is there any hope? For Frodo, I mean; or at least 
line 40052=>mostly for Frodo.' 
line 40053=>     Gandalf put his hand on Pippin's head. 'There never was much  hope,' he 
line 40054=>answered.  'Just a  fool's hope,  as  I have  been told. And when I heard of 
line 40055=>Cirith Ungol------' He broke  off and  strode to  the window as if his  eyes 
line 40056=>could pierce the night  in the East. 'Cirith Ungol!' he  muttered. 'Why that 
line 40057=>way, I wonder?' He turned.  'Just now, Pippin,  my heart almost  failed  me, 
line 40058=>hearing that name.  And yet  in truth  I believe that  the news that Faramir 
line 40059=>brings has some hope in it. For it seems clear that our Enemy has opened his 
line 40060=>war at last and made the first  move while Frodo was still free. So  now for  
line 40061=>many days  he will have his eye turned this way and that, away  from his own 
line 40062=>land. And yet, Pippin, I  feel from afar his haste and  fear.  He  has begun 
line 40063=>sooner than he would. Something has happened to stir him.' 
line 40064=>     Gandalf  stood for a moment in thought.  'Maybe,'  he  muttered.  'Maybe 
line 40065=>even your foolishness helped,  my lad. Let me see: some five days ago now he 
line 40066=>would discover that  we had thrown  down  Saruman and had  taken the  Stone. 
line 40067=>Still  what of that?  We could  not use it to much  purpose, or without  his 
line 40068=>knowing. Ah! I wonder. Aragorn? His time  draws  near. And he  is strong and 
line 40069=>stern underneath, Pippin; bold, determined, able to take his own counsel and 
line 40070=>dare great risks  at  need. That may be it. He may have used  the  Stone and 
line 40071=>shown  himself  to the  Enemy,  challenging  him, for  this very purpose.  I 
line 40072=>wonder. Well, we shall not know the answer till the Riders of Rohan come, if 
line 40073=>they do not come  too  late.  There are evil days ahead.  To sleep  while we 
line 40074=>may!' 
line 40075=>     'But,' said Pippin. 
line 40076=>     'But what?' said Gandalf. 'Only one but will I allow tonight.' 
line 40077=>     'Gollum,' said  Pippin. 'How  on  earth could they  be going about with 
line 40078=>him, even following him? And I could see that Faramir did not like the place  
line 40079=>he was taking them to any more than you do. What is wrong?' 
line 40080=>     'I cannot answer  that now,' said Gandalf. 'Yet  my heart guessed  that 
line 40081=>Frodo and Gollum  would  meet  before the end. For good, or for evil. But of 
line 40082=>Cirith  Ungol  I  will  not speak  tonight.  Treachery,  treachery  I  fear; 
line 40083=>treachery  of  that  miserable creature. But so it must be. Let us  remember  
line 40084=>that a traitor may betray himself and  do good that he does not  intend.  It 
line 40085=>can be so, sometimes. Good night! ' 
line 40086=>     The next day came with a morning like  a brown  dusk, and the hearts of 
line 40087=>
line 40088=>####-men, lifted for a while by the return of Faramir, sank low again. The winged 
line 40089=>Shadows were  not  seen again  that day,  yet  ever and anon, high above the 
line 40090=>city, a faint cry would come,  and  many who heard  it  would stand stricken 
line 40091=>with a passing dread, while the less stout-hearted quailed and wept. 
line 40092=>     And now Faramir was gone again. 'They give him no rest,' some murmured. 
line 40093=>'The Lord drives his son too hard, and  now he must do the duty of  two, for  
line 40094=>himself  and  for  the  one that  will  not return.'  And  ever  men  looked 
line 40095=>northward, asking: 'Where are the Riders of Rohan?' 
line 40096=>     In truth Faramir did not  go  by  his own choosing. But the Lord of the 
line 40097=>City  was master of his  Council,  and he was in no mood that day  to bow to 
line 40098=>others. Early in the morning the  Council had been summoned.  There  all the 
line 40099=>captains judged that because of the threat in the South their force  was too 
line 40100=>weak  to  make any stroke of  war on  their own part,  unless perchance  the 
line 40101=>Riders of Rohan yet should come. Meanwhile they must man the walls and 
line 40102=>wait. 
line 40103=>     'Yet,'  said  Denethor,  'we  should  not  lightly  abandon  the  outer  
line 40104=>defences,  the Rammas made with so  great  a  labour. And the Enemy must 
line 40105=>pay 
line 40106=>dearly for the crossing of the River. That he cannot do, in  force to assail 
line 40107=>the City, either north of Cair Andros because of  the marshes, or southwards 
line 40108=>towards Lebennin because of the breadth of the River, that needs many boats.  
line 40109=>It  is at  Osgiliath that he  will  put his weight, as before  when  Boromir 
line 40110=>denied him the passage.' 
line 40111=>     'That was but a trial,' said Faramir. 'Today we may make  the Enemy pay 
line 40112=>ten times our  loss at  the passage and yet  rue  the  exchange.  For he can 
line 40113=>afford  to lose a host better  than we to lose a company. And the retreat of 
line 40114=>those  that we  put out  far afield  will  be per ilous, if he wins across in 
line 40115=>force.' 
line 40116=>     'And what of Cair Andros?' said the Prince. 'That, too, must  be  held, 
line 40117=>if Osgiliath  is defended.  Let  us  not forget  the danger on our left. The 
line 40118=>Rohirrim may  come,  and  they may not. But  Faramir  has  told us  of great 
line 40119=>strength drawing ever  to the Black Gate. More than  one host may issue from 
line 40120=>it, and strike for more than one passage.' 
line 40121=>     'Much must be risked in war,' said Denethor. 'Cair Andros is manned and  
line 40122=>no more  can be sent so far. But I will not yield the River and the Pelennor  
line 40123=>unfought  - not if there  is a captain  here who has still the courage to do 
line 40124=>his lord's will.' 
line 40125=>
line 40126=>####-     Then all were silent, but at length Faramir said: 'I do not oppose your 
line 40127=>will, sire. Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will go and do what  I can in 
line 40128=>his stead  - if you command it.' 
line 40129=>     'I do so,' said Denethor. 
line 40130=>     'Then farewell!' said Faramir. 'But if I should return, think better of 
line 40131=>me!' 
line 40132=>     'That depends on the manner of your return,' said Denethor. 
line 40133=>     Gandalf it was that  last spoke  to Faramir ere he  rode east. 'Do  not 
line 40134=>throw your live away rashly or in bitterness,' he said. 'You  will be needed 
line 40135=>here,  for other things  than war. Your  father loves you, Faramir, and will 
line 40136=>remember it ere the end. Farewell!' 
line 40137=>     So now the Lord Faramir had gone  forth again, and had taken  with  him 
line 40138=>such strength of men as were willing to go  or could be spared. On the walls 
line 40139=>some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city, and they wondered 
line 40140=>what 
line 40141=>chanced there, for nothing could be seen.  And others, as ever, looked north 
line 40142=>and counted the leagues to Thjoden in Rohan. 'Will he come? Will he 
line 40143=>remember  
line 40144=>our old alliance?' they said. 
line 40145=>     'Yes, he will  come,'  said  Gandalf, 'even  if  he comes too late. But 
line 40146=>think! At best the Red Arrow cannot have reached him more than two days 
line 40147=>ago, 
line 40148=>and the miles are long from Edoras.' 
line 40149=>     It was night again ere news came. A  man rode in  haste from the fords, 
line 40150=>saying that a host had issued from Minas Morgul and was already drawing nigh 
line 40151=>to Osgiliath; and it had been joined  by regiments from the South, Haradrim, 
line 40152=>cruel and tall. 'And we have learned ' said the messenger, 'that  the  Black  
line 40153=>Captain  leads  them once again,  and the fear of him  has passed before him 
line 40154=>over the River.' 
line 40155=>     With those ill-boding words the third day closed since  Pippin came  to 
line 40156=>Minas Tirith. Few went to rest, for small hope had any now that even Faramir 
line 40157=>could hold the fords for long. 
line 40158=>     The next day,  though the darkness  had reached  its  full and grew  no 
line 40159=>deeper, it weighed heavier  on men's  hearts, and a great dread was on them.  
line 40160=>Ill  news came soon  again.  The  passage of  Anduin was won  by  the Enemy. 
line 40161=>Faramir was retreating to the wall of  the Pelennor, rallying his men to the 
line 40162=>Causeway Forts; but he was ten times outnumbered. 
line 40163=>
line 40164=>####-     'If he wins back at all across the Pelennor, his enemies will be on his 
line 40165=>heels,' said  the messenger. 'They have paid dear for the  crossing but less 
line 40166=>dearly than we  hoped.  The plan has been well laid. It is now  seen that in 
line 40167=>secret  they have long been building  floats and barges in great numbers  in 
line 40168=>East  Osgiliath.  They  swarmed across  like  beetles.  But  it is the Black  
line 40169=>Captain  that  defeats us. Few  will stand and abide even the  rumour of his 
line 40170=>coming.  His own folk quail at him,  and they would  slay themselves  at his 
line 40171=>bidding.' 
line 40172=>     'Then I am needed  there more than here,' said Gandalf, and rode off at 
line 40173=>once,  and the glimmer  of him  faded soon  from  sight. And  all that night 
line 40174=>Pippin alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward. 
line 40175=>     The bells  of  day had  scarcely  rung  out again,  a  mockery  in  the 
line 40176=>unlightened dark, when  far  away he saw  fires spring up, across in the dim 
line 40177=>spaces where the walls of the Pelennor stood. The  watchmen cried aloud, and 
line 40178=>all men in the City stood to arms. Now ever and anon there was a  red flash,  
line 40179=>and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard. 
line 40180=>     'They have taken the wall!' men cried. 'They are blasting  breaches  in 
line 40181=>it. They are coming!' 
line 40182=>     'Where  is Faramir?'  cried  Beregond in dismay.  'Say not  that he has 
line 40183=>fallen!' 
line 40184=>     It was  Gandalf that  brought the  first  tidings.  With  a  handful of 
line 40185=>horsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line of wains.  
line 40186=>They were filled with wounded men, all that could be sa ved from the wreck of 
line 40187=>the Causeway Forts. At  once he went  to Denethor.  The Lord of the City sat 
line 40188=>now in a high chamber above the Hall of the White Tower  with Pippin  at his 
line 40189=>side;  and through  the dim windows, north and  south and east,  he bent his 
line 40190=>dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that  ringed him  round. Most  
line 40191=>to the north  he looked, and would  pause at whiles to listen as  if by some 
line 40192=>ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away. 
line 40193=>     'Is Faramir come?' he a sked. 
line 40194=>     'No,' said Gandalf.  'But he still  lived when I  left him. Yet  he  is 
line 40195=>resolved  to stay  with the rearguard,  lest  the retreat over  the Pelennor  
line 40196=>become a rout.  He may,  perhaps, hold  his men  together long enough, but I  
line 40197=>doubt it.  He  is  pitted against a foe too great.  For one has come  that I 
line 40198=>feared.' 
line 40199=>     'Not -  the  Dark  Lord?'  cried Pippin, forgetting  his place  in  his 
line 40200=>terror. 
line 40201=>
line 40202=>####-     Denethor laughed bitterly. 'Nay, not  yet, Master Peregrin! He will not 
line 40203=>come save  only to triumph over me when all is  won. He uses  others as  his 
line 40204=>weapons. So do  all great lords, if they  are wise,  Master Halfling. Or why 
line 40205=>should I sit here in  my tower and think, and watch, and wait, spending even 
line 40206=>my sons? For I can still wield a brand.' 
line 40207=>     He stood up and cast open his long black cloak, and behold! he was clad 
line 40208=>in mail beneath,  and girt  with a  long sword, great-hilted in a sheath  of 
line 40209=>black and silver. 'Thus have I walked, and thus  now  for many years  have I  
line 40210=>slept,' he said, 'lest with age the body should grow soft and timid.' 
line 40211=>     'Yet now under the Lord of Barad-dyr the most  fell of all his captains 
line 40212=>is already master of your outer  walls,'  said Gandalf. 'King of Angmar long 
line 40213=>ago, Sorcerer, Ringwraith, Lord of the Nazgyl, a spear of terror in the hand 
line 40214=>of Sauron, shadow of despair.' 
line 40215=>     'Then, Mithrandir, you  had a  foe to  match you,'  said Denethor. 'For  
line 40216=>myself, I  have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the Dark 
line 40217=>Tower. Is this all that you have returned to say? Or can it be that you have 
line 40218=>withdrawn because you are overmatched?' 
line 40219=>     Pippin  trembled, fearing  that Gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath, 
line 40220=>but his fear was needless.  'It  might be so,' Gandalf answered softly. 'But 
line 40221=>our trial of strength is not yet come. And if words  spoken  of old be true, 
line 40222=>not by the hand of man  shall he fall, and hidden from the Wise  is the doom 
line 40223=>that awaits him.  However that may be, the Captain of Despair does not press 
line 40224=>forward,  yet.  He rules rather according to  the  wisdom that you have just 
line 40225=>spoken, from the rear, driving his slaves in madness on before. 
line 40226=>     'Nay, I came  rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be  healed; for 
line 40227=>the Rammas is  breached far and wide, and soon the host of Morgul will enter  
line 40228=>in at many points. And I came chiefly to say this. Soon there will be battle 
line 40229=>on  the  fields. A sortie must be made  ready.  Let it be of mounted men. In 
line 40230=>them lies our  brief hope, for in one thing only is  the enemy  still poorly 
line 40231=>provided: he has few horsemen.' 
line 40232=>     'And we also have few. Now  would the coming of Rohan be in the nick of 
line 40233=>time,' said Denethor. 
line 40234=>     'We are likely to see other newcomers first,' said  Gandalf. 'Fugitives 
line 40235=>from Cair Andros have  already reached us. The isle has fallen. Another army 
line 40236=>is come from the Black Gate, crossing from the north-east.' 
line 40237=>     'Some have accused  you, Mithrandir,  of  delighting to bear ill news,' 
line 40238=>said Denethor, 'but to  me  this is  no longer news: it  was known to mw ere 
line 40239=>
line 40240=>####-nightfall yesterday. As for the sortie,  I had already given thought to  it. 
line 40241=>Let us go down.' 
line 40242=>     Time  passed. At length watchers on the walls could  see the retreat of 
line 40243=>the  out-companies. Small bands of weary  and  often wounded  men came first  
line 40244=>with  little  order; some  were running wildly  as if  pursued. Away to  the 
line 40245=>ea stward the distant fires flickered; and  now it seemed that here and there 
line 40246=>they crept across the plain. Houses and barns were burning.  Then from  many 
line 40247=>points little  rivers of red flame  came  hurrying on,  winding through  the 
line 40248=>gloom,  converging  towards   the line of  the broad  road that  led from the 
line 40249=>City-gate to Osgiliath. 
line 40250=>     'The enemy,' men  murmured. 'The  dike is  down. Here they come pouring 
line 40251=>through the  breaches! And they carry  torches,  it seems. Where are our own 
line 40252=>folk?' 
line 40253=>     It drew now to evening by the hour, and  the light was so dim that even 
line 40254=>far-sighted men upon the  Citadel could  discern little clearly out upon the 
line 40255=>fields, save only the  burnings that ever multiplied, and the lines  of fire 
line 40256=>that grew in length and speed.  At last, less than a mile  from  the City, a  
line 40257=>more ordered mass of men came into view, marching not running, still holding 
line 40258=>together. 
line 40259=>     The watchers held their breath. 'Faramir must be there,' they said. 'He 
line 40260=>can govern man and beast. He will make it yet.' 
line 40261=>     Now  the  main retreat  was scarcely  two furlongs distant. Out of  the 
line 40262=>gloom behind a small company of horsemen galloped, all that was  left of the 
line 40263=>rearguard. Once again they turned at bay, facing the oncoming lines of fire. 
line 40264=>Then  suddenly  there was a tumult of   fierce cries. Horsemen of  the  enemy  
line 40265=>swept up. The lines of fire became flowing torrents,  file upon file of Orcs 
line 40266=>bearing flames, and wild Southron men with red banners, shouting with  harsh 
line 40267=>tongues, surging up, overtaking the retreat. And with a  piercing cry out of 
line 40268=>the dim sky fell the winged shadows, the Nazgyl stooping to the kill. 
line 40269=>     The retreat became a rout. Already men were breaking away, flying  wild  
line 40270=>and witless here and there, flinging away their weapons, crying out in fear, 
line 40271=>falling to the ground. 
line 40272=>     And then a trumpet rang from the Citadel, and Denethor at last released 
line 40273=>the sortie. Drawn up  within  the shadow of the  Gate and under the  looming 
line 40274=>walls outside they had waited for his signal: all the  mounted men that were 
line 40275=>left in the City.  Now they  sprang forward, formed, quickened to  a gallop, 
line 40276=>and charged with a great shout. And  from the walls an answering  shout went 
line 40277=>
line 40278=>####-up; for foremost on the field rode the swan-knights of Dol Amroth with their  
line 40279=>Prince and his blue banner at their head. 
line 40280=>     'Amroth for Gondor!' they cried. 'Amroth to Faramir!' 
line 40281=>     Like thunder they broke  upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat; 
line 40282=>but  one rider outran  them  all, swift as the  wind in the grass: Shadowfax 
line 40283=>bore him, shining,  unveiled  once  more, a light starting from his upraised 
line 40284=>hand. 
line 40285=>     The Nazgyl screeched and swept away, for their Captain was not yet come 
line 40286=>to challenge the  white fire of his foe. The hosts of Morgul intent on their 
line 40287=>prey,  taken at  unawares in wild career, broke, scattering like sparks in a  
line 40288=>gale. The out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their  pursuers.  
line 40289=>Hunters  became the hunted. The retreat  became  an onslaught. The field was 
line 40290=>strewn with stricken orcs and  men, and a  reek arose of torches cast  away, 
line 40291=>sputtering ou t in swirling smoke. The cavalry rode on. 
line 40292=>     But  Denethor  did not  permit them to  go  far.  Though the enemy  was 
line 40293=>checked, and for the moment driven back, great forces  were flowing  in from 
line 40294=>the East.  Again  the  trumpet rang,  sounding the retreat.  The cavalry  of 
line 40295=>Gondor halted. Behind their screen the out-companies re-formed. Now steadily 
line 40296=>they  came marching  back. They  reached the  Gate  of the City and entered,  
line 40297=>stepping  proudly:  and  proudly the people of the  City looked  on them and 
line 40298=>cried their praise, and  yet they were troubled in heart. For the  companies 
line 40299=>were grievously reduced. Faramir had lost a third of his men. And  where was 
line 40300=>he? 
line 40301=>     Last of all he came. His men passed in. The  mounted knights  returned, 
line 40302=>and at their rear  the banner  of Dol Amroth, and the Prince. And in his arms 
line 40303=>before him on  his  horse  he bore  the body of his kinsman, Faramir  son of 
line 40304=>Denethor, found upon the stricken field. 
line 40305=>     'Faramir! Faramir!' men cried, weeping in the  streets.  But he did not 
line 40306=>answer, and they  bore him away up the winding  road to the Citadel  and his 
line 40307=>father. Even  as the Nazgyl had swerved aside  from the  onset of  the White 
line 40308=>Rider,  there came flying a deadly dart, and Faramir,  as he  held at bay  a  
line 40309=>mounted champion of Harad, had  fallen to the earth.  Only the charge of Dol 
line 40310=>Amroth had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed 
line 40311=>him 
line 40312=>as he lay. 
line 40313=>     The Prince Imrahil brought  Faramir to  the White Tower, and  he  said: 
line 40314=>Your son has returned, lord, after  great deeds, and he told all that he had 
line 40315=>
line 40316=>####-seen. But Denethor rose  and looked on the face  of his  son and was silent. 
line 40317=>Then he  bade  them make a bed  in the  chamber and lay Faramir  upon it and 
line 40318=>depart. But  he himself went up alone into the  secret room under the summit 
line 40319=>of the Tower; and many who looked  up thither  at that time saw a pale light  
line 40320=>that gleamed and  flickered from the  narrow  windows for a while,  and then 
line 40321=>flashed and  went  out. And when Denethor descended again he went to 
line 40322=>Faramir 
line 40323=>and sat beside him withou t speaking, but the face of the Lord was grey, more 
line 40324=>deathlike than his son's.  
line 40325=>     So now at last the  City was besieged, enclosed in a ring  of foes. The 
line 40326=>Rammas  was broken, and all the Pelennor  abandoned  to the Enemy.  The last  
line 40327=>word  to  come  from outside the  walls  was  brought by men flying down the 
line 40328=>northward road ere the  Gate was  shut. They were the remnant of  the  guard 
line 40329=>that was kept  at that point where the way from Anurien and  Rohan  ran into 
line 40330=>the townlands: Ingold led them, the same who had admitted Gandalf and Pippin 
line 40331=>less than five days before,  while the sun still rose and there was hope  in 
line 40332=>the morning. 
line 40333=>     'There is no  news of the Rohirrim,' he said. 'Rohan will not come now.  
line 40334=>Or if they come, it will not avail us. The new host that we had  tidings  of 
line 40335=>has come first, from over  the River by way of Andros, it is said.  They are 
line 40336=>strong: battalions of Orcs of the Eye, and  countless companies of Men of  a  
line 40337=>new sort that  we have not met before. Not tall, but broad and grim, bearded 
line 40338=>like dwarves, wielding great axes. Out of some savage land in the  wide East  
line 40339=>they come, we  deem. They hold  the northward road; and  many have passed 
line 40340=>on 
line 40341=>into Anurien. The Rohirrim cannot come.' 
line 40342=>     The Gate was shut. All night watchmen on the  walls heard the rumour of 
line 40343=>the enemy that roamed outside,  burning field  and tree, and  hewing any man 
line 40344=>that they found abroad, living or  dead. The numbers that had already passed  
line 40345=>over the River  could not be guessed  in the darkness, but when  morning, or  
line 40346=>its  dim shadow,  stole over the plain, it was seen that  even fear by night 
line 40347=>had  scarcely over -counted them.  The plain was  dark  with  their  marching 
line 40348=>companies, and as far as eyes could strain in the  mirk there sprouted, like 
line 40349=>a  foul fungus-growth, all about the beleaguered  city great camps of tents, 
line 40350=>black or sombre red. 
line 40351=>     Busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging, digging lines of deep trenches 
line 40352=>in a huge ring, just out of bowshot from the walls; and as the trenches were 
line 40353=>
line 40354=>####-made each was filled with fire, though how it was  kindled or fed, by art or  
line 40355=>devilry, none could see.  All day the labour  went forward, while the men of 
line 40356=>Minas Tirith  looked  on, unable to hinder it. And as each  length of trench 
line 40357=>was  completed,  they  could see great wains approaching; and soon yet  more 
line 40358=>companies of the enemy were swiftly setting up, each behind  the cover of  a  
line 40359=>trench, great engines for the casting of missiles. There were  none upon the 
line 40360=>City walls large enough to reach so far or to stay the work. 
line 40361=>     At  first  men laughed and did   not greatly fear  such devices. For the 
line 40362=>main  wall of  the City was of great height and  marvellous thickness, built 
line 40363=>ere the power and craft of N®menor waned in exile; and its outward  face was 
line 40364=>like  to the Tower  of  Orthanc,  hard and dark and smooth, unconquerable by 
line 40365=>steel or  fire, unbreakable except  by some  convulsion that would rend  the 
line 40366=>very earth on which it stood. 
line 40367=>     'Nay,'  they said,  'not if  the Nameless One himself should come,  not 
line 40368=>even he could enter here while  we yet live.'  But some answered: 'While  we 
line 40369=>yet live? How long? He has  a weapon that has brought low many strong places 
line 40370=>since the world began. Hunger. The roads are cut. Rohan will not come.' 
line 40371=>     But the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall. It was no 
line 40372=>brigand or orc-chieftain that ordered the assault upon the Lord  of Mordor's 
line 40373=>greatest  foe. A  power and mind of malice guided  it. As soon as  the great 
line 40374=>catapults were set, with many yells and the creaking of rope and winch, they 
line 40375=>began to throw  missiles marvellou sly high, so that they passed  right above 
line 40376=>the  battlement and fell thudding  within the first circle of  the City; and 
line 40377=>many of them by some secret art burst into flame as they came toppling down. 
line 40378=>     Soon there  was great peril of fire behind the wall,  and all who could 
line 40379=>be spared  were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many places. Then 
line 40380=>among the greater casts  there  fell  another hail, less  ruinous  but  more 
line 40381=>horrible. All about the streets and lanes behind the Gate  it tumbled  down, 
line 40382=>small round shot that did not burn. But when men ran  to learn what it might  
line 40383=>be, they cried aloud or wept.  For the enemy was flinging into  the City all 
line 40384=>the heads of  those who had  fallen fighting at Osgiliath, or on the Rammas,  
line 40385=>or  in the fields. They were grim to look on; for though some  were  crushed 
line 40386=>and shapeless, and some had  been cruelly hewn, yet  many had  features that 
line 40387=>could be told,  and  it  seemed that  they  had  died in pain;  and all were 
line 40388=>branded with  the foul token of the Lidless Eye. But marred  and dishonoured 
line 40389=>as  they were, it often chanced  that thus a man would see again the face of 
line 40390=>someone  that he had known, who had  walked proudly once in arms,  or tilled 
line 40391=>
line 40392=>####-the fields, or ridden in upon a holiday from the green vales in the hills.  
line 40393=>     In vain men shook  their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before 
line 40394=>the Gate. Curses they heeded not, nor understood the tongues of western men; 
line 40395=>crying with harsh voices like beasts and  carrion-birds. But soon there were 
line 40396=>few left in Minas Tirith who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of 
line 40397=>Mordor.  For yet another weapon, swifter than hunger,  the Lord of the  Dark 
line 40398=>Tower had: dread and despair. 
line 40399=>     The Nazgyl came again, and  as  their  Dark Lord now grew and put forth  
line 40400=>his strength, so their voices, which uttered only his  will and  his malice, 
line 40401=>were filled with  evil and  horror. Ever they circled  above the  City, like 
line 40402=>vultures that expect their fill of doomed men's flesh. Out of sight and shot 
line 40403=>they  flew, and yet were ever present, and their deadly voices rent the air. 
line 40404=>More unbearable they became, not  less, at each new cry.  At length even the 
line 40405=>stout-hearted would  fling  themselves to the  ground as the  hidden  menace 
line 40406=>passed  over  them,  or they would  stand, letting  their  weapons fall from 
line 40407=>nerveless hands while into their minds a blackness came, and they thought no 
line 40408=>more of war, but only of hiding and of crawling, and of death. 
line 40409=>     During all this black day Faramir  lay  upon his bed  in the chamber of 
line 40410=>the White Tower, wandering  in  a  desperate fever; dying someone  said, and 
line 40411=>soon  'dying' all men were saying upon  the walls and in the streets. And by 
line 40412=>him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave  no  longer  any 
line 40413=>heed to the defence. 
line 40414=>     No  hours  so dark had  Pippin known, not  even in the clutches  of the 
line 40415=>Uruk-hai. It was  his duty to wait upon the Lord, and wait he did, forgotten 
line 40416=>it seemed, standing by  the  door of the unlit  chamber, mastering  his  own 
line 40417=>fears as best he could. And as  he  watched, it seemed to him that  Denethor  
line 40418=>grew old before his eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and 
line 40419=>his stern mind was  overthrown. Grief maybe had wrought it, and  remorse. He 
line 40420=>saw tears on that once tearless face, more unbearable than wrath. 
line 40421=>     'Do not weep, lord,' he stammered. 'Perhaps he will get well. Have  you  
line 40422=>asked Gandalf?' 
line 40423=>     'Comfort me  not  with wizards!' said Denethor.  'The  fool's  hope has 
line 40424=>failed.  The Enemy has  found it, and now his power waxes; he sees  our very 
line 40425=>thoughts, and all we do is ruinous. 
line 40426=>     'I sent my  son forth,  unthanked, unblessed, out  into needless peril, 
line 40427=>and here he lies with poison in his veins. Nay, nay, whatever may now betide 
line 40428=>in war, my line too is  ending, even the House  of the Stewards  has failed. 
line 40429=>
line 40430=>####-Mean  folk shall rule  the last remnant of the Kings of Men, lurking in  the 
line 40431=>hills until all are hounded out.' 
line 40432=>     Men came to the  door crying for the Lord of the City. 'Nay, I will not 
line 40433=>come down,' he said. 'I must stay beside my son. He might still speak before 
line 40434=>the end. But that is near. Follow whom you will,  even the Grey Fool, though 
line 40435=>his hope has failed. Here I stay.' 
line 40436=>     So it was that Gandalf took command of the last defence of the City  of 
line 40437=>Gondor.  Wherever he came  men's  hearts would  lift  again,  and the winged 
line 40438=>shadows pass from memory. Tirelessly he strode  from Citadel to  Gate,  from 
line 40439=>north to south about the wall; and with him went the Prince of Dol Amroth in 
line 40440=>his shining mail. For he and his knights still held themselves like lords in 
line 40441=>whom the race  of N®menor  ran   true. Men that  saw them  whispered  saying: 
line 40442=>'Belike the old tales speak well; there is Elvish blood in the veins of that 
line 40443=>folk, for the people of Nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago.' And then 
line 40444=>one would sing amid the gloom  some staves of the Lay of Nimrodel, or  other  
line 40445=>songs of the Vale of Anduin out of vanished years.  
line 40446=>     And  yet  - when they had  gone, the shadows closed  on  men  again, and  
line 40447=>their hearts  went cold, and the valour of Gondor  withered into ash. And so 
line 40448=>slowly  they passed out of  a  dim  day  of  fears  into  the darkness of  a  
line 40449=>desperate night. Fires  now raged unchecked in the first circle of the City, 
line 40450=>and the garrison upon the outer wall was already in many places cut off from 
line 40451=>retreat.  But the  faithful who remained there at their  posts were few; most  
line 40452=>had fled beyond the second gate. 
line 40453=>     Far behind the  battle the  River had been swiftly bridged, and all day 
line 40454=>more  force  and  gear of  war had poured across. Now at last  in the middle 
line 40455=>night  the  assault was loosed. The vanguard  passed through the trenches of 
line 40456=>fire by many devious paths that had been  left between  them. On  they came, 
line 40457=>reckless of their loss as they  approached, still bunched and herded, within 
line 40458=>the  range of  bowmen on the  wall. But indeed  there were too few  now  left  
line 40459=>there to do them great damage, though the  light of the fires showed up many 
line 40460=>a mark for archers of such skill as Gondor once had boasted. Then perceiving 
line 40461=>that the valour of the City was already beaten down, the  hidden Captain put 
line 40462=>forth his strength. Slowly the great siege-towers  built in Osgiliath rolled 
line 40463=>forward through the dark. 
line 40464=>     Messengers came again to the chamber in the White Tower, and Pippin let 
line 40465=>them enter,  for  they were  urgent. Denethor  turned  his head slowly  from 
line 40466=>Faramir's face, and  looked at them silently. 
line 40467=>
line 40468=>####-     'The first circle of  the City is burning, lord,'  they said. 'What are 
line 40469=>your  commands?  You are  still  the  Lord and Steward.  Not all will follow 
line 40470=>Mithrandir. Men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned.' 
line 40471=>     'Why? Why do the fools fly?' said Denethor. 'Better to burn sooner than 
line 40472=>late, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire! And I? I will go now to  my  
line 40473=>pyre. To my  pyre! No tomb for Denethor  and Faramir. No tomb! No  long 
line 40474=>slow 
line 40475=>sleep of death embalmed. We wil l burn like heathen kings before  ever a ship 
line 40476=>sailed hither from the West. The West has failed. Go back and burn!' 
line 40477=>     The messengers without bow or answer turned and fled. 
line 40478=>     Now Denethor  stood up and released the fevered hand of Faramir that he 
line 40479=>had held. 'He is burning, already burning,' he said sadly. 'The house of his 
line 40480=>spirit crumbles.' Then stepping softly towards Pippin he looked down at him. 
line 40481=>     'Farewell!' he said. 'Farewell, Peregrin  son of Paladin!  Your service 
line 40482=>has  been short,  and now  it is drawing to an end.  I release you from  the 
line 40483=>little that remains. Go now, and die in what way seems best to you. And with 
line 40484=>whom you will, even that friend whose  folly brought you to this death. Send 
line 40485=>for my servants and then go. Farewell!' 
line 40486=>     'I will  not say  farewell, my  lord,' said  Pippin kneeling.  And then 
line 40487=>suddenly  hobbit-like  once more, he stood up  and looked the old man in the  
line 40488=>eyes. 'I will  take your leave, sir,' he said;  'for  I want to  see Gandalf 
line 40489=>very much indeed. But he is no fool; and I will  not think of dying until he 
line 40490=>despairs of life.  But  from my word  and your service I do  not  wish to be 
line 40491=>released while you live. And if they come at last to the Citadel,  I hope to 
line 40492=>be here and stand beside you and earn  perhaps the arms that you have  given 
line 40493=>me.' 
line 40494=>     'Do as  you  will,  Master  Halfling,' said Denethor.  'But  my life is 
line 40495=>broken. Send for my servants!' He turned back to Faramir. 
line 40496=>     Pippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six  men of 
line 40497=>the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled  at the summons. But in  a  
line 40498=>quiet voice  Denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on Faramir's bed and take 
line 40499=>it up. And they  did  so, and  lifting  up the  bed  they  bore it from  the 
line 40500=>chamber. Slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be,  
line 40501=>and Denethor, now bending on a staff, followed them; and last came Pippin.  
line 40502=>     Out from the White Tower they walked, as if to a funeral,  out into the 
line 40503=>darkness,  where the overhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull  
line 40504=>red.  Softly they paced the  great  courtyard,  and  at a word from Denethor  
line 40505=>
line 40506=>####-halted beside the Withered Tree. 
line 40507=>     All was silent, save for the rumour of war in the City down  below, and 
line 40508=>they heard the  water  dripping sadly  from  the dead branches into the  dark 
line 40509=>pool. Then they went on through the Citadel gate, where the  sentinel stared  
line 40510=>at  them in wonder and dismay as they passed by.  Turning westward they came 
line 40511=>at length to  a door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle. Fen Hollen it 
line 40512=>was called, for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral, and only the 
line 40513=>Lord of  the  City might use that  way, or those who  bore the token of  the 
line 40514=>tombs and tended the houses of the  dead. Beyond it went a winding road that 
line 40515=>descended in  many curves down  to the  narrow  land  under  the  shadow  of 
line 40516=>Mindolluin's  precipice  where stood the mansions of the dead Kings  and  of 
line 40517=>their Stewards.  
line 40518=>     A porter  sat in a  little house beside  the way,  and with fear in his 
line 40519=>eyes he came  forth bearing  a lantern in his hand. At the Lord's command he 
line 40520=>unlocked the door, and  silently it  swung  back; and  they passed  through, 
line 40521=>taking  the lantern from his  hand. It was dark on the climbing road between 
line 40522=>ancient  walls  and   many -pillared   balusters   looming  in  the   swaying 
line 40523=>lantern-beam. Their  slow feet echoed as  they walked down,  down, until  at 
line 40524=>last they came to  the Silent Street,  Rath  Dnnen, between  pale  domes and 
line 40525=>empty halls and images of men long dead;  and they entered into the House of 
line 40526=>the Stewards and set down their burden. 
line 40527=>     There  Pippin,  staring uneasily about  him, saw that he was in  a wide 
line 40528=>vaulted chamber,  draped as it  were with the great shadows that  the little 
line 40529=>lantern threw upon its shrouded  walls. And dimly to  be seen were many rows 
line 40530=>of tables, carved of marble;  and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands 
line 40531=>folded, head pillowed upon stone. But one table near at hand stood broad and 
line 40532=>bare. Upon it at a sign from Denethor they laid Faramir  and his father side 
line 40533=>by side, and covered them with one covering, and stood then with bowed heads 
line 40534=>as mourners beside a bed of death. Then Denethor spoke in a low voice. 
line 40535=>     'Here we will wait,' he said. 'But send not for the embalmers. Bring us 
line 40536=>wood quick to  burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath; and pour oil upon 
line 40537=>it. And when I bid you thrust in  a torch. Do this and speak no more to  me. 
line 40538=>Farewell!' 
line 40539=>     'By your leave, lord!' said Pippin and turned and fled  in terror  from 
line 40540=>the  deathly house. 'Poor Faramir!' he thought.  'I must find Gandalf.  Poor 
line 40541=>Faramir!  Quite likely he needs medicine  more than  tears.  Oh, where can I  
line 40542=>find Gandalf? In the thick of things, I suppose; and he will have no time to 
line 40543=>
line 40544=>####-spare for dying men or madmen.' 
line 40545=>     At the door he turned to one  of the servants who had remained on guard 
line 40546=>there.  'Your master is not himself,' he  said. 'Go slow! Bring  no fire  to 
line 40547=>this place while Faramir lives! Do nothing until Gandalf comes!' 
line 40548=>     'Who is  the  master  of  Minas  Tirith?' the  man  answered. 'The Lord 
line 40549=>Denethor or the Grey Wanderer?' 
line 40550=>     'The Grey Wanderer or no one, it would seem,' said Pippin, and he  sped 
line 40551=>back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the 
line 40552=>astonished porter, out through  the door, and on, till he came near the gate 
line 40553=>of the Citadel. The sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the 
line 40554=>voice of Beregond. 
line 40555=>     'Whither do you run, Master Peregrin?' he cried. 
line 40556=>     'To find Mithrandir,' Pippin answered. 
line 40557=>     'The Lord's errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me,'  said 
line 40558=>Beregond;  'but tell  me quickly, if you may:  what goes forward? Whither has 
line 40559=>my  Lord gone? I have just come on duty, but I  heard that he passed towards 
line 40560=>the Closed Door, and men were bearing Faramir before him.' 
line 40561=>     'Yes,' said Pippin, 'to the Silent Street.' 
line 40562=>     Beregond bowed his  head  to  hide his tears.  'They said that  he  was 
line 40563=>dying,' he sighed, 'and now he is dead.' 
line 40564=>     'No,' said Pippin, 'not yet. And even now his death might be prevented, 
line 40565=>I think. But the Lord of  the City, Beregond,  has fallen before his city is 
line 40566=>taken. He is fey and dangerous.' Quickly he told of Denethor's strange words 
line 40567=>and deeds. 'I must find Gandalf at once.' 
line 40568=>     'Then you must go down to the battle.' 
line 40569=>     'I  know. The Lord has given me  leave. But,  Beregond, if you can,  do 
line 40570=>someth ing to stop any dreadful thing happening.' 
line 40571=>     'The Lord  does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave 
line 40572=>their post for any cause, save at his own command.' 
line 40573=>     'Well,  you  must  choose between orders and the life of Faramir,' said 
line 40574=>Pippin.   'And as for orders,  I think you  have a madman to deal with, not a  
line 40575=>lord. I must run. I will return if I can.' 
line 40576=>     He ran on,  down, down towards the outer city. Men flying back from the 
line 40577=>burning passed him, and some  seeing his livery turned  and shouted, but  he 
line 40578=>paid no heed. At last he was through  the Second Gate,  beyond  which  great 
line 40579=>fires  leaped up between the walls. Yet it seemed strangely silent. No noise 
line 40580=>or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard. Then suddenly there was a  
line 40581=>
line 40582=>####-dreadful cry a nd a great shock,  and a deep echoing boom. Forcing himself on 
line 40583=>against a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees. Pippin 
line 40584=>turned a  corner opening on the wide place behind  the City Gate. He stopped 
line 40585=>dead. He had found Gandalf; but he shrank back, cowering into a shadow.  
line 40586=>     Ever since the middle  night the  great assault had gone  on. The drums 
line 40587=>rolled. To the  north and to the  south company upon company  of  the  enemy 
line 40588=>pressed to the walls. There came great beasts, like moving houses in the red  
line 40589=>and fitful light, the mymakil  of  the Harad dragging through the lanes  amid 
line 40590=>the fires huge towers and engines. Yet their Captain cared not  greatly what 
line 40591=>they  did or how many might be slain:  their purpose was  only to  test  the 
line 40592=>strength of the defence and to  keep the men  of Gondor busy in many places.  
line 40593=>It was against the Gate that he would throw his heaviest weight. Very strong 
line 40594=>it might be, wrought of steel and iron, and guarded with towers and bastions 
line 40595=>of indomitable stone, yet it was the key, the weakest point in all that high 
line 40596=>and impenetrable wall. 
line 40597=>     The drums  rolled louder. Fires leaped up. Great engines crawled across 
line 40598=>the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest -tree a hundred 
line 40599=>feet in length,  swinging on mighty chains. Long had  it been forging in the 
line 40600=>dark smithies  of Mordor, and  its hideous head, founded of black steel, was 
line 40601=>shaped in  the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of  ruin lay. Grond 
line 40602=>they named it,  in memory of  the Hammer of the  Underworld  of  old.  Great 
line 40603=>beasts drew it,  Orcs surrounded  it, and  behind  walked mountain-trolls to 
line 40604=>wield it. 
line 40605=>     But about the Gate resistance still was stout, and there the knights of 
line 40606=>Dol Amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay. Shot and dart fell 
line 40607=>thick; siege-towers crashed or blazed  suddenly like torches. All before the 
line 40608=>walls on either side of the Gate the  ground was choked  with wreck and with 
line 40609=>bodies of the slain; yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up.  
line 40610=>     Grond crawled on. Upon  its housing no fire would catch; and though now 
line 40611=>and again some great beast that  hauled it would go  mad and spread stamping 
line 40612=>ruin among  the  orcs  innumerable  that guarded  it, their bodies were cast  
line 40613=>aside from its path and others took their place. 
line 40614=>     Grond crawled on. The drums  rolled wildly. Over the  hills of slain  a  
line 40615=>hideous shape appeared: a horseman, tall,  hooded, cloaked in black. Slowly, 
line 40616=>trampling the fallen,  he rode forth, heeding no  longer any dart. He halted 
line 40617=>and held up  a long pale sword. And as he did so a great  fear  fell on all, 
line 40618=>defender  and foe alike; and the hands of men drooped to their sides, and no  
line 40619=>
line 40620=>####-bow sang. For a moment all was still. 
line 40621=>     The drums rolled and rattled. With a vast rush Grond was hurled forward 
line 40622=>by  huge hands. It reached the Gate. It  swung. A  deep boom rumbled through 
line 40623=>the City like thunder running in the clouds. But the doors of iron and posts 
line 40624=>of steel withstood the stroke. 
line 40625=>     Then  the  Black Captain rose  in  his  stirrups and  cried  aloud in a  
line 40626=>dreadful voice, speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and  terror 
line 40627=>to rend both heart and stone. 
line 40628=>     Thrice he cried.  Thrice  the great ram boomed.  And suddenly  upon the 
line 40629=>last  stroke the Gate of Gondor broke. As if stricken by some blasting spell 
line 40630=>it burst asunder:  there  was  a flash of searing  lightning, and the  doors 
line 40631=>tumbled in riven fragments to the ground. 
line 40632=>     In rode the Lord  of the Nazgyl. A great black  shape against the fires 
line 40633=>beyond he loomed up, grown  to a vast menace of despair. In rode the Lord of 
line 40634=>the Nazgyl, under  the  archway that no  enemy ever yet had  passed, and all  
line 40635=>fled before his face. 
line 40636=>     All save one. There waiting,  silent and still in the  space before the 
line 40637=>Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone  among the free 
line 40638=>horses 
line 40639=>of  the earth endured the terror, unmoving,  steadfast as  a graven image in 
line 40640=>Rath Dnnen. 
line 40641=>     'You  cannot enter here,' said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. 'Go 
line 40642=>back to the abyss prepared  for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that 
line 40643=>awaits you and your Master. Go!' 
line 40644=>     The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown;  
line 40645=>and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires  shone between it and 
line 40646=>the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly 
line 40647=>laughter. 
line 40648=>     'Old fool!' he  said. 'Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death 
line 40649=>when you see it? Die  now and curse in vain!' And  with that he lifted  high 
line 40650=>his sword and flames ran down the blade. 
line 40651=>     Gandalf did  not move.  And in that  very moment,  away  behind in some 
line 40652=>courtyard  of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear  he crowed,  recking 
line 40653=>nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming  only  the morning that in the sky far  
line 40654=>above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn. 
line 40655=>     And  as  if in  answer there  came from far away  another note.  Horns,  
line 40656=>horns, horns. In dark Mindolluin's sides  they dimly  echoed. Great horns of 
line 40657=>
line 40658=>####-the North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last. 
line 40659=>
line 40660=>####- 
line 40661=> 
line 40662=>
line 40663=>Chapter 5. The Ride of the Rohirrim 
line 40664=>
line 40665=> 
line 40666=> 
line 40667=>     It was dark and Merry could see  nothing as he lay on the ground rolled 
line 40668=>in a blanket; yet  though the night was airless and windless, all  about him 
line 40669=>hidden  trees were sighing  softly. He lifted  his  head.  Then he heard  it 
line 40670=>again: a  sound like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain-steps. The 
line 40671=>throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up again  at some other  point, 
line 40672=>now nearer, now further off. He wondered if the watchmen had heard it. 
line 40673=>     He  could not see  them,  but he  knew  that  all  round  him were  the 
line 40674=>companies of the Rohirrim. He could smell the horses in  the dark, and could 
line 40675=>hear their shiftings  and their soft stamping on  the needle-covered ground. 
line 40676=>The host  was bivouacked in  the  pine-woods that  clustered about  Eilenach  
line 40677=>Beacon, a tall  hill standing up from  the long ridges of the Dr®adan Forest  
line 40678=>that lay beside the great road in East Anurien. 
line 40679=>     Tired as he was Merry could not sleep. He had ridden now  for four days 
line 40680=>on end,  and the ever -deepening gloom had slowly  weighed down his heart. He 
line 40681=>began to wonder   why he had been so  eager to come,  when he had  been given 
line 40682=>every excuse, even his lord's command, to  stay behind. He wondered, too, if 
line 40683=>the  old  King knew  that he had been disobeyed and  was angry. Perhaps not. 
line 40684=>There seemed  to be  some understanding   between Dernhelm  and Elfhelm,  
line 40685=>the 
line 40686=>Marshal  who commanded  the  jored in which they were riding. He and all  his 
line 40687=>men ignored Merry and  pretended not to hear if he spoke. He might have been 
line 40688=>just  another bag that  Dernhelm was  carrying. Dernhelm was  no comfort: he 
line 40689=>never spoke to anyone. Merry felt small, unwanted, and  lonely. Now the time 
line 40690=>was anxious, and  the host was in peril.  They were less than a  day's  ride 
line 40691=>from the out-walls of Minas Tirith  that encircled the townlands. Scouts had 
line 40692=>been sent ahead. Some  had not returned.  Others hastening back had reported 
line 40693=>that the  road was  held in  force against  them.  A  host  of the enemy was 
line 40694=>encamped upon it, three miles west of Amon Don, and some strength of men 
line 40695=>was 
line 40696=>already  thrusting along the road  and  was no more than three  leagues away.  
line 40697=>Orcs were roving in  the hills  and  woods along the  roadside. The king and  
line 40698=>Jomer held council in the watches of the night. 
line 40699=>     Merry  wanted somebody to  talk to, and he thought of Pippin.  But that 
line 40700=>
line 40701=>####-only increased his  restlessness. Poor Pippin, shut up in the great city  of 
line 40702=>stone,  lonely and  afraid. Merry wished he was a tall Rider  like Jomer and 
line 40703=>could  blow  a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue.  He sat up, 
line 40704=>listening  to the  drums  that  were  beating again,  now  nearer  at  hand. 
line 40705=>Presently  he  heard  voices  speaking  low, and  he  saw  dim half-shrouded  
line 40706=>lanterns passing  through the trees. Men nearby began to move uncertainly in 
line 40707=>the dark. 
line 40708=>     A tall figure loomed up and stumbled over  him, cu rsing the tree-roots.  
line 40709=>He recognized the voice of the Marshal, Elfhelm. 
line 40710=>     'I am not a tree-root, Sir,' he said, 'nor a bag, but a bruised hobbit. 
line 40711=>The least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot.' 
line 40712=>     'Anything that  can keep so  in this  devi l's mirk,' answered  Elfhelm. 
line 40713=>'But my lord sends word that we must  set ourselves in readiness: orders may 
line 40714=>come for a sudden move.' 
line 40715=>     'Is  the enemy coming then?' asked Merry  anxiously.  'Are those  their 
line 40716=>drums? I began to think I was  imagining them, as no one else seemed to take 
line 40717=>any notice of them.' 
line 40718=>     'Nay, nay,' said  Elfhelm, 'the enemy  is on the road not in the hills.  
line 40719=>You hear the Woses, the Wild Men of the Woods: thus they talk together  from 
line 40720=>afar. They still haunt Dr®adan Forest, it is said. Remnants of an older time 
line 40721=>they be, living few and  secretly, wild and wary as the beasts. They go  not 
line 40722=>to war with Gondor or  the Mark; but  now they  are troubled by the darkness 
line 40723=>and the  coming of the orcs:  they fear lest the Dark Years be returning, as 
line 40724=>seems  likely enough.  Let us be thankful that they are  not hunting us: for  
line 40725=>they use poisoned  arrows,  it is  said,  and  they  are  woodcrafty  beyond 
line 40726=>compare. But  they have offered their services to  Thjoden. Even now one  of 
line 40727=>their headmen is being taken to  the king. Yonder  go the lights.  So much I 
line 40728=>have heard but no more. And now I must busy myself with my  lord's 
line 40729=>commands. 
line 40730=>Pack yourself up, Master Bag!' He vanished into the shadows.  
line 40731=>     Merry did not like this talk of wild men  and poisoned darts, but quite 
line 40732=>apart from that a great weight of dread  was on him. Waiting was unbearable. 
line 40733=>He  longed to know  what was going to happen. He got up and soon was 
line 40734=>walking 
line 40735=>warily in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees.  
line 40736=>     Presently he came to an open  space  where a small tent had been set up 
line 40737=>for the king under a great tree. A large lantern, covered above, was hanging 
line 40738=>
line 40739=>####-from a bough and cast  a  pale circle of  light below. There sat Thjoden and 
line 40740=>Jomer, and before  them  on the ground sat a strange  squat shape of a  man,  
line 40741=>gnarled as an old  stone, and the hairs of his scanty beard straggled on his 
line 40742=>lumpy chin like  dry  moss.  He was  short-legged and fat-armed,  thick  and 
line 40743=>stumpy, and  clad only  with grass about his waist. Merry  felt  that he  had 
line 40744=>seen  him  before  somewhere, and suddenly  he remembered  the  P®kel-men 
line 40745=>of 
line 40746=>Dunharrow. Here  was one of those old  images  brought to life, or  maybe  a 
line 40747=>creature descended  in true line through endless years from the models  used 
line 40748=>by the forgotten craftsmen long ago. 
line 40749=>     There was  a silence as Merry crept nearer, and then the Wild Man began 
line 40750=>to speak, in answer to some  question, it  seemed.  His  voice  was deep and 
line 40751=>guttural,  yet to Merry's  surprise he spoke  the Common Speech, though in a 
line 40752=>halting fashion, and uncouth words were mingled with it. 
line 40753=>     'No, father of  Horse-men,' he  said,  'we fight not. Hunt  only.  Kill 
line 40754=>gorgyn  in woods, hate orc-folk. You hate gorgyn too. We help as we can. Wild 
line 40755=>Men have long ears and long eyes; know all  paths. Wild Men live here before 
line 40756=>Stone-houses; before Tall Men come up out of Water.' 
line 40757=>     'But our need is for aid in battle,' said Jomer. 'How will you and your 
line 40758=>folk help us?' 
line 40759=>     'Bring news,' said  the Wild Man. 'We look out from hills. We climb big 
line 40760=>mountain  and look down.  Stone-city is shut. Fire burns there  outside; now 
line 40761=>inside too. You  wish to come there? Then you must be  quick. But gorgyn and 
line 40762=>men out  of  far-away,'  he waved a  short gnarled  arm  eastward,  'sit  on 
line 40763=>horse-road. Very many, mor e than Horse-men.' 
line 40764=>     'How do you know that?' said Jomer. 
line 40765=>     The old man's flat face and dark eyes showed nothing, but his voice was 
line 40766=>sullen  with displeasure.  'Wild  men are wild, free, but not  children,' he 
line 40767=>answered. 'I am great headman, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn. I count many things: stars in 
line 40768=>sky, leaves  on trees, men in  the dark. You have a score of scores  counted 
line 40769=>ten  times and five. They  have more.  Big fight, and who will win? And many 
line 40770=>more walk round walls of Stone-houses.' 
line 40771=>     'Alas! he speaks all too shrewdly,' said  Thjoden. 'And our scouts  say 
line 40772=>that they have  cast trenches  and  stakes across the road.  We cannot sweep 
line 40773=>them away in sudden onset.' 
line 40774=>     'And yet we need great haste,' said Jomer. 'Mundburg is on fire!' 
line 40775=>     'Let Ghvn-buri-Ghvn finish!' said the Wild Man. 'More than one road  he  
line 40776=>
line 40777=>####-knows. He will lead you by road where no pits are, no gorgyn walk, only Wild 
line 40778=>Men  and  beasts. Many paths were  made  when Stonehouse-folk were 
line 40779=>stronger. 
line 40780=>They carved  hills as  hunters carve beast -flesh.  Wild  Men  think they ate 
line 40781=>stone for food. They  went through Dr®adan  to Rimmon with great wains. 
line 40782=>They 
line 40783=>go  no longer. Road is forgotten, but not by Wild  Men. Over hill and behind 
line 40784=>hill it  lies still  under grass and tree, there behind Rimmon  and down  to 
line 40785=>Don, and back at the  end to  Horse -men's road. Wild Men will show  you that 
line 40786=>road. Then you will kill gorgyn  and drive away bad dark  with  bright iron, 
line 40787=>and Wild Men can go back to sleep in the wild woods.' 
line 40788=>     Jomer  and  the king  spoke  together  in their  own  tongue. At length 
line 40789=>Thjoden turned to the Wild Man.   'We will receive your offer,' he said.  'For  
line 40790=>though we leave a host of foes behind, what matter? If the Stone-city falls, 
line 40791=>then we shall  have  no returning. If it  is saved, then the orc-host itself 
line 40792=>will be cut off. If you are faithful, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn, then we will  give you  
line 40793=>rich reward, and you shall have the friendship of the Mark for ever.' 
line 40794=>     'Dead  men are not friends to living men, and give them no gifts,' said 
line 40795=>the Wild Man.  'But if you live after the Darkness, then leave Wild Men alone 
line 40796=>in the woods and do  not hunt them like beasts any more. Ghvn-buri-Ghvn will 
line 40797=>not lead  you into trap. He will go himself with father of Horse-men, and if 
line 40798=>he leads you wrong, you will kill him.' 
line 40799=>     'So be it!' said Thjoden. 
line 40800=>     'How long will it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road?' 
line 40801=>asked Jomer. 'We must go at foot-pace, if you guide us; and  I doubt not the 
line 40802=>way is narrow.' 
line 40803=>     'Wild Men go quick on feet,' said Ghvn. 'Way is wide for four horses in 
line 40804=>Stonewain  Valley  yonder,'  he waved his hand southwards;  'but  narrow  at 
line 40805=>beginning and at end.  Wild  Man could walk from here to Don between sunrise 
line 40806=>and noon.' 
line 40807=>     'Then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders,' said  Jomer; 
line 40808=>'but  we must reckon rather on some ten hours for all. Things unforeseen may 
line 40809=>hinder us, and if our host is all strung out, it will be long  ere it can be 
line 40810=>set in order when we issue from the hills. What is the hour now?' 
line 40811=>     'Who knows?' said Thjoden. 'All is night now.' 
line 40812=>     'It is all dark, but  it is not all night.' said Ghvn.  'When Sun comes 
line 40813=>we   feel   her,  even  when  she   is  hidden.   Already  she  climbs  over  
line 40814=>
line 40815=>####-East -mountains. It is the opening of day in the sky-fields.' 
line 40816=>     'Then  we must  set  out  as soon as may be,' said Jomer.  'Even so  we 
line 40817=>cannot hope to come to Gondor's aid today.' 
line 40818=>     Merry waited to  hear  no  more, but slipped away to get ready for  the 
line 40819=>summons to the march. This was  the last stage before the battle. It did not 
line 40820=>seem  likely to him  that  many of them would survive it. But he thought  of 
line 40821=>Pippin and the flames in Minas Tirith and thrust down his own dread. 
line 40822=>     All  went well that day, and no sight  or sound had  they  of the enemy 
line 40823=>waiting to waylay them. The Wild Men had put  out a screen  of wary hunters,  
line 40824=>so that no orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the hills. The 
line 40825=>light was more dim  than ever as they drew nearer to  the  beleaguered city, 
line 40826=>and the Riders  passed  in long files like dark shadows  of men and  hor ses. 
line 40827=>Each  company  was guided by  a wild woodman; but old Ghvn walked beside 
line 40828=>the 
line 40829=>king. The  start had been slower than was  hoped, for it had  taken time for  
line 40830=>the Riders, walking and leading their horses, to find paths over the thickly 
line 40831=>wooded ridges behind   their camp  and down into the hidden Stonewain Valley. 
line 40832=>It was  late in the afternoon  when the leaders came  to wide  grey thickets 
line 40833=>stretching beyond the eastward side of  Amon Don, and masking a great gap in 
line 40834=>the line of hills that from Nardol to Don ran east and west. Through the gap 
line 40835=>the forgotten wain-road long ago had run down,  back into the main horse -way 
line 40836=>from the City  through Anurien; but now for many lives of men  trees had had 
line 40837=>their way with  it, and it had vanished, broken and buried under  the leaves 
line 40838=>of uncounted years. But  the  thickets offered to the Riders their last hope 
line 40839=>of cover before they went into open battle; for beyond them lay the road and 
line 40840=>the plains  of Anduin,  while east and southwards  the slopes  were bare and  
line 40841=>rocky,  as the writhen hills  gathered  themselves  together and climbed up, 
line 40842=>bastion upon bastion, into the great mass and shoulders of Mindolluin. 
line 40843=>     The leading company was halted, and as those behind filed up out of the 
line 40844=>trough of the Stonewain Valley they spread out  a nd passed to camping-places 
line 40845=>under the grey trees. The king  summoned the captains to council. Jomer sent 
line 40846=>out scouts to spy upon the road; but old Ghvn shook his head. 
line 40847=>     'No good to send Horse-men,' he said. 'Wild Men  have already  seen all 
line 40848=>that can be seen in the bad air. They will come soon and speak to me here.' 
line 40849=>     The  captains came;  and  then  out of  the  trees crept  warily  other  
line 40850=>p®kel-shapes so like old Ghvn that Merry  could hardly tell them apart. They 
line 40851=>spoke to Ghvn in a strange throaty language. 
line 40852=>
line 40853=>####-     Presently Ghvn turned to the king. 'Wild Men say many things ' he said. 
line 40854=>'First, be wary! Still many  men in camp beyond Don, an hour's walk yonder,' 
line 40855=>he waved  his arm west  towards the black beacon. 'But  none  to see between 
line 40856=>here and Stone-folk's new walls. Many busy  there. Walls stand up no longer: 
line 40857=>gorgyn  knock them down with earth -thunder and with clubs of black iron. They 
line 40858=>are unwary and do not  look about  them. They think  their friends watch all  
line 40859=>roads!' At that old  Ghvn made a curious gurgling noise, and it seemed  that 
line 40860=>he was laughing. 
line 40861=>     'Good tidings!' cried Jomer. 'Even in this gloom hope gleams again. Our 
line 40862=>Enemy's devices  oft serve us in his  despite.  The accursed darkness itself 
line 40863=>has been a cloak to us. And now, lusting to destroy Gondor and throw it down 
line 40864=>stone from stone, his  orcs have  taken away  my greatest fear. The out-wall 
line 40865=>could have been held long against us. Now we  can sweep through - if once we 
line 40866=>win so far.' 
line 40867=>     'Once again I thank you, Ghvn-buri-Ghvn of  the woods,'  said  Thjoden.  
line 40868=>'Good fortune go with you for tidings and for guidance!' 
line 40869=>     'Kill  gorgyn! Kill orc-folk! No other words please Wild Men ' answered  
line 40870=>Ghvn. 'Drive away bad air and darkness with bright iron!' 
line 40871=>     'To do these things we have ridden far,'  said the king,  'and we shall 
line 40872=>attempt them. But what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show.' 
line 40873=>     Ghvn-buri-Ghvn  squatted down and touched the earth with his horny brow 
line 40874=>in token of farewell. Then he got up as if to depart.  But suddenly he stood 
line 40875=>looking u p like some startled  woodland  animal snuffling  a  strange air. A 
line 40876=>light came in his eyes.  
line 40877=>     'Wind  is  changing!' he cried, and  with  that, in a  twinkling as  it 
line 40878=>seemed, he and his fellows had vanished into the glooms, never to be seen by 
line 40879=>any Rider of Rohan again. Not long after far away  eastward  the faint drums 
line 40880=>throbbed again. Yet  to no heart in all the host came any fear that the Wild 
line 40881=>Men were unfaithful, strange and unlovely though they might appear. 
line 40882=>     'We need  no further  guidance,' said E lfhelm; 'for there are riders in 
line 40883=>the host who have ridden down to Mundburg in days of peace. I for  one. When 
line 40884=>we come to  the road it will veer south, and there will lie before  us still 
line 40885=>seven leagues ere we reach the wall of the townlands. Along most of that way 
line 40886=>there  is  much  grass  on  either side  of  the road. On that  stretch  the 
line 40887=>errand-riders of  Gondor reckoned to  make their greatest speed. We may ride 
line 40888=>it swiftly and without great rumour.' 
line 40889=>     'Then  since we  must  look  for  fell deeds and  the  need  of all our 
line 40890=>
line 40891=>####-strength,' said Jomer,  'I  counsel that we  rest now, and set out hence  by 
line 40892=>night, and so  time our going that we come upon the fields  when tomorrow is 
line 40893=>as light as it will be, or when our lord gives the signal.' 
line 40894=>     To this the king  assented, and the captains departed. But soon Elfhelm 
line 40895=>returned.  'The scouts  have found naught  to  report beyond  the grey wood, 
line 40896=>lord,' he said, 'save two men only: two dead men and two dead horses.' 
line 40897=>     'Well?' said Jomer. 'What of it?' 
line 40898=>     'This, lord: they were errand-riders  of  Gondor; Hirgon was one maybe. 
line 40899=>At least his hand  still clasped  the Red Arrow, but his head was  hewn off. 
line 40900=>And this  also:  it would  seem by the signs that they were fleeing westward 
line 40901=>when they fell. As I read it, they found the enemy already on the  out-wall, 
line 40902=>or assailing it, when they  returned - and that would  be two nights ago, if 
line 40903=>they  used  fresh  horses  from the posts, as is their wont. They  could not 
line 40904=>reach the City and turned back.' 
line 40905=>     'Alas!' said  Thjoden. 'T hen  Denethor has heard  no news of our riding 
line 40906=>and will despair of our coming.' 
line 40907=>     'Need brooks no delay, yet late is better than never,' said Jomer. 'And 
line 40908=>mayhap in this time shall the old saw be proved truer than ever before since  
line 40909=>men spoke with mouth.' 
line 40910=>     It was night. On either side of the  road the  host of Rohan was moving 
line 40911=>silently.  Now  the  road  passing  about the skirts  of  Mindolluin  turned 
line 40912=>southward. Far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the 
line 40913=>black sky and  the sides of the great mountain  loomed dark against it. They  
line 40914=>were drawing near the Rammas of the Pelennor; but the day was not yet come. 
line 40915=>     The  king rode in the  midst  of the leading company, his household-men 
line 40916=>about him. Elfhelm's  jored came  next; and now Merry noticed  that  Dernhelm 
line 40917=>had left his place and in the darkness was moving steadily forward, until at 
line 40918=>last he was riding  just  in rear of the  king's guard. There came  a check. 
line 40919=>Merry  heard voices  in front speaking softly.  Out-riders had come back who 
line 40920=>had ventured forward almost to the wall. They came to the king. 
line 40921=>     'There are great  fires, lord,'  said one. 'The City is  all set  about 
line 40922=>with flame, and the field  is full of foes.  But all seem drawn off  to  the 
line 40923=>assault. As well as we could guess, there  are  few left  upon the out-wall, 
line 40924=>and they are heedless, busy in destruction.' 
line 40925=>     'Do you remember the  Wild Man's words,  lord?' said another.  'I  live 
line 40926=>upon the open Wold in days of peace;  Wndfara is my name, and to me also the 
line 40927=>air brings messages. Already the  wind  is turning. There comes a breath out 
line 40928=>
line 40929=>####-of the South;  there  is a sea -tang in it, faint  though it be.  The morning 
line 40930=>will bring new things.  Above  the reek  it will  be dawn  when you pass the 
line 40931=>wall.' 
line 40932=>     'If  you speak truly, Wndfara, then  may  you live beyond  this day  in 
line 40933=>years of blessedness!' said Thjoden.  He turned to the  men of his household 
line 40934=>who were  near, and he spoke now  in a clear voice  so that many also of the 
line 40935=>riders of the first jored heard him: 
line 40936=>     'Now is the hour come, Riders of the Mark, sons  of Eorl! Foes and fire 
line 40937=>are before you,  and your homes far  behind.  Yet, though you fight upon  an 
line 40938=>alien field, the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever. Oaths 
line 40939=>ye  have  taken:  now fulfil them  all,  to  lord  and  land  and league  of 
line 40940=>friendship!' 
line 40941=>     Men clashed spear upon shield. 
line 40942=>     'Jomer, my son! You  lead the first jored,' said Thjoden; 'and it shall 
line 40943=>go behind the king's banner in the centre. Elfhelm, lead your company to the 
line 40944=>right when we pass the wall.  And  Grimbold shall lead his towards the left. 
line 40945=>Let  the other companies behind follow these three that lead,  as  they have 
line 40946=>chance.  Strike wherever the  enemy gathers. Other plans we cannot make, for  
line 40947=>we know  not  yet  how things  stand upon the field.  Forth now, and fear no  
line 40948=>darkness!' 
line 40949=>     The leading company rode off as swiftly as they could, for it was still 
line 40950=>deep dark,  whatever change Wndfara  might forebode. Merry was riding 
line 40951=>behind 
line 40952=>Dernhelm,  clutching  with the  left hand  while  with the other he tried to 
line 40953=>loosen his sword in its sheath. He felt now  bitterly  the  truth of the old 
line 40954=>king's  words: in such  a battle what would you do Meriadoc?  Just this,' he 
line 40955=>thought: 'encumber a rider, and hope at best to stay in my  seat and  not be 
line 40956=>pounded to death by galloping hoofs!' 
line 40957=>     It was no  more than a  league  to where the out-walls had stood.  They 
line 40958=>soon reached them; too soon for  Merry. Wild cries broke out, and  there was 
line 40959=>some clash of arms, but it was brief. The orcs busy about the walls were few  
line 40960=>and amazed, and they were quickly  slain or driven off. Before the  ruin  of 
line 40961=>the north-gate  in the Rammas the king halted again. The first  jored drew up 
line 40962=>behind  him and about him on either side.  Dernhelm kept close to the  king,  
line 40963=>though Elfhelm's company was away on  the right. Grimbold's men turned 
line 40964=>aside 
line 40965=>and passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward. 
line 40966=>
line 40967=>####-     Merry peered from behind Dernhelm's  back. Far away, maybe ten miles or  
line 40968=>more, there was a great burning, but between it and the Riders lines of fire 
line 40969=>blazed in  a vast crescent, at the nearest point less than a league distant. 
line 40970=>He could make out little more on the dark plain,  and as yet he  neither saw 
line 40971=>any hope of morning, nor felt any wind, changed or unchanged. 
line 40972=>     Now silently the host of Rohan moved forward  into the field of Gondor,  
line 40973=>pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising  tide through breaches in  a  
line 40974=>dike  that men  have  thought secure.  But  the  mind  and will of the Black  
line 40975=>Captain were bent wholly on the falling city, and   as yet no tidings came to 
line 40976=>him warning that his designs held any flaw. 
line 40977=>     After a while the  king led  his  men away somewhat  eastward, to  come 
line 40978=>between  the  fires  of  the siege  and the outer  fields. Still  they  were 
line 40979=>unchallenged,  and  still Thjoden gave  no signal. At last  he  halted  once 
line 40980=>again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very 
line 40981=>shadow  of  death.  The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon  Snowmane, 
line 40982=>motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith,  as i f  stricken suddenly 
line 40983=>by  anguish, or by  dread.  He  seemed to shrink  down, cowed by  age. Merry 
line 40984=>himself  felt as  if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled  on him. 
line 40985=>His  heart  beat slowly. Time  seemed poised in  uncertainty. They  were too 
line 40986=>late! Too late was worse  than never! Perhaps Thjoden would  quail,  bow his 
line 40987=>old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.  
line 40988=>     Then suddenly Merry felt  it at  last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was 
line 40989=>in his face! Light was glimmering. Far, far  away, in  the  South the clouds 
line 40990=>could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay 
line 40991=>beyond them. 
line 40992=>     But at that same moment  there was a flash, as if lightning  had sprung 
line 40993=>from the earth beneath the City. For a searing second it stood dazzling  far 
line 40994=>off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glittering needle: and then 
line 40995=>as the darkness closed  again  there came rolling over  the fields  a  great 
line 40996=>boom. 
line 40997=>     At that sound  the bent shape  of the king sprang suddenly  erect. Tall 
line 40998=>and  proud he seemed again; and  rising in his  stirrups he  cried in a loud 
line 40999=>voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before: 
line 41000=>     Arise, arise, Riders of Thjoden! 
line 41001=>     Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter! 
line 41002=>     spear shall be shaken, shie ld be splintered, 
line 41003=>     a sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises! 
line 41004=>
line 41005=>####-     Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor! 
line 41006=>     With that he seized a great horn from Guthlbf his banner -bearer, and he 
line 41007=>blew such a blast  upon it  that it burst asunder. And  straightway all  the 
line 41008=>horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the  blowing  of the horns of 
line 41009=>Rohan  in that  hour was like a  storm  upon the plain and  a thunder in the 
line 41010=>mountains.  
line 41011=>     Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor! 
line 41012=>     Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the  horse sprang away.  Behind 
line 41013=>him his banner  blew in the wind,  white horse upon a field of green, but he 
line 41014=>outpaced it. After  him thundered the knights of his house,  but he was ever  
line 41015=>before them.  Jomer rode there, the white horsetail on his  helm floating in 
line 41016=>his speed, and the front of the first jored roared like a breaker foaming to 
line 41017=>the shore, but Thjoden  could  not  be overtaken.  Fey  he  seemed,  or  the 
line 41018=>battle-fury of his fathers ran  like new tire in his veins, and he was borne 
line 41019=>up on Snowmane lik e a god of old, even as Oroml the  Great in the battle  of 
line 41020=>the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo!  
line 41021=>it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the 
line 41022=>white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a  wind from the sea; 
line 41023=>and  the darkness was  removed, and the hosts  of Mordor wailed,  and terror  
line 41024=>took them, and they fled,  and died, and the hoofs of  wrath rode over them. 
line 41025=>And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang  as they slew,  
line 41026=>for the  joy of battle was on  them, and the sound of their singing that was 
line 41027=>fair and terrible came even to the City. 
line 41028=> 
line 41029=>
line 41030=>####- 
line 41031=>
line 41032=>Chapter 6. The Battle of the Pelennor 
line 41033=>Fields 
line 41034=>
line 41035=> 
line 41036=> 
line 41037=>     But  it was  no  orc-chieftain or  brigand that led  the  assault  upon 
line 41038=>Gondor. The darkness was breaking too soon, before the date  that his Master 
line 41039=>had set for it:  fortune had betrayed him for  the moment, and the world had 
line 41040=>turned against him; victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched 
line 41041=>out his  hand  to seize it.  But  his arm was long. He was still  in command, 
line 41042=>wielding  great  powers. King, Ringwraith,  Lord of the Nazgyl, he  had many 
line 41043=>weapons. He left the Gate and vanished. 
line 41044=>     Thjoden  King of  the  Mark  had reached the road from the Gate to  the 
line 41045=>River, and he turned towards the City that was now less than a mile distant. 
line 41046=>He slackened his speed  a little, seeking new foes,  and  his  knights  came 
line 41047=>about him, and Dernhelm was with  them. Ahead nearer the walls Elfhelm's 
line 41048=>men 
line 41049=>were among the  siege-engines, hewing, slaying, driving their foes into  the 
line 41050=>fire-pits. Well nigh all the northern half of the Pelennor was overrun,  and 
line 41051=>there camps were  blazing, orcs were  flying towards  the  River like  herds 
line 41052=>before the hunters; and the Rohirrim went hither  and thither at their will. 
line 41053=>But they had not yet overthrown the siege, nor won the Gate. Many foes stood 
line 41054=>before  it, and on the  further  half of the  plain were  other hosts  still 
line 41055=>unfought. Southward beyond the road lay  the main force of the Haradrim, and 
line 41056=>there  their  horsemen were gathered about the standard of  their chieftain. 
line 41057=>And he looked  out, and in the growing light he saw the banner of  the king,  
line 41058=>and that  it was far  ahead of the battle with few men about it. Then he was 
line 41059=>filled with a  red wrath  and shouted aloud, and  displaying  his  standard, 
line 41060=>black serpent upon  scarlet, he  came against the white  horse and the green 
line 41061=>with great press of men; and  the  drawing of the scimitars of the Southrons 
line 41062=>was like a glitter of stars.  
line 41063=>     Then Thjoden was  aware of  him, and  would not wait for his onset, but 
line 41064=>crying to Snowmane he  charged headlong to greet him. Great was the clash of 
line 41065=>their  meeting. But the white fury  of the Northmen burned the  hotter,  and 
line 41066=>more skilled  was  their knighthood with long spears  and bitter. Fewer were 
line 41067=>they  but they  clove through the Southrons  like a fire-bolt  in  a forest. 
line 41068=>Right  through the press  drove  Thjoden Thengel's son,  and  his  spear was 
line 41069=>
line 41070=>####-shivered as he threw down  their chieftain.  Out  swept  his sword,  and  he 
line 41071=>spurred  to  the  standard,  hewed staff  and bearer;  and the black serpent 
line 41072=>foundered. Then all that was left unslain of  their cavalry  turned and fled 
line 41073=>far away. 
line 41074=>     But  lo! suddenly in  the  midst of the glory  of the  king his  golden 
line 41075=>shield was dimmed. The new morning was blotted from the sky. Dark fell 
line 41076=>about 
line 41077=>him. Horses reared and screamed. Men cast  from the saddle lay grovelling on 
line 41078=>the ground. 
line 41079=>     'To  me!  To me!' cried Thjoden. 'Up Eorlingas!  Fear no darkness!' But 
line 41080=>Snowmane wild with terror stood up  on high, fighting with the air, and then 
line 41081=>with a great scream he crashed upon his side: a black dart had pierced  him. 
line 41082=>The king fell beneath him. 
line 41083=>     The great shadow  descended like a falling cloud. And behold!  it was a  
line 41084=>winged  creature: if bird, then  greater than all  other  birds, and it  was 
line 41085=>naked, and neither quill nor  feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were 
line 41086=>as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank. A creature of an older  
line 41087=>world maybe it  was,  whose  kind,  fingering  in  forgotten mountains  cold 
line 41088=>beneath the Moon,  outstayed their day,  and in hideous eyrie bred this last 
line 41089=>untimely brood, apt to evil. And the Dark  Lord took it, and nursed it  with 
line 41090=>fell meats, until  it grew beyond the measure of all  other things that fly; 
line 41091=>and he gave it to his servant to be his steed. Down, down it came, and then, 
line 41092=>folding its fingered webs, it gave a croaking cry, and settled upon the body 
line 41093=>of Snowmane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck. 
line 41094=>     Upon it  sat a shape, black -mantled , huge and threatening. A  crown  of 
line 41095=>steel he bore, but between rim and robe naught was there to see, save only a  
line 41096=>deadly  gleam of eyes: the Lord  of the  Nazgyl. To the air he had returned, 
line 41097=>summoning  his  steed ere the darkness failed,  and now he was  come  again, 
line 41098=>bringing ruin,  turning hope to despair, and victory to death. A great black  
line 41099=>mace he wielded. 
line 41100=>     But Thjoden  was  not utterly forsaken. The  knights of  his house  lay 
line 41101=>slain about him, or else mastered by the madness of  their steeds were borne 
line 41102=>far away. Yet one stood  there still:  Dernhelm  the  young, faithful beyond 
line 41103=>fear; and he wept, for he had  loved his lord as a father. Right through the 
line 41104=>charge Merry had  been borne unharmed behind him, until the Shadow came; 
line 41105=>and 
line 41106=>then  Windfola  had thrown  them in his terror, and now  ran  wild upon  the 
line 41107=>
line 41108=>####-plain. Merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast, and  such a horror was 
line 41109=>on him that he was blind and sick. 
line 41110=>     'King's man! King's man!' his heart cried within him. 'You must stay by 
line 41111=>him. As a father you shall be to me, you said.' But his will made no answer, 
line 41112=>and his body shook. He dared not open his eyes or look up. 
line 41113=>     Then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard Dernhelm 
line 41114=>speaking; yet now the voice seemed strange, recalling  some other voice  that 
line 41115=>he had known. 
line 41116=>     'Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!' 
line 41117=>     A cold voice answered: 'Come not between the Nazgyl and his prey! Or he 
line 41118=>will not slay thee  in thy turn. He  will  bear  thee away to the houses  of 
line 41119=>lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy 
line 41120=>shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye.' 
line 41121=>     A sword rang as it was drawn. 'Do what you will; but  I will hinder it, 
line 41122=>if I may.' 
line 41123=>     'Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!' 
line 41124=>     Then  Merry heard of all sounds in that  hour the  strangest. It seemed 
line 41125=>that Dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the  ring of steel. 'But 
line 41126=>no living man am I! You look upon a  woman.  Jowyn I am, Jomund's  
line 41127=>daughter. 
line 41128=>You  stand  between me and my lord and kin. Begone, if you be not deathless!  
line 41129=>For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.' 
line 41130=>     The winged creature screamed at her, but the Ringwraith made no answer, 
line 41131=>and was silent, as if in sudden doubt. Very amazement for a moment conquered 
line 41132=>Merry's fear. He  opened his  eyes  and the  blackness was lifted from them. 
line 41133=>There some paces from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it, 
line 41134=>and above  it loomed the  Nazgyl Lord like a shadow of despa ir.  A little to 
line 41135=>the left facing them stood she whom he had called Dernhelm. But the  helm of 
line 41136=>her  secrecy,  had fallen from  her, and her bright  hair, released from its 
line 41137=>bonds, gleamed with pale gold upon  her shoulders. Her eyes  grey as the sea 
line 41138=>were  hard  and fell, and yet tears were  on  her cheek. A sword was in  her  
line 41139=>hand, and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy's eyes.  
line 41140=>     Jowyn  it  was,  and  Dernhelm  also. For into Merry's mind flashed the 
line 41141=>memory of the face that he saw at the riding from Dunharrow: the face of one 
line 41142=>that goes seeking death, having no  hope. Pity  filled his heart  and  great 
line 41143=>wonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke. He clenched 
line 41144=>his hand. She should not die, so fair, so desperate At  least she should not 
line 41145=>
line 41146=>####-die alone, unaided. 
line 41147=>     The face of their enemy was not turned towards him, but still he hardly 
line 41148=>dared  to move,  dreading lest  the deadly eyes should fall  on him. Slowly, 
line 41149=>slowly he began to crawl aside; but the Black  Captain, in doubt  and malice 
line 41150=>intent upon the woman before him, heeded him no more than a worm in the 
line 41151=>mud. 
line 41152=>     Suddenly the great beast beat its hideous  wings, and the  wind of them 
line 41153=>was foul.  Again it  leaped into the  air, and then  swiftly fell  down upon 
line 41154=>Jowyn, shrieking, striking with beak and claw.  
line 41155=>     Still  she  did  not blench:  maiden of  the Rohirrim, child of  kings,  
line 41156=>slender but as a steel -blade, fair but terrible.  A  swift stroke she dealt, 
line 41157=>skilled and deadly.  The outstretched neck she clove asunder,  and the  hewn 
line 41158=>head fell like a stone.  Backward she sprang  as the huge  shape  crashed to 
line 41159=>ruin, vast wings outspread,  crumpled on the  earth; and with  its fall  the 
line 41160=>shadow passed  away. A light  fell about her,  and  her  hair  shone  in the 
line 41161=>sunrise. 
line 41162=>     Out of the  wreck rose the Black  Rider, tall and threatening, towering 
line 41163=>above her. With  a cry of hatred that stung the very ears  like venom he let 
line 41164=>fall  his mace. Her  shield was  shivered  in  many pieces, and her  arm was 
line 41165=>broken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent  over  her like  a cloud, and his 
line 41166=>eyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill. 
line 41167=>     But suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his 
line 41168=>stroke went  wide,  driving into the ground.  Merry's  sword had stabbed him 
line 41169=>from behind, shearing  through  the black mantle, and passing up beneath the 
line 41170=>hauberk had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee. 
line 41171=>     'Jowyn! Jowyn!'  cried  Merry.  Then tottering, struggling up, with her  
line 41172=>last strength she drove her sword between  crown and  mantle, as  the  great 
line 41173=>shoulders bowed before her. The sword broke sparkling into many shards.  The 
line 41174=>crown rolled away with  a clang. Jowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe. But 
line 41175=>lo! the mantle and hauberk were empty. Shapeless they lay now on the ground, 
line 41176=>torn and tumbled; and a cry went up into the shuddering air, and faded  to a  
line 41177=>shrill wailing, passing with  the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died,  
line 41178=>and was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world. 
line 41179=>     And there stood Meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain, blinking 
line 41180=>like an owl in  the daylight, for  tears blinded him; and through  a mist he 
line 41181=>looked on Jowyn's fair head, as  she lay and did not move; and  he looked on 
line 41182=>the face of the king, fallen in the midst  of his glory, For Snowmane in his 
line 41183=>
line 41184=>####-agony had rolled away from him again; yet he was the bane of his master. 
line 41185=>     Then  Merry stooped and  lifted his hand to kiss  it,  and  lo! Thjoden 
line 41186=>opened  his eyes, and they were clear, and he spoke in a quiet voice  though  
line 41187=>laboured. 
line 41188=>     'Farewell, Master Holbytla!'  he said. 'My body  is broken. I go to  my 
line 41189=>fathers.  And  even  in their mighty  company  I shall not now be ashamed. I  
line 41190=>felled the black serpent. A grim morn, and a glad day, and a golden sunset!' 
line 41191=>     Merry could  not speak, bu t wept anew. 'Forgive me,  lord,' he  said at 
line 41192=>last, 'if  I broke  your command, and  yet have done no more in your service 
line 41193=>than to weep at our parting.' 
line 41194=>     The old king smiled. 'Grieve not! It is forgiven. Great  heart will not 
line 41195=>be denied. Live now  in blessedness; and when  you  sit  in peace with  your  
line 41196=>pipe, think  of  me! For  never now shall I  sit with you in Meduseld,  as I 
line 41197=>promised, or listen to your herb-lore.' He closed his eyes, and Merry  bowed  
line 41198=>beside him. Presently  he spoke again. 'Where is  Jomer? For my eyes darken, 
line 41199=>and I would see him ere I go.  He must be  king after  me. And  I would send  
line 41200=>word to Jowyn. She, she would not have me leave her, and now I shall not see 
line 41201=>her again, dearer than daughter.' 
line 41202=>     'Lord,  lord,' began Merry brokenly, 'she  is--';  but  at that  moment 
line 41203=>there  was  a  great clamour, and all  about  them horns and  trumpets  were 
line 41204=>blowing. Merry looked round:  he had forgotten  the war, and  all  the world 
line 41205=>beside, and many hours it  seemed since the king rode to his fall, though in 
line 41206=>truth it was only a little while. But now he saw that they were in danger of 
line 41207=>being caught  in  the  very midst  of the great  battle that would  soon  be 
line 41208=>joined. 
line 41209=>     New forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the River;  and  
line 41210=>from  u nder the walls came  the  legions of Morgul; and  from  the southward 
line 41211=>fields came footmen of Harad with horsemen before them, and behind them 
line 41212=>rose 
line 41213=>the huge backs of the mymakil with war-towers  upon them. But  northward the 
line 41214=>white crest of Jomer led the great front of  the Rohirrim which he had again 
line 41215=>gathered and marshalled;  and out of the City  came all the  strength of men 
line 41216=>that  was in  it, and  the silver swan of Dol Amroth was borne  in  the van, 
line 41217=>driving the enemy from the Gate. 
line 41218=>     For  a  moment  the thought flitted through  Merry's  mind:  'Where  is 
line 41219=>Gandalf? Is he not here? Could he not  have saved the  king and Jowyn?'  But 
line 41220=>thereupon Jomer rode  up  in haste, and with him  came the  knights  of  the 
line 41221=>
line 41222=>####-household that still lived and had now mastered their horses. They looked in 
line 41223=>wonder  at  the carcase of the fell  beast that lay there:  and their steeds 
line 41224=>would  not go near. But Jomer leaped from the  saddle, and  grief and dismay 
line 41225=>fell upon him as he came to the king's side and stood there in silence. 
line 41226=>     Then one of the knights took the king's banner from the hand of Guthlbf 
line 41227=>the banner -bearer who  lay  dead, and he lifted it up. Slowly Thjoden opened 
line 41228=>his eyes. Seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to Jomer. 
line 41229=>     'Hail, King of  the Mark!' he said.  'Ride now  to  victory!  Bid Jowyn 
line 41230=>farewell!' And so he died,  and knew  not that Jowyn lay near him. And those 
line 41231=>who stood by wept, crying: 'Thjoden King! Thjoden King!' 
line 41232=>     But Jomer said to them: 
line 41233=>     Mourn not overmuch! Mighty was the fallen, 
line 41234=>     meet was his ending. When his mound is raised, 
line 41235=>     women then shall weep. War now calls us! 
line 41236=>     Yet  he himself wept  as he spoke.  'Let  his knights remain  here,' he 
line 41237=>said; 'and bear his body in honour from the field, lest the battle ride over  
line 41238=>it! Yea, and all these other of the king's men that lie here.' And he looked 
line 41239=>at  the  slain,  recalling their  names. Then suddenly he beheld  his sister  
line 41240=>Jowyn as she lay, and he knew her. He stood a moment as a man who is 
line 41241=>pierced 
line 41242=>in the midst of a cry by  an arrow through the heart;  and then his face went 
line 41243=>deathly white;  and a cold  fury rose in him, so that  all speech failed him 
line 41244=>for a while. A fey mood took him. 
line 41245=>     'Jowyn,  Jowyn!'  he  cried at last:  'Jowyn,  how come you  here? What 
line 41246=>madness or devilry is this? Death, death, death! Death take us all!' 
line 41247=>     Then without taking  counsel or waiting for the approach of  the men of 
line 41248=>the City, he spurred headlong back  to the front of the great host, and blew 
line 41249=>a horn, and cried  aloud for  the onset. Over the field rang his clear voice 
line 41250=>calling: 'Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world's ending!' 
line 41251=>     And with that the host  began to move. But the Rohirrim sang  no  more. 
line 41252=>Death  they cried with one voice loud and terrible, and gathering speed  like 
line 41253=>a  great tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed, roaring 
line 41254=>away southwards.  
line 41255=>     And still  Meriadoc  the hobbit stood there blinking through  his tears 
line 41256=>and no one spoke to him, indeed none seemed to heed him. He brushed away 
line 41257=>the 
line 41258=>tears, and stooped to pick up the green shield that Jowyn had given him; and 
line 41259=>
line 41260=>####-he slung it at his back.  Then he looked for his sword that he had let fall; 
line 41261=>for even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use 
line 41262=>his left hand. And behold! there  lay his weapon, but the blade  was smoking  
line 41263=>like a dry branch that has been thrust in  a fire; and as  he watched it, it 
line 41264=>writhed and withered and was consumed. 
line 41265=>     So passed the sword  of the Barrow-downs, work of Westernesse. But glad 
line 41266=>would  he have been  to know its fate who wrought  it slowly long ago in the  
line 41267=>North-kingdom when the D®nedain were young,  and chief among  their foes 
line 41268=>was 
line 41269=>the dread realm of Angmar and its sorcerer king. No other blade, not  though 
line 41270=>mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound  so bitter, 
line 41271=>cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to 
line 41272=>his will. 
line 41273=>     Men now raised the  king, and laying cloaks upon  spear -truncheons they 
line 41274=>made shift to bear him away towards the City; and others lifted Jowyn gently 
line 41275=>up and bore her after him.  But  the  men of the king's household they could 
line 41276=>not yet bring from  the  field; for seven of the king's knights  had  fallen 
line 41277=>there, and Djorwine their chief was among them. So they laid them apart from 
line 41278=>their foes and the fell beast and set spears about them. And afterwards when 
line 41279=>all was over men returned  and  made a fire there  and burned the carcase of 
line 41280=>the beast; but for Snowmane  they dug a grave and set up a stone  upon which 
line 41281=>was carved in the tongues of Gondor and the Mark: 
line 41282=>     Faithful servant yet master's bane 
line 41283=>     Lightfoot's foal, swift Snowmane. 
line 41284=>     Green and long  grew the grass  on  Snowmane's Howe, but ever black and 
line 41285=>bare was the ground where the beast was burned. 
line 41286=>     Now slowly and sadly Merry  walked beside the bearers,  and he gave  no 
line 41287=>more  heed to  the battle.  He was weary and  full  of  pain, and  his limbs 
line 41288=>trembled as  with  a chill. A great  rain came out of the Sea, and it seemed 
line 41289=>that all things wept for Thjoden and  Jowyn, quenching the fires in the City 
line 41290=>with grey tears.  It was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the 
line 41291=>men of Gondor  approaching. Imrahil,  Prince of Dol Amroth, rode up and 
line 41292=>drew 
line 41293=>rein before them. 
line 41294=>     'What burden do you bear, Men of Rohan?' he cried. 
line 41295=>     'Thjoden King,' they answered. 'He is dead. But Jomer King now rides in  
line 41296=>the battle: he with the white crest in the wind.' 
line 41297=>
line 41298=>####-     Then the prince went from his horse, and knelt by the bier in honour of 
line 41299=>the  king and  his  great onset; and  he wept. And  rising he looked then on 
line 41300=>Jowyn and  was amazed. 'Surely,  here  is a  woman?' he said. 'Have even the 
line 41301=>women of the Rohirrim come to war in our need?' 
line 41302=>     'Nay!  One only,'  they  answered.  'The Lady Jowyn is  she, sister  of 
line 41303=>Jomer; and we knew naught of her riding  until this hour, and greatly we rue 
line 41304=>it.' 
line 41305=>     Then the prince seeing her beauty, though her face  was pale  and cold, 
line 41306=>touched her hand as he bent to look more  closely on her. 'Men of Rohan!' he 
line 41307=>cried. 'Are there no leeches among you? She is hurt to the death  maybe, but 
line 41308=>I deem that  she yet lives.' And  he held the bright-burnished vambrace that 
line 41309=>was upon his arm before her cold tips, and behold! a little mist was laid on 
line 41310=>it hardly to be seen. 
line 41311=>     'Haste now is needed,'  he said, and he sent one riding back swiftly to 
line 41312=>the City to bring aid. But he bowing low to the fallen, bade  them farewell, 
line 41313=>and mounting rode away into battle. 
line 41314=>     And now  the  fighting waxed furious on the fields of the Pelennor; and 
line 41315=>the din of arms rose upon  high, with  the crying of men and the neighing of 
line 41316=>horses. Horns were blown  and trumpets  were  braying, and  the mymakil were 
line 41317=>bellowing as they  were goaded to war. Under the south walls of the City the  
line 41318=>footmen of Gondor now  drove against the legions  of Morgul that were  still  
line 41319=>gathered there in strength. But the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of 
line 41320=>Jomer:  H®rin the Tall Warden of  the Keys, and the Lord of  Lossarnach, and 
line 41321=>Hirluin of the Green Hills, and Prince Imrahil the fair with his knights all 
line 41322=>about him. 
line 41323=>     Not too  soon came  their  aid to  the Rohirrim; for fortune had turned 
line 41324=>against Jomer,  and his fury had betrayed him.  The great wrath of his onset 
line 41325=>had  utterly  overthrown the front of  his enemies, and  great wedges of his 
line 41326=>Riders had passed clear through  the ranks of  the   Southrons,  discomfiting 
line 41327=>their  horsemen and riding their footmen to ruin.  But  wherever the mymakil 
line 41328=>came  there the horses would not go, but  blenched and swerved away; and the 
line 41329=>great  monsters were  unfought, and  stood  like towers of defence,  and the 
line 41330=>Haradrim rallied about them. And if the Rohirrim at  their onset were thrice 
line 41331=>outnumbered by  the Haradrim alone,  soon their case  became  worse; for new 
line 41332=>strength came  now streaming to the field  out of  Osgiliath. There they had 
line 41333=>been mustered for the sack of  the City and the rape of Gondor,  waiting  on  
line 41334=>the call of their Captain. He  now was destroyed; but Gothmog the lieutenant 
line 41335=>
line 41336=>####-of  Morgul had flung them into the fray; Easterlings  with axes, and Variags 
line 41337=>of  Khand. Southrons  in  scarlet, and  out  of  Far  Harad  black  men  like 
line 41338=>half-trolls with white eyes and red tongues. Some now hastened up behind the 
line 41339=>Rohirrim, others  held westward to hold off the forces of Gondor and prevent 
line 41340=>their joining with Rohan. 
line 41341=>     It was even as the day thus began to turn against Gondor and their hope 
line 41342=>wavered that a new cry went up in the City, it being  then midmorning, and a 
line 41343=>great wind blowing,  and the rain flying north, and the sun shining. In that 
line 41344=>clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fear, and their last 
line 41345=>hope left them. 
line 41346=>     For Anduin, from the bend at  the Harlond, so flowed that from the City 
line 41347=>men  could look down it lengthwise for  some leagues,  and  the  far-sighted  
line 41348=>could  see  any  ships  that  approached. And looking thither they cried  in  
line 41349=>dismay; for black against the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up 
line 41350=>on the wind: dromunds, and  ships  of great draught with many oars, and with 
line 41351=>black sails bellying in the breeze. 
line 41352=>     'The Corsairs of Umbar!' men shouted. 'The Corsairs of Umbar! Look! The 
line 41353=>Corsairs of Umbar  are  coming!  So  Belfalas is  taken, and the  Ethir, and 
line 41354=>Lebennin is gone. The Corsairs are upon us! It is the last stroke of doom!' 
line 41355=>     And some without order, for none could he found to command them  in the 
line 41356=>City,  ran to  the bells and tolled the alarm;  and  some blew the  trumpets 
line 41357=>sounding the retreat. 'Back to the walls!' they  cried. 'Back to the  walls!  
line 41358=>Come back to the City before all are overwhelmed!' But the  wind  that  sped 
line 41359=>the ships blew all their clamour away. 
line 41360=>     The Rohirrim indeed had no  need  of news or  alarm.  All too well they 
line 41361=>could  see for themselves the black sails. For Jomer was now scarcely a mile  
line 41362=>from the Harlond, and a great press of  his first  foes was between  him and 
line 41363=>the haven  there, while new  foes came swirling behind, cutting him off from 
line 41364=>the Prince. Now he looked to the River,  and hope died in his heart, and the 
line 41365=>wind  that he had blessed  he  now  called accursed. But the hosts of Mordor  
line 41366=>were enheartened, and filled  with a new lust  and fury they came yelling to 
line 41367=>the onset. 
line 41368=>     Stern now  was Jomer's mood, and  his mind clear again. He let blow the 
line 41369=>horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither; for he thought 
line 41370=>to make a great shield-wall at the last, and stand, and  fight there on foot 
line 41371=>till all fell, and do deeds of song on the fields of Pelennor, though no man 
line 41372=>should be left in the West to remember the last King of the Mark. So he rode  
line 41373=>
line 41374=>####-to  a green hillock and  there  set  his banner,  and  the  White Horse  ran 
line 41375=>rippling in the wind. 
line 41376=>     Out of doubt, out of dark to the day's rising 
line 41377=>     I came singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. 
line 41378=>     To hope's end I rode and to heart's breaking: 
line 41379=>     Now for wrath, now for ruin and a red nightfall! 
line 41380=>     These staves  he spoke, yet he laughed as  he  said them. For once more 
line 41381=>lust of battle was on him; and he was still unscathed, and he was young, and 
line 41382=>he was king:  the  lord  of a  fell  people. And lo! even  as he  laughed at 
line 41383=>despair he looked  out  again on the black ships, and he lifted up his sword 
line 41384=>to defy them. 
line 41385=>     And then wonder took him, and a great joy; and he cast  his sword up in 
line 41386=>the sunlight  and sang as he caught it. And all eyes followed his gaze,  and 
line 41387=>behold!  upon  the  foremost  ship  a great  standard  broke,  and the  wind 
line 41388=>displayed it as she turned towards the Harlond. There flowered a White Tree, 
line 41389=>and that  was for Gondor; but Seven Stars were  about it,  and  a high crown 
line 41390=>above it,  the  signs of  Elendil  that no lord had  borne  for years beyond 
line 41391=>count. And the  stars flamed in the  sunlight, for they were wrought of gems 
line 41392=>by Arwen daughter of Elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it 
line 41393=>was wrought of mithril and gold. 
line 41394=>     Thus came Aragorn son of Arathorn, Elessar, Isildur's heir, out  of the 
line 41395=>Paths of the Dead, borne upon a wind from the Sea to the  kingdom of Gondor; 
line 41396=>and the mirth  of the Rohirrim was a  torrent  of laughter and a flashing of 
line 41397=>swords, and the  joy and wonder of the  City  was a music of trumpets and  a  
line 41398=>ringing of bells. But the hosts of Mordor wer e seized with bewilderment, and 
line 41399=>a  great  wizardry  it seemed to  them that their own ships should be filled 
line 41400=>with their foes; and a black dread  fell on them, knowing  that the tides of 
line 41401=>fate had turned against them and their doom was at hand. 
line 41402=>     East rode the  knights of  Dol Amroth driving the  enemy  before  them: 
line 41403=>troll-men and Variags  and orcs that hated  the sunlight. South strode Jomer  
line 41404=>and men fled  before his face, and  they were caught between the  hammer and 
line 41405=>the anvil. For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the Harlond and 
line 41406=>swept north like  a storm. There  came Legolas, and  Gimli wielding his axe, 
line 41407=>and Halbarad with the standard, and Elladan  and Elrohir with stars on their 
line 41408=>brow,  and the  dour-handed D®nedain, Rangers of the North,  leading a great 
line 41409=>valour of the folk of Lebennin  and Lamedon and  the fiefs of the South. But 
line 41410=>before all went Aragorn with the Flame of the West, And®ril  like a new fire 
line 41411=>
line 41412=>####-kindled, Narsil  re-forged  as deadly as of old: and upon his  brow  was the 
line 41413=>Star of Elendil. 
line 41414=>     And so at length Jomer and Aragorn met in  the midst of the battle, and 
line 41415=>they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad. 
line 41416=>     'Thus we  meet again, though  all the hosts of Mordor lay between  us,' 
line 41417=>said Aragorn. 'Did I not say so at the Hornburg?' 
line 41418=>     'So you spoke,' said Jomer, 'but hope oft deceives, and I knew not then 
line 41419=>that you were a man foresighted. Yet twice blessed is help unlooked for, and  
line 41420=>never was a meeting of friends more joyful.' And they  clasped hand in hand. 
line 41421=>'Nor  indeed more timely,'  said Jomer. 'You come none too soon,  my friend. 
line 41422=>Much loss and sorrow has befallen us.' 
line 41423=>     'Then let us avenge it, ere  we speak  of it!'  said Aragorn,  and they 
line 41424=>rode back to battle together. 
line 41425=>     Hard  fighting and long  labour they had  still; for the Southrons were 
line 41426=>bold  men and grim, and fierce in despair; and  the Easterlings  were strong 
line 41427=>and war-hardened and asked for no quarter. And so in this place and that, by 
line 41428=>burned  homestead or  barn,  upon hillock or mound, under wa ll or on  field,  
line 41429=>still they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away. 
line 41430=>     Then the Sun went at last behind Mindolluin and filled all the sky with 
line 41431=>a great  burning, so  that  the hills and the mountains were  dyed  as  with 
line 41432=>blood; fire  glowed in  the  River, and the grass of the Pelennor lay red in 
line 41433=>the nightfall. And in that hour the great Battle of  the field of Gondor was 
line 41434=>over; and not one living foe was left within  the circuit of the Rammas. All 
line 41435=>were slain  save those who fled  to die, or to drown  in the red foam of the 
line 41436=>River. Few ever came  eastward to Morgul or Mordor; and  to the land of  the 
line 41437=>Haradrim came only a tale from far off: a rumour of  the wrath and terror of 
line 41438=>Gondor. 
line 41439=>     Aragorn and  Jomer and Imrahil rode back towards  the Gate of the City,  
line 41440=>and they  were now weary beyond joy  or sorrow. These three were  unscathed, 
line 41441=>for such was their  fortune and the skill  and might of their  arms, and few 
line 41442=>indeed had dared  to abide them or  look on their faces in the hour of their 
line 41443=>wrath. But many others were hurt or  maimed or dead upon the field. The axes 
line 41444=>hewed Forlong  as he fought  alone and unhorsed; and both Duilin of Morthond 
line 41445=>and his  brother  were  trampled  to death  when they assailed the  mymakil, 
line 41446=>leading  their  bowmen  close  to shoot at the eyes of the monsters. Neither 
line 41447=>Hirluin the  fair would return to Pinnath Gelin, nor Grimbold  to Grimslade,  
line 41448=>nor Halbarad  to  the Northlands,  dour -handed  Ranger.  No few  had fallen, 
line 41449=>
line 41450=>####-renowned or nameless, captain or  soldier; for it was a great battle and the 
line 41451=>full count of it  no tale has told. So long afterward a maker in Rohan  said 
line 41452=>in his song of the Mounds of Mundburg: 
line 41453=>     We heard of the horns in the hills ringing, 
line 41454=>     the swords shining in the South -kingdom. 
line 41455=>     Steeds went striding to the Stoningland 
line 41456=>     as wind in the morning. War was kindled. 
line 41457=>     There Thjoden fell, Thengling mighty, 
line 41458=>     to his golden halls and green pastures 
line 41459=>     in the Northern fields never returning, 
line 41460=>     high lord of the host. Harding and Guthlbf 
line 41461=>     D®nhere and Djorwine, doughty Grimbold, 
line 41462=>     Herefara and Herubrand, Horn and Fastred, 
line 41463=>     fought and fell there in a far country: 
line 41464=>     in the Mounds of Mundburg under mould they lie  
line 41465=>     with their league-fellows, lords of Gondor. 
line 41466=>     Neither Hirluin the Fair to the hills by the sea, 
line 41467=>     nor Forlong the old to the flowering vales 
line 41468=>     ever, to Arnach, to his own country 
line 41469=>     returned in triumph; nor the tall bowmen, 
line 41470=>     Derufin and Duilin, to their dark waters, 
line 41471=>     meres of Morthond under mountain -shadows. 
line 41472=>     Death in the morning and at day's ending  
line 41473=>     lords took and lowly. Long now they sleep 
line 41474=>     under grass in Gondor by the Great River. 
line 41475=>     Grey now as tears, gleaming silver, 
line 41476=>     red then it rolled, roaring water: 
line 41477=>     foam dyed with blood flamed a t sunset; 
line 41478=>     as beacons mountains burned at evening; 
line 41479=>     red fell the dew in Rammas Echor. 
line 41480=> 
line 41481=>
line 41482=>####- 
line 41483=>
line 41484=>Chapter 7. The Pyre of Denethor 
line 41485=>
line 41486=> 
line 41487=> 
line 41488=>     When the dark shadow at the Gate withdrew Gandalf still sat motionless.  
line 41489=>But Pippin rose to his  feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him; 
line 41490=>and  he stood listening to  the horns, and it seemed to  him that they would 
line 41491=>break his  heart  with joy. And  never in after years could  he  hear a horn 
line 41492=>blown in the distance  without tears starting in  his eyes. But now suddenly 
line 41493=>his errand  returned  to  his memory,  and  he  ran forward.  At that moment 
line 41494=>Gandalf stirred and spoke to Shadowfax, and was  about to  ride through  the 
line 41495=>Gate. 
line 41496=>     'Gandalf, Gandalf! ' cried Pippin, and Shadowfax halted. 
line 41497=>     'What are you  doing here?'  said Gandalf. 'Is it not a law in the City 
line 41498=>that  those who  wear the black and  silver must stay in the Citadel, unless 
line 41499=>their lord gives them leave?' 
line 41500=>     'He has,' said Pippin. 'He sent me away. But I am frightened. Something 
line 41501=>terrible may happen up  there. The  Lord is  out of his  mind, I think. I am 
line 41502=>afraid he will kill himself, and kill Faramir too. Can't you do something?' 
line 41503=>     Gandalf looked through the  gaping  Gate, and already  on the fields he 
line 41504=>heard the gathering sound of  battle. He clenched his  hand. 'I must go ' he 
line 41505=>said. 'The Black Rider is abroad, and he will yet  bring ruin on  us. I have 
line 41506=>no time.' 
line 41507=>     'But Faramir!' cried Pippin.  'He is  not dead, and they will  burn him 
line 41508=>alive, if someone does not stop them.' 
line 41509=>     'Burn him alive?' said Gandalf. 'What is this tale? Be quick!' 
line 41510=>     'Denethor  has gone  to  the  Tombs,'  said Pippin, 'and  he has  taken 
line 41511=>Faramir, and  he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are 
line 41512=>to make a pyre and  burn him on it, and Faramir as well. And he has sent men 
line 41513=>to fetch  wood and  oil.  And I have told Beregond, but I'm afraid  he won't  
line 41514=>dare  to  leave his post: he is on  guard. And what can  he  do  anyway?' So 
line 41515=>Pippin poured out  his tale, reaching up  and  touching  Gandalf's knee with 
line 41516=>trembling hands. 'Can't you save Faramir?' 
line 41517=>     'Maybe I can,' said Gandalf;  'but  if  I do, then  others will die,  I 
line 41518=>fear. Well, I must come, since no  other  help can  reach  him. But evil and 
line 41519=>sorrow will come of this. Even in the heart of our stronghold the Enemy  has 
line 41520=>power to strike us: for his will it is that is at work.' 
line 41521=>
line 41522=>####-     Then  having made up  his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up Pippin 
line 41523=>and setting him before him, he turned Shadowfax with a word. Up the climbing 
line 41524=>streets of Minas  Tirith they clattered, while the noise of  war rose behind 
line 41525=>them. Everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread, seizing their 
line 41526=>weapons, crying  one to another: 'Rohan  has come!'  Captains were shouting, 
line 41527=>companies were mustering; many already were marching down to the Gate. 
line 41528=>     They  met  the Prince Imrahil,  and  he called  to them: 'Whither  now, 
line 41529=>Mithrandir?  The Rohirrim are  fighting  on  the  fields  of Gondor! We must  
line 41530=>gather all the strength that we can find.' 
line 41531=>     'You will need every man and more,' said  Gandalf.  'Make  all haste. I 
line 41532=>will come when I can. But I  have  an errand to the  Lord Denethor that will 
line 41533=>not wait. Take command in the Lord's absence!' 
line 41534=>     They passed on; and  as they climbed and drew near to the Citadel  they 
line 41535=>felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morning  
line 41536=>far away, a light growing in the southern sky. But it brought little hope to 
line 41537=>them, not knowing what evil lay before them, fearing to come too late. 
line 41538=>     'Darkness is passing,' said Gandalf, 'but it still lies heavy  on  this 
line 41539=>City.' 
line 41540=>     At the  gate  of the  Citadel they found no guard.  'Then Beregond  has 
line 41541=>gone,' said  Pippin  more hopefully. They turned away and hastened along the 
line 41542=>road to  the Closed Door. It stood wide open,  and the porter lay before it. 
line 41543=>He was slain and his key had been taken. 
line 41544=>     'Work of the Enemy!' said Gandalf. 'Such  deeds he loves: friend at war 
line 41545=>with friend; loyalty divided in  confusion of hearts.' Now he dismounted and 
line 41546=>bade  Shadowfax return to his stable. 'For, my friend,' he said, 'you and  I 
line 41547=>should have ridden to  the fields long  ago, but other matters delay me. Yet 
line 41548=>come swiftly if I call!' 
line 41549=>     They passed the Door  and walked on down the steep winding  road. Light 
line 41550=>was  growing, and the tall columns and carven  figures beside the  way  went 
line 41551=>slowly by like grey ghosts.  
line 41552=>     Suddenly the silence was broken,  and  they  heard below them cries and  
line 41553=>the ringing of swords: such  sounds as had not been  heard in  the  hallowed 
line 41554=>places since the building of  the City. At  last they came to Rath Dnnen and 
line 41555=>hastened towards the  House of the Stewards,  looming in the  twilight under  
line 41556=>its great dome. 
line 41557=>     'Stay!  Stay!'  cried Gandalf,  springing  forward  to the stone  stair 
line 41558=>before the door. 'Stay this madness!' 
line 41559=>
line 41560=>####-     For there were  the servants of  Denethor with  swords and  torches  in 
line 41561=>their hands; but  alone in the  porch upon  the topmost step stood Beregond, 
line 41562=>clad in the black and silver of  the  Guard;  and he held  the door  against 
line 41563=>them. Two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with 
line 41564=>their blood;  and the others cursed  him, calling him outlaw and  traitor to 
line 41565=>his master. 
line 41566=>     Even  as Gandalf and  Pippin  ran forward,  they heard from  within the 
line 41567=>house of the dead  the voice of Denethor crying: 'Haste, haste! Do as I have 
line 41568=>bidden!  Slay me this renegade! Or must I do so myself?' Thereupon  the door  
line 41569=>which Beregond held  shut  with  his left  hand was wrenched open, and there 
line 41570=>behind him stood the Lord of the City, tall and fell; a light like flame was 
line 41571=>in his eyes, a nd he held a drawn sword. 
line 41572=>     But Gandalf sprang up  the steps, and  the men fell  back from  him and 
line 41573=>covered their eyes; for his  coming  was like the incoming of a  white light 
line 41574=>into  a dark place, and he came with great anger. He lifted up his hand, and 
line 41575=>in  the very stroke, the sword of Denethor flew  up and left  his  grasp and 
line 41576=>fell  behind him in the shadows of the house; and  Denethor stepped backward 
line 41577=>before Gandalf as one amazed. 
line 41578=>     'What is this, my lord?' said the wizard. 'The houses  of the  dead are 
line 41579=>no  places for the living.  And why  do men  fight here in the  Hallows when 
line 41580=>there  is  war enough before  the  Gate? Or has our  Enemy come even to Rath 
line 41581=>Dnnen?' 
line 41582=>     'Since  when  has  the Lord  of  Gondor been answerable to thee?'  said 
line 41583=>Denethor.  'Or may I not command my own servants?' 
line 41584=>     'You may,' said Gandalf.  'But others may contest your will, when it is 
line 41585=>turned to madness and evil. Where is your son, Faramir?' 
line 41586=>     'He lies  within,' said Denethor, 'burning, already burning. They  have 
line 41587=>set a fire in his flesh. But soon all shall be burned. The  West has failed. 
line 41588=>It shall  all  go up in a  great fire, and all shall be  ended. Ash! Ash and 
line 41589=>smoke blown away on the wind!' 
line 41590=>     Then  Gandalf  seeing the madness  that was on  him feared that he  had 
line 41591=>already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with Beregond and Pippin 
line 41592=>behind him, while Denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. 
line 41593=>But  there they found Faramir,  still dreaming in  his fever, lying upon the 
line 41594=>table. Wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all  was drenched 
line 41595=>with oil, even the garments of Faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire 
line 41596=>had been set to the fuel. Then Gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in 
line 41597=>
line 41598=>####-him; even as the light of  his  power was hidden u nder his  grey mantle.  He 
line 41599=>leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down 
line 41600=>again, and bore him towards the door. But as he did  so  Faramir moaned  and 
line 41601=>called on his father in his dream. 
line 41602=>     Denethor started as one waking from a trance, and the flame died in his 
line 41603=>eyes,  and he wept; and he said: 'Do not take my son from me!  He calls  for  
line 41604=>me.' 
line 41605=>     'He calls,' said Gandalf, 'but you cannot come to him yet.  For he must  
line 41606=>seek healing on the threshold of death, and maybe find it no t. Whereas  your  
line 41607=>part is to go out to  the battle of your City, where maybe death awaits you. 
line 41608=>This you know in your heart.' 
line 41609=>     'He will not wake again,' said Denethor. 'Battle is vain. Why should we 
line 41610=>wish to live longer? Why should we not go to death side by side?' 
line 41611=>     'Authority is not given to you, Steward of Gondor, to order the hour of 
line 41612=>your  death,'  answered  Gandalf.  'And only the  heathen  kings, under  the 
line 41613=>domination of the Dark Power, did  thus,  slaying  themselves  in pride  and 
line 41614=>despair, murdering their kin to ease their  own death.' Then passing through 
line 41615=>the door he took  Faramir from the deadly house and laid him  on the bier on  
line 41616=>which he had been brought, and which had now been set in the porch. Denethor  
line 41617=>followed him, and  stood trembling,  looking with longing on the face of his 
line 41618=>son. And for a moment, while all were silent and still, watching the Lord in 
line 41619=>his throes, he wavered. 
line 41620=>     'Come!' said  Gandalf.  'We  are needed. There is much that you can yet 
line 41621=>do.' 
line 41622=>     Then suddenly Denethor laughed . He stood up  tall  and proud again, and 
line 41623=>stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his 
line 41624=>head  had lain.  Then coming to the  doorway he drew aside the covering, and 
line 41625=>lo! he had between his hands  a palantnr. And as he held it up, it seemed to 
line 41626=>those that  looked on that the  globe began to  glow with an inner flame, so 
line 41627=>that the lean face of the Lord was lit as with a red fire, and it seemed cut 
line 41628=>out of hard stone, sharp with black shadows, noble, proud, and terrible. His 
line 41629=>eyes glittered. 
line 41630=>     'Pride and despair!' he cried.  'Didst thou  think that the eyes of the 
line 41631=>White  Tower were blind? Nay, I have seen more than thou knowest, Grey 
line 41632=>Fool. 
line 41633=>For  thy hope is  but ignorance. Go then and labour in healing! Go forth and  
line 41634=>fight! Vanity. For a little space you may triumph  on the field, for a  day. 
line 41635=>
line 41636=>####-But against the Power that now arises there is no victory. To this City only 
line 41637=>the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched. All the East is moving. 
line 41638=>And even now the  wind of thy  hope cheats thee and wafts up Anduin a  fleet 
line 41639=>with black  sails. The West has failed. It is  time for all  to  depart  who 
line 41640=>would not be slaves.' 
line 41641=>     'Such  counsels  will make the  Enemy's victory  certain  indeed,' said 
line 41642=>Gandalf. 
line 41643=>     'Hope on then!' laughed Denethor. 'Do  I not know thee, Mithrandir? Thy  
line 41644=>hope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every throne,  north, south, or  
line 41645=>west. I  have read  thy  mind  and  its  policies.  Do I  not  know that you  
line 41646=>commanded this halfling here to keep silence? That you brought him hither to 
line 41647=>be a spy  within  my  very  chamber?  And yet  in our speech together I have 
line 41648=>learned  the names and purpose of all thy companions. So! With the left hand 
line 41649=>thou wouldst use me  for a little while as a shield against Mordor, and with 
line 41650=>the right bring up this Ranger of the North to supplant me. 
line 41651=>     'But  I say to thee, Gandalf Mithrandir, I will not  be  thy tool! I am 
line 41652=>Steward of the  House  of Anbrion.  I will not step  down  to be  the dotard 
line 41653=>chamberlain of an upstart. Even  were his claim proved to me, still he comes 
line 41654=>but of the line of Isildur. I will not bow to such a  one, last of  a ragged 
line 41655=>house long bereft of lordship and dignity.' 
line 41656=>     'What then would  you have,' said Gandalf, 'if your will could have its 
line 41657=>way?' 
line 41658=>     'I would have things as they were in all the days of my life,' answered 
line 41659=>Denethor,  'and in the days of  my  longfathers before me: to be the Lord of 
line 41660=>this City in peace,  and leave my chair to  a son after me, who would be his 
line 41661=>own master and no wizard's pupil. But if doom denies this to me, then I will 
line 41662=>have naught: neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated.' 
line 41663=>     'To me it would  not seem that a Steward who  faithfully surrenders his 
line 41664=>charge is diminished in love  or in honour,' said Gandalf. 'And at the least 
line 41665=>you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt.' 
line 41666=>     At those words Denethor's eyes flamed again, and taking the Stone under  
line 41667=>his arm  he drew a knife and  strode towards the  bier. But  Beregond sprang 
line 41668=>forward and set himself before Faramir. 
line 41669=>     'So!' cried Denethor. 'Thou hadst  already  stolen  half my son's love. 
line 41670=>Now thou stealest the hearts of  my knights also, so that they rob me wholly  
line 41671=>of my son at the last. But in this at least thou shalt not defy  my will: to 
line 41672=>rule my own end.' 
line 41673=>
line 41674=>####-     'Come  hither!'  he cried  to his servants. 'Come,  if you are  not all 
line 41675=>recreant!'  Then two of them ran up the steps to  him. Swiftly he snatched a  
line 41676=>torch from the hand of  one  and  sprang back into the house. Before Gandalf 
line 41677=>could hinder him he  thrust the brand amid the fuel, and at once it crackled 
line 41678=>and roared into flame. 
line 41679=>     Then Denethor  leaped upon  the  table, and  standing there wreathed in 
line 41680=>fire and smoke he took up the staff  of his stewardship that lay at his feet 
line 41681=>and broke  it on his  knee.  Casting the pieces into  the blaze he bowed and 
line 41682=>laid himself  on  the table, clasping the palantnr with both hands upon  his 
line 41683=>breast. And  it was said that ever after, if  any man  looked in that Stone, 
line 41684=>unless he had a great strength of will to  turn it to other purpose, he  saw 
line 41685=>only two aged hands withering in flame. 
line 41686=>     Gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away  and closed the  door. 
line 41687=>For  a  while  he stood in thought,  silent  upon the threshold, while those 
line 41688=>outside heard the greedy roaring of  the fire within. And then Denethor gave 
line 41689=>a great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor was ever again seen by mortal 
line 41690=>men. 
line 41691=>     'So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion,' said Gandalf: Then he turned to 
line 41692=>Beregond and the Lord's servants that stood there aghast.  'And so pass also 
line 41693=>the days of Gondor that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. Ill 
line 41694=>deeds  have been done here; but let now  all enmity that lies between you be 
line 41695=>put away, for  it  was contrived by the Enemy and works  his  will. You have 
line 41696=>been  caught  in a net of warring duties that  you did not weave. But think, 
line 41697=>you servants of the Lord, blind in your obedience, that but  for the treason 
line 41698=>of Beregond Faramir, Captain of the White Tower, would now also be burned. 
line 41699=>     'Bear away  from this unhappy place your comrades who  have fallen. And 
line 41700=>we  will bear  Faramir, Steward of Gondor, to  a place where he can sleep in 
line 41701=>peace, or die if that be his doom.' 
line 41702=>     Then Gandalf and Beregond taking  up the bier bore  it away towards the 
line 41703=>Houses of  Hea ling,  while behind them walked Pippin with downcast head. 
line 41704=>But 
line 41705=>the servants of the Lord  stood gazing as stricken  men  at the house of the 
line 41706=>dead; and even  as Gandalf  came to the end of Rath Dnnen there was a  great 
line 41707=>noise. Looking back  they  saw the  dome of the house crack and smokes issue 
line 41708=>forth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; 
line 41709=>but still unabated the flames danced and  flickered among the ruins. Then in 
line 41710=>terror the servants fled and followed Gandalf.  
line 41711=>
line 41712=>####-     At length they came back  to  the Steward's Door,  and  Beregond looked  
line 41713=>with grief  at  the porter. 'This deed I  shall  ever rue,'  he said; 'but a  
line 41714=>madness of haste was on  me, and he would not listen, but drew sword against  
line 41715=>me.' Then  taking  the key that he had  wr ested from the slain man he closed 
line 41716=>the door and locked it.  'This should now be given to the Lord  Faramir,' he 
line 41717=>said. 
line 41718=>     'The Prince  of Dol Amroth is in  command in the absence of  the Lord,' 
line 41719=>said Gandalf; 'but since he is not here,  I must take this on  myself. I bid 
line 41720=>you keep the key and guard it, until the City is set in order again.' 
line 41721=>     Now  at last they passed  into the high circles of the City, and in the 
line 41722=>light of morning  they went their way towards  the  Houses  of Healing;  and 
line 41723=>these were  fair houses set apart, for the care of those who were grievously 
line 41724=>sick, but now  they were prepared  for the tending of men  hurt in battle or  
line 41725=>dying. They stood not far from  the  Citadel-gate, in the sixth circle, nigh 
line 41726=>to  its southward  wall, and about  them was a  garden and a greensward with 
line 41727=>trees,  the only such place in the City. There dwelt the few women  that had 
line 41728=>been permitted to remain in Minas Tirith, since they were skilled in healing 
line 41729=>or in the service of the healers.  
line 41730=>     But even  as Gandalf and his companions came  carrying the bier  to the 
line 41731=>main door of the  Houses, they heard a great cry that went up from the field 
line 41732=>before the Gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died 
line 41733=>away on the wind. So terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, 
line 41734=>and  yet when it  had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a  
line 41735=>hope as they had not known  since the darkness came  out of the East; and it  
line 41736=>seemed  to them that  the  light grew  clear and the sun  broke  through the 
line 41737=>clouds. 
line 41738=>     But Gandalf's  face was  grave and sad, and bidding Beregond and Pippin 
line 41739=>to take  Faramir into the Houses  of Healing, he  went  up on  to  the walls 
line 41740=>nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood  in the new sun and 
line 41741=>looked out. And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that  had 
line 41742=>befallen; and when Jomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood 
line 41743=>beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast  his cloak about 
line 41744=>him again,  and went  from  the  walls.  And Beregond  and  Pippin found him 
line 41745=>standing in thought before the door of the Houses when they came out. 
line 41746=>     They looked at him, and for  a  while he was  silent. At last he spoke. 
line 41747=>'My friends,' he  said, 'and all you people of this city and of the  Western 
line 41748=>lands! Things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass. Shall we weep or  
line 41749=>
line 41750=>####-be glad? Beyond hope the Captain  of  our foes has been  destroyed,  and you 
line 41751=>have heard the echo of his last despair. But he has not gone without woe and 
line 41752=>bitter loss. And that I might have averted but for the madness of  Denethor. 
line 41753=>So long  has the reach of our Enemy become! Alas! but now I perceive how his 
line 41754=>will was able to enter into the very heart of the City. 
line 41755=>     'Though  the  Stewards  deemed  that  it  was  a secret  kept  only   by 
line 41756=>themselves, long ago I guessed that here in the White Tower, one at least of 
line 41757=>the Seven Seeing  Stones was preserved. In  the days of his  wisdom Denethor  
line 41758=>did not presume to  use it,  nor to  challenge Sauron, knowing the limits of 
line 41759=>his own strength. But his wisdom failed; and I fear that as the peril of his 
line 41760=>realm grew he looked in the Stone and was deceived: far too often, I  guess,  
line 41761=>since Boromir departed.  He was too great to  be subdued  to the will of the 
line 41762=>Dark Power, he saw nonetheless only those things which  that Power permitted 
line 41763=>him to see. The knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service 
line 41764=>to  him; yet the vision of the great might  of Mordor that was  shown to him 
line 41765=>fed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.' 
line 41766=>     'Now I understand what seemed so strange to me!' said Pippin shuddering 
line 41767=>at his memories as he spoke. 'The Lord went away from the room where 
line 41768=>Faramir 
line 41769=>lay; and it was only when  he  returned that I first thought he was changed, 
line 41770=>old and broken.' 
line 41771=>     'It was  in the very hour  that  Faramir was brought to the Tower  that 
line 41772=>many of us saw  a strange light in the topmost chamber,' said Beregond. 'But 
line 41773=>we have  seen that light before, and it has  long been rumoured in the City, 
line 41774=>that the Lord would at times wrestle in thought with his Enemy.' 
line 41775=>     'Alas!  then I  have guessed rightly,' said Gandalf. 'Thus  the will of 
line 41776=>Sauron entered into Minas  Tirith; and thus  I  have  been delayed here. And 
line 41777=>here I shall still be forced to remain, for I shall soon have other charges,  
line 41778=>not Faramir only. 
line 41779=>     'Now I must go down to meet those  who come. I have seen  a  sight upon 
line 41780=>the field that is very grievous to my heart, and greater sorrow may yet come 
line 41781=>to  pass.  Come  with me, Pippin! But you,  Beregond,  should  return to the 
line 41782=>Citadel and tell the chief of the Guard there what has befallen. It  will be 
line 41783=>his duty, I fear, to withdraw you from the Guard; but  say to him that, if I 
line 41784=>may give him counsel, you should be sent to the Houses of Healing, to be the 
line 41785=>guard and servant of your captain, and to be at his side when he awakes  - if 
line 41786=>that shall ever be again. For by you  he  was saved from the fire. Go now! I 
line 41787=>
line 41788=>####-shall return soon.' 
line 41789=>     With  that  he  turned away and went with Pippin down towards the lower 
line 41790=>city. And even as they  hastened on their way the wind brought  a grey rain,  
line 41791=>and all the fires sank, and there arose a great smoke before them. 
line 41792=> 
line 41793=>
line 41794=>####- 
line 41795=>
line 41796=>Chapter 8. The Houses of Healing 
line 41797=>
line 41798=> 
line 41799=> 
line 41800=>     A mist was in Merry's eyes of tears  and weariness when they  drew near  
line 41801=>the  ruined  Gate of  Minas Tirith. He gave  little  heed to the  wreck  and 
line 41802=>slaughter that lay about all. Fire and smoke and  stench was in the air; for  
line 41803=>many engines  had been burned  or cast into  the fire-pits, and many  of the 
line 41804=>slain also, while here  and there lay  many  carcases of the great  Southron 
line 41805=>monsters, half-burned, or broken by stone-cast, or shot through  the eyes by 
line 41806=>the  valiant archers of Morthond. The flying rain had ceased for a time, and 
line 41807=>the sun  gleamed  up above;  but all the lower city  was still  wrapped in a  
line 41808=>smouldering reek. 
line 41809=>     Already men were labouring to clear a way through the jetsam of battle; 
line 41810=>and now out from the Gate came some bearing litters. Gently  they laid Jowyn 
line 41811=>upon soft pillows; but the king's body  they covered  with a great  cloth of 
line 41812=>gold,  and  they bore  torches about  him, and  their flames,  pale  in  the 
line 41813=>sunlight, were fluttered by the wind. 
line 41814=>     So Thjoden and Jowyn came  to  the City of Gondor, and all who saw them 
line 41815=>bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the 
line 41816=>burned circle, and went on and up  along the  streets of stone. To Merry the 
line 41817=>ascent seemed  agelong,  a  meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on 
line 41818=>and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize. 
line 41819=>     Slowly the  lights of  the torches in front of  him flickered  and went 
line 41820=>out,  and he was walking in  a darkness; and he  thought: 'This  is a tunnel 
line 41821=>leading to a tomb; there we shall stay forever.' But suddenly into his dream 
line 41822=>there fell a living voice. 
line 41823=>     'Well, Merry! Thank goodness I have found you!' 
line 41824=>     He looked up  and the mist before his eyes  cleared a little. There was 
line 41825=>Pippin! They were face  to face in a narrow lane,  and but for themselves it 
line 41826=>was empty. He rubbed his eyes.  
line 41827=>     'Where is the  king?' he said.  'And Jowyn?' Then he stumbled  and  sat 
line 41828=>down on a doorstep and began to weep again. 
line 41829=>     'They have gone up  into the Citadel,'  said  Pippin. 'I think you must  
line 41830=>have fallen  asleep on your  feet and taken the wrong turning. When we found 
line 41831=>that you were  not  with them,  Gandalf sent me to  look  for you.  Poor old 
line 41832=>Merry! How glad  I am to see you again!  But  you are worn out, and  I won't 
line 41833=>
line 41834=>####-bother you with any talk. But tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?' 
line 41835=>     'No,' said Merry. 'Well, no, I don't think so. But I can't use my right 
line 41836=>arm, Pippin, not since I stabbed  him.  And my  sword burned all away like a 
line 41837=>piece of wood.' 
line 41838=>     Pippin's face was anxious. 'Well, you had better come with me  as quick  
line 41839=>as you can,' he said. 'I wish I could carry you. You aren't fit to walk  any 
line 41840=>further. They shouldn't have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. 
line 41841=>So  many dreadful things have  happened  in the  City, Merry, that  one poor  
line 41842=>hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked.' 
line 41843=>     'It's not  always  a misfortune being overlooked,' said Merry.  'I  was 
line 41844=>overlooked just now by  - no, no, I can't speak of it.  Help me, Pippin! It's 
line 41845=>all going dark again, and my arm is so cold.' 
line 41846=>     'Lean on me, Merry lad!' said Pippin. 'Come now! Foot by foot. It's not 
line 41847=>far.' 
line 41848=>     'Are you going to bury me?' said Merry. 
line 41849=>     'No, indeed!' said Pippin, trying  to sound cheerful, though  his heart 
line 41850=>was wrung with fear and pity. 'No, we are going to the Houses of Healing.' 
line 41851=>     They turned out of the lane that ran  between tall houses and the outer  
line 41852=>wall of the fourth circle, and they  regained the main street climbing up to 
line 41853=>the Citadel. Step by step they  went, while Merry swayed and murmured as one 
line 41854=>in sleep. 
line 41855=>     'I'll never  get him there,' thought  Pippin. 'Is there  no one to help 
line 41856=>me? I can't leave him here.' Just then to his surprise a boy came running up 
line 41857=>behind, and as he passed he recognized Bergil Beregond's son. 
line 41858=>     'Hullo,  Bergil!' he  called.  'Where  are you going?  Glad to  see you  
line 41859=>again, and still alive!' 
line 41860=>     'I am running errands for the Healers,' said Bergil.  'I cannot stay.' 
line 41861=>     'Don't!'  said  Pippin.  'But  tell  them up  there that I have a  sick  
line 41862=>hobbit, a perian  mind you, come from the battle-field. I don't think he can 
line 41863=>walk so far. If Mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.' Bergil 
line 41864=>ran on. 
line 41865=>     'I'd better wait here,'  thought  Pippin. So he let Merry  sink  gently 
line 41866=>down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight,  and then he sat down beside 
line 41867=>him, laying Merry's head  in his lap. He felt his body and limbs gently, and 
line 41868=>took his friend's hands in his own. The right hand felt icy to the touch. 
line 41869=>     It was  not long  before Gandalf himself  came  in  search  of them. He 
line 41870=>stooped over Merry and caressed  his brow; then he lifted him carefully. 'He 
line 41871=>
line 41872=>####-should have  been  borne in  honour  into this  city,' he said.  'He has well 
line 41873=>repaid my trust; for  if Elrond had  not yielded to me, neither of you would 
line 41874=>have  set  out; and then far more grievous would the  evils of this day have 
line 41875=>been.' He sighed. 'And yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the 
line 41876=>time the battle hangs in the balance.' 
line 41877=>     So at last  Faramir and  Jowyn and Meriadoc  were laid  in  beds in the 
line 41878=>Houses of  Healing; and there they were tended well. For though all lore was 
line 41879=>in  these latter days fallen  from its  fullness  of old, the  leechcraft of 
line 41880=>Gondor was still wise, and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt, and all 
line 41881=>such  sickness as east of  the Sea mortal men  were subject to. Save old age 
line 41882=>only. For that  they had  found no  cure; and indeed the span of their lives 
line 41883=>had now waned to little more than that of  other men, and those  among  them 
line 41884=>who passed the tale of  five score years with vigour were grown few, save in  
line 41885=>some houses of purer blood.  But now their art and  knowledge were  baffled; 
line 41886=>for there  were  many sick of a  malady that  would not  be healed; and  they 
line 41887=>called it the Black Shadow, for it came from the Nazgyl.  And those who were 
line 41888=>stricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper  dream, and  then passed to 
line 41889=>silence and a deadly cold, and so died. And it seemed to  the tenders  of the 
line 41890=>sick that on the Halfling and  on the Lady of Rohan this malady lay heavily.  
line 41891=>Still  at whiles as  the  morning wore away  they would speak,  murmuring in 
line 41892=>their  dreams; and  the  watchers  listened  to all that  they said,  hoping 
line 41893=>perhaps  to learn something that  would help them to understand their hurts.  
line 41894=>But  soon they  began to fall down into the darkness, and as the sun  turned 
line 41895=>west a  grey shadow crept over  their faces. But Faramir burned with a fever  
line 41896=>that would not abate. 
line 41897=>     Gandalf  went  from one to the other full of care, and he was told  all 
line 41898=>that the watchers could hear. And so  the day passed, while the great battle 
line 41899=>outside went on with shifting  hopes and strange  tidings; and still Gandalf 
line 41900=>waited and watched and did not  go forth; till at last the red sunset filled 
line 41901=>all the sky, and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the  
line 41902=>sick.  Then  it seemed to those  who  stood by that  in the glow  the  faces 
line 41903=>flushed softly as with health returning, but it was only a mockery of hope. 
line 41904=>     Then an old  wife, Ioreth, the eldest  of the women who  served in that 
line 41905=>house, looking on the fair  face  of Faramir, wept, for all the people loved 
line 41906=>him. And  she said: 'Alas! if he should die. Would that there  were kings in 
line 41907=>Gondor , as there were once  upon a time,  they  say! For  it is said in  old 
line 41908=>lore: The hands of the king  are  the hands of a healer. And so the rightful 
line 41909=>
line 41910=>####-king could ever be known.' 
line 41911=>     And Gandalf,  who  stood by, said:  'Men  may long remember your words,  
line 41912=>Ioreth! For  there  is hope  in them. Maybe a king has  indeed  returned  to 
line 41913=>Gondor; or  have  you not  heard the strange tidings that  have come to  the 
line 41914=>City?' 
line 41915=>     'I  have been  too busy with this and that  to  heed all the crying and 
line 41916=>shouting,' she answered. 'All  I hope is that those murdering devils  do not 
line 41917=>come to this House and trouble the sick.' 
line 41918=>     Then Gandalf went  out in haste, and already  the fire  in  the sky was 
line 41919=>burning out, and the smouldering  hills were  fading, while ash-grey evening 
line 41920=>crept over the fields.  
line 41921=>     Now  as  the sun went down  Aragorn and Jomer and Imrahil drew near the 
line 41922=>City  with their captains and knights; and  when they came  before the  Gate 
line 41923=>Aragorn said: 
line 41924=>     'Behold the  Sun setting in  a  great fire! It is a sign of the end and 
line 41925=>fall of many things, and a change in the tides of  the world.  But this City 
line 41926=>and realm has rested in the charge of the  Stewards for many long years, and 
line 41927=>I  fear that if I enter it unbidden, then doubt and debate may  arise, which 
line 41928=>should not be while this war is  fought.  I will not enter in, nor  make any 
line 41929=>claim, until  it be seen whether we or Mordor shall prevail. Men shall pitch 
line 41930=>my tents upon  the field,  and here  I will await the welcome of the Lord of 
line 41931=>the City.' 
line 41932=>     But Jomer  said: 'Already you have raised the banner  of the Kings  and 
line 41933=>displayed  the  tokens  of  Elendil's  House.  Will you suffer  these to  be 
line 41934=>challenged?' 
line 41935=>     'No,' said Aragorn. 'But I deem the time unripe; and I have no mind for 
line 41936=>strife except with our Enemy and his servants. ' 
line 41937=>     And the Prince  Imrahil said. Your words, lord, are wise, if one who is 
line 41938=>a kinsman of  the  Lord Denethor  may counsel  you  in  this  matter. He  is 
line 41939=>strong-willed  and proud, but old; and  his mood has been strange  since his 
line 41940=>son was stricken down. Yet I would not have  you remain like a beggar at the 
line 41941=>door.' 
line 41942=>     'Not  a beggar,' said Aragorn. 'Say a captain  of the Rangers, who  are 
line 41943=>unused to  cities and  houses of  stone.' And he commanded  that  his banner  
line 41944=>should be furled;  and he did off the Star of the  North Kingdom and gave it 
line 41945=>to the keeping of the sons of Elrond. 
line 41946=>     Then the Prince Imrahil and Jomer of Rohan left him and passed  through 
line 41947=>
line 41948=>####-the City and the tumult of the people,  and mounted to the Citadel; and they 
line 41949=>came to the Hall of the Tower, seeking the Steward. But they found his chair 
line 41950=>empty, and before the dais lay Thjoden King of the Mark upon a bed of state; 
line 41951=>and twelve torches stood about it, and twelve  guards, knights both of Rohan 
line 41952=>and Gondor. And the hangings  of  the bed were of  green and white, but upon 
line 41953=>the king  was laid the great cloth  of gold up  to his breast, and upon that 
line 41954=>his  unsheathed sword, and at his  feet his shield, The light of the torches 
line 41955=>shimmered in  his  white hair like  sun in the spray of a fountain,  but his 
line 41956=>face  was fair  and young, save that  a peace lay on it beyond the reach  of 
line 41957=>youth; and it seemed that he slept. 
line 41958=>     When they had stood silent  for a time  beside  the king, Imrahil said: 
line 41959=>'Where is the Steward? And where also is Mithrandir?' 
line 41960=>     And one of the guards answered: 'The Steward of Gondor is in the Houses 
line 41961=>of Healing.' 
line 41962=>     But  Jomer said: 'Where is the  Lady Jowyn,  my sister; for surely  she 
line 41963=>should be lying beside the  king, and  in no  less  honour? Where  have they 
line 41964=>bestowed her?' 
line 41965=>     And Imrahil said: 'But the Lady Jowyn was yet living when they bore her  
line 41966=>hither. Did you not know?' 
line 41967=>     Then hope unlooked-for came so  suddenly to Jomer's  heart, and with it 
line 41968=>the bite of care and fear renewed, that he said no more, but turned and went 
line 41969=>swiftly from the hall; and the Prince followed him. And when they came forth 
line 41970=>evening had fallen and many stars were in the sky. And there came Gandalf on 
line 41971=>foot and with him one cloaked in grey; and they met before the doors of  the 
line 41972=>Houses of Healing. And they greeted Gandalf and said: 'We  seek the Steward, 
line 41973=>and men say that  he is in  this House.  Has any hurt befallen him? And  the 
line 41974=>Lady Jowyn, where is she?' 
line 41975=>     And Gandalf answered: 'She lies  within and is not  dead, but  is  near 
line 41976=>death. But the Lord Faramir was wounded by an evil dart,  as you have heard, 
line 41977=>and he  is  now the Steward; for Denethor has departed, and his house is  in 
line 41978=>ashes.' And they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told. 
line 41979=>     But Imrahil  said: 'So victory is shorn of gladness,  and  it is bitter  
line 41980=>bought, if both Gondor and Rohan are in one day bereft of their lords. Jomer  
line 41981=>rules the Rohirrim. Who shall rule the City meanwhile? Shall we not send now 
line 41982=>for the Lord Aragorn?' 
line 41983=>     And the cloaked man spoke and said:  'He is  come.' And they saw  as he 
line 41984=>stepped  into the  light of  the lantern  by the  door that  it was Aragorn, 
line 41985=>
line 41986=>####-wrapped in the grey cloak  of  Lurien above his mail, and bearing  no  other 
line 41987=>token  than the green stone of Galadriel. 'I  have come because Gandalf begs 
line 41988=>me  to do so,'  he  said. 'But for the present I am but the  Captain  of the 
line 41989=>D®nedain of Arnor;  and the Lord  of  Dol Amroth  shall rule the City  until  
line 41990=>Faramir awakes. But it is my counsel that Gandalf should rule us  all in the 
line 41991=>days  that follow and in our  dealings with the Enemy.' And they agreed upon 
line 41992=>that. 
line 41993=>     Then Gandalf  said:  'Let us not  stay  at the door,  for the  time  is 
line 41994=>urgent. Let us enter! For  it is only in the coming of Aragorn that any hope 
line 41995=>remains for the sick that lie in the House. Thus spake Ioreth, wise-woman of  
line 41996=>Gondor: The hands of the  king are  the hands of a healer, and  so shall the 
line 41997=>rightful king be known .' 
line 41998=>     Then  Aragorn entered first and the  others followed. And there  at the 
line 41999=>door were two guards in the  livery of the  Cita del: one tall, but the other  
line 42000=>scarce the height of a boy; and when he saw them he cried  aloud in surprise 
line 42001=>and joy. 
line 42002=>     'Strider! How splendid! Do you know, I guessed  it was you in the black  
line 42003=>ships. But  they were all  shouting  corsairs and wouldn't listen to me. How 
line 42004=>did you do it?' 
line 42005=>     Aragorn laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. 'Well met indeed!' he 
line 42006=>said. 'But there is not time yet for travellers' tales.' 
line 42007=>     But Imrahil said to Jomer: 'Is it  thus that we speak to our kings? Yet 
line 42008=>maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!' 
line 42009=>     And Aragorn hearing  him,  turned and  said: 'Verily, for  in the  high 
line 42010=>tongue of old I am Elessar, the Elfstone, and  Envinyatar, the Renewer': and  
line 42011=>he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. 'But Strider shall 
line 42012=>be the name of my house, if that be ever established.  In the high tongue it 
line 42013=>will not  sound  so ill,  and  Telcontar I will be and all  the heirs  of my 
line 42014=>body.' 
line 42015=>     And with that they passed into the House; and as  they went towards the 
line 42016=>rooms  where the  sick were tended  Gandalf told of the deeds  of  Jowyn and 
line 42017=>Meriadoc. 'For,' he said, 'long have I stood by them and at first they spoke 
line 42018=>much in their dreaming, before they sank into  the deadly darkness. Also  it 
line 42019=>is given to me to see many things  far off.' 
line 42020=>     Aragorn  went first to Faramir, and then to the Lady Jowyn, and last to 
line 42021=>Merry. When  he had looked on the faces of the sick  and seen their hurts he 
line 42022=>sighed. 'Here I must  put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,' 
line 42023=>
line 42024=>####-he said.  'Would that Elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, 
line 42025=>and has the greater power.' 
line 42026=>     And Jomer seeing  that he was sorrowful and weary said: 'First you must  
line 42027=>rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?' 
line 42028=>     But Aragorn answered: 'Nay, for these  three, and most soon for Faramir,  
line 42029=>time is running out. All speed is needed.' 
line 42030=>     Then he called to Ioreth and he said: 'You have store  in this House of 
line 42031=>the herbs of healing?' 
line 42032=>     'Yes, lord,' she answered; 'but not enough, I reckon, for all that will 
line 42033=>need  them. But I am sure I  do  not know  where we shall find more; for all 
line 42034=>things are amiss in these dreadful days, what with  fires and  burnings, and 
line 42035=>the lads that run errands so few, and all the roads blocked. Why, it is days 
line 42036=>out of count since ever a carrier came in from Lossarnach to the market! But 
line 42037=>we do our best in this  House with what we have, as  I am sure your lordship 
line 42038=>will know.' 
line 42039=>     'I will judge that when I see,' said Aragorn.  'One thing also is short 
line 42040=>time for speech. Have you athelas?' 
line 42041=>     'I do not know,  I am  sure, lord,' she answered, 'at least not by that 
line 42042=>name. I will go and ask of the herb-master; he knows all the old names.' 
line 42043=>     'It is also called kingsfoil,' said Aragorn; 'and maybe you  know it by 
line 42044=>that name, for so the country-folk call it in these latter days.' 'Oh that!' 
line 42045=>said Ioreth. 'Well, if your lordship had named it at first I could have told 
line 42046=>you. No, we have none of it, I am sure. Why, I have  never heard that it had 
line 42047=>any great virtue;  and indeed I  have often said to  my sisters when we came 
line 42048=>upon it growing in the woods: "kingsfoil" I said, " 'tis a strange name, and 
line 42049=>I  wonder why 'tis called so; for if I were a king, I would have plants more 
line 42050=>bright in  my garden". Still it smells sweet  when bruised,  does it not? If 
line 42051=>sweet is the right word: wholesome, maybe, is nearer.' 
line 42052=>     'Wholesome verily,' said Aragorn. 'And now,  dame, if you love the Lord 
line 42053=>Faramir, run  as quick as your  tongue and get me kingsfoil, if  there  is a  
line 42054=>leaf in the City.' 
line 42055=>     'And if  not,' said Gandalf,  'I  will  ride  to Lossarnach with  Ioreth 
line 42056=>behind me, and she  shall take me to the woods, but not  to her sisters. And 
line 42057=>Shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste.' 
line 42058=>     When Ioreth was  gone, Aragorn bade the other  women to make water hot. 
line 42059=>Then he took  Faramir's hand in  his, and laid the other hand  upon the sick  
line 42060=>man's brow. It was drenched with sweat; but Faramir did not move or make any 
line 42061=>
line 42062=>####-sign, and seemed hardly to breathe. 
line 42063=>     'He is nearly spent,' said Aragorn turning to Gandalf. 'But  this comes 
line 42064=>not from  the wound. See! that  is healing. Had he been smitten by some dart  
line 42065=>of the Nazgyl,  as you thought, he would have died that night. This hurt was 
line 42066=>given  by  some  Southron arrow,  I  would guess.  Who drew it forth? Was it 
line 42067=>kept?' 
line 42068=>     'I drew it forth,'  said  Imrahil, 'and staunched the wound. But I  did 
line 42069=>not keep the arrow, for we had much to  do. It was, as I remember, just such 
line 42070=>a  dart as the Southrons use. Yet I  believed  that it came from the Shadows 
line 42071=>above, for else his fever and sickness were not  to be understood; since the 
line 42072=>wound was not deep or vital. How then do you read the matter?' 
line 42073=>     'Weariness,  grief for his father's  mood,  a  wound,  and over all the 
line 42074=>Black Breath,' said  Aragorn.  'He is a man of  staunch will, for already he 
line 42075=>had  come close  under  the Shadow  before  ever  he  rode to battle on  the 
line 42076=>out-walls.  Slowly the dark must have crept  on  him,  even as he fought and 
line 42077=>strove to hold his outpost. Would that I could have been here sooner!' 
line 42078=>     Thereupon the herb-master enter ed.  'Your lordship asked for kingsfoil, 
line 42079=>as the rustics name it, he said; or athelas in the noble tongue, or to those 
line 42080=>who know somewhat of the Valinorean. . .' 
line 42081=>     'I  do  so,'  said Aragorn, 'and I care  not  whether you say  now asla  
line 42082=>aranion or kingsfoil, so long as you have some.' 
line 42083=>     'Your  pardon lord!' said the  man. 'I see  you  are a lore-master, not 
line 42084=>merely  a captain of  war. But alas! sir, we do not keep  this  thing in the 
line 42085=>Houses of Healing, where  only the  gravely hurt or sick  are tended. For it 
line 42086=>has no virtue that we know of, save perhaps  to sweeten a fouled air, or  to 
line 42087=>drive away  some passing  heaviness.  Unless,  of  course, you  give heed to 
line 42088=>rhymes of old days which women such as our good Ioreth still repeat  without 
line 42089=>understanding. 
line 42090=>     When the black breath blows  
line 42091=>     and death's shadow grows  
line 42092=>     and all lights pass, 
line 42093=>     come athelas! come athelas! 
line 42094=>     Life to the dying 
line 42095=>     In the king's hand lying! 
line 42096=>     It is but  a doggrel, I fear, garbled  in the  memory of old wives. Its 
line 42097=>meaning I leave to your judgement, if indeed it has any. But  old folk still 
line 42098=>use an infusion of the herb for headaches.' 
line 42099=>
line 42100=>####-     'Then in the name of the  king, go  and find some old man  of less lore 
line 42101=>and more wisdom who keeps some in his house!' cried Gandalf.  
line 42102=>     Now  Aragorn knelt beside Faramir,  and held a hand  upon his brow. And 
line 42103=>those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on. For Aragorn's 
line 42104=>face  grew grey  with weariness; and ever and anon  he  called the  name  of 
line 42105=>Faramir, but each time more fa intly to their hearing, as  if Aragorn himself 
line 42106=>was removed from them, and walked afar  in some dark vale,  calling  for one 
line 42107=>that was lost. 
line 42108=>     And at last Bergil came running in, and he bore six  leaves in a cloth. 
line 42109=>'It is kingsfoil,  Sir,' he  said; 'but not fresh, I fear. It must have been 
line 42110=>culled two weeks ago at the least. I hope it will  serve, Sir?' Then looking 
line 42111=>at Faramir he burst into tears. 
line 42112=>     But Aragorn smiled. 'It  will serve,' he said. 'The worst is  now over. 
line 42113=>Stay and be comforted!'  Then taking two leaves,  he  laid them on his hands 
line 42114=>and breathed on them,  and then  he crushed them, and straightway  a  living 
line 42115=>freshness filled the room, as if the air itself awoke and tingled, sparkling 
line 42116=>with joy. And then he cast the leaves into the bowls  of steaming water that 
line 42117=>were brought  to  him,  and  at  once all hearts  were  lightened.  For  the 
line 42118=>fragrance that came to each was like a memory of dewy mornings of 
line 42119=>unshadowed 
line 42120=>sun in some land of which the fair world in Spring is itself but  a fleeting 
line 42121=>memory.  But  Aragorn  stood  up as one refreshed, and his eyes smiled as he 
line 42122=>held a bowl before Faramir's dreaming face. 
line 42123=>     'Well now!  Who would have believed  it?'  said Ioreth to  a woman that 
line 42124=>stood beside her. 'The weed is  better than I thought. It reminds me  of the 
line 42125=>roses of Imloth Melui when I was a lass, and no king could ask for better.' 
line 42126=>     Suddenly Faramir  stirred, and he  opened  his eyes,  and he looked  on 
line 42127=>Aragorn who  bent over him; and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in 
line 42128=>his  eyes, and he spoke softly.  'My  lord, you called  me. I come. What does 
line 42129=>the king command?' 
line 42130=>     'Walk no more in the shadows, but awake!' said Aragorn. 'You are weary. 
line 42131=>Rest a while, and take food, and be ready when I return.' 
line 42132=>     'I will, lord,' said Faramir. 'For who would lie idle when the king has 
line 42133=>returned?' 
line 42134=>     'Farewell then  for a while!' said Aragorn.  'I must go  to  others who 
line 42135=>need me.' And he left the chamber with Gandalf and Imrahil; but Beregond and 
line 42136=>his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy. As he followed Gandalf 
line 42137=>
line 42138=>####-and shut the door Pippin heard Ioreth exclaim: 
line 42139=>     'King! Did you hear  that? What  did I say? The  hands  of  a healer, I 
line 42140=>said.'  And  soon the word had  gone  out  from the House  that the king was 
line 42141=>indeed  come among  them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran 
line 42142=>through the City. 
line 42143=>     But Aragorn came to Jowyn, and he said: 'Here there is a  grievous hurt 
line 42144=>and a  heavy blow. The arm that  was broken  has been tended with due skill, 
line 42145=>and it will  mend in time, if she  ha s  the  strength  to live:  It  is  the 
line 42146=>shield-arm  that is maimed; but the chief evil comes through the  sword-arm.  
line 42147=>In that there now seems no life, although it is unbroken. 
line 42148=>     'Alas! For she was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind 
line 42149=>or body. And those who  will take a weapon to such an enemy must  be sterner 
line 42150=>than  steel,  if the very shock shall  not destroy them. It was an evil doom 
line 42151=>that set her in his path. For she is a fair maiden, fairest  lady of a house 
line 42152=>of queens. And yet I know not how I should speak of her. When I first looked 
line 42153=>on her  and  perceived  her unhappiness, it seemed to me that I saw a  white 
line 42154=>flower standing straight and proud, shapely as a lily, and yet knew  that it 
line 42155=>was  hard, as if  wrought by elf-wrights out of steel. Or  was  it, maybe, a  
line 42156=>frost that had turned  its sap to ice, and  so it stood, bitter-sweet, still 
line 42157=>fair to see, but stricken, soon  to fall and die? Her malady begins far back  
line 42158=>before this day, does it not, Jomer?' 
line 42159=>     'I marvel that you should  ask me,  lord,' he answered. 'For I hold you  
line 42160=>blameless  in  this  matter, as in  all else; yet  I knew not that Jowyn, my 
line 42161=>sister, was touched by any  frost, until  she first looked on you.  Care and 
line 42162=>dread she had,  and shared with me, in the days of Wormtongue and the king's 
line 42163=>bewitchment; and she tended the king in growing fear. But that did not bring  
line 42164=>her to this pass!' 
line 42165=>     'My friend,' said Gandalf,  'you had horses, and deeds of arms, and the 
line 42166=>free fields; but she, born  in the body of a maid, had  a spirit and courage 
line 42167=>at least the match of yours.  Yet  she  was doomed to wait  upon an old man, 
line 42168=>whom she  loved as a father, and watch him falling  into a  mean dishonoured 
line 42169=>dotage; and her part seemed to her more ignoble  than that  of the  staff he 
line 42170=>leaned on. 
line 42171=>     'Think you that Wormtongue  had poison only for Thjoden's ears? Dotard! 
line 42172=>What is the  house of Eorl but a thatched barn where brigands  drink  in the 
line 42173=>reek, and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs? Have you not heard 
line 42174=>
line 42175=>####-those words before? Saruman spoke them, the teacher of Wormtongue. Though  
line 42176=>I 
line 42177=>do  not doubt that Wormtongue at home  wrapped their  meaning in terms  
line 42178=>more 
line 42179=>cunning. My lord,  if your sister's love for you, and her will still bent to 
line 42180=>her duty, had not restrained her lips; you might have heard even such things 
line 42181=>as these  escape them. But who knows what she spoke to  the darkness, alone, 
line 42182=>in the bitter watches of the night, when all her  life seemed shrinking, and 
line 42183=>the walls of her bower closing in  about her,  a hutch  to trammel some wild  
line 42184=>thing in? ' 
line 42185=>     Then Jomer was  silent, and looked on  his sister, as if pondering anew 
line 42186=>all the days of their past life together. But Aragorn said: 'I saw also what 
line 42187=>you saw,  Jomer. Few other  griefs amid the  ill  chances of this world have 
line 42188=>more  bitterness and shame for a man's heart than  to  behold the  love of a  
line 42189=>lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned Sorrow and pity have followed 
line 42190=>me ever since I left her desperate in Dunharrow and rode to the Paths of the 
line 42191=>Dead;  and no  fear upon  that way was so present as the fear for what might  
line 42192=>befall her. And yet, Jomer, I  say to you that she loves you more truly than 
line 42193=>me; for you she loves and knows; but  in me  she loves  only a shadow and  a 
line 42194=>thought: a hope of glory and  great deeds, and lands far from  the fields of 
line 42195=>Rohan. 
line 42196=>     'I have, maybe, the power to heal her body, and to recall  her from the 
line 42197=>dark valley. But to what she will awake: hope, or forgetfulness, or despair, 
line 42198=>I do  not know. And if to despair, then  she will die, unless  other healing 
line 42199=>comes  which  I cannot bring. Alas!  for  her  deeds have  set her among  the 
line 42200=>queens of great renown.' 
line 42201=>     Then Aragorn stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed white as 
line 42202=>a lily, cold as frost, and hard as graven stone.  But he bent and kissed her  
line 42203=>on the brow, and called her softly, saying: 
line 42204=>     'Jowyn Jomund's daughter, awake! For your enemy has passed away!' 
line 42205=>     She did not stir,  but now she began again  to  breathe deeply, so that 
line 42206=>her breast rose  and  fell  beneath the white linen of  the sheet. Once more 
line 42207=>Aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them into steaming water; and 
line 42208=>he laved her brow with it, and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the 
line 42209=>coverlet. 
line 42210=>     Then,  whether Aragorn had indeed some forgotten  power of Westernesse, 
line 42211=>or whether it was but his words  of the Lady Jowyn that  wrought on them, as 
line 42212=>
line 42213=>####-the sweet influence of the herb  stole about the chamber it seemed to  those 
line 42214=>who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window, and it bore no scent, 
line 42215=>but was an air wholly fresh  and  clean  and young, as if it had not  before 
line 42216=>been  breathed  by any  living thing and came  new-made from snowy 
line 42217=>mountains 
line 42218=>high beneath a  dome of stars,  or from shores of silver far away  washed by 
line 42219=>seas of foam. 
line 42220=>     'Awake, Jowyn, Lady of  Rohan!'  said  Aragor n again,  and he  took her 
line 42221=>right hand in his and  felt it  warm with life returning. 'Awake! The shadow 
line 42222=>is gone and all darkness is washed  clean!' Then he laid her hand in Jomer's 
line 42223=>and  stepped  away. 'Call  her!' he said, and  he passed  silently  from the 
line 42224=>chamber. 
line 42225=>     'Jowyn, Jowyn!' cried Jomer amid his tears. But she opened her eyes and  
line 42226=>said: 'Jomer! What  joy is this? For they said that you were slain. Nay, but 
line 42227=>that was only the dark voices in my dream. How long have I been dreaming?' 
line 42228=>     'Not long, my sister,' said Jomer. 'But think no more on it!' 
line 42229=>     ' I am  strangely weary,' she said. 'I must rest a little. But tell me, 
line 42230=>what of the Lord of the Mark? Alas! Do not tell me that that was a dream for  
line 42231=>I know that it was not. He is dead as he foresaw.' 
line 42232=>     'He is dead,' said Jomer, 'but he bade me say farewell to  Jowyn dearer  
line 42233=>than daughter. He lies now in great honour in the Citadel of Gondor.' 
line 42234=>     'That is grievous,' she said. 'And yet  it  is  good beyond all  that I 
line 42235=>dared hope in the dark  days, when it seemed that the House of Eorl was sunk 
line 42236=>in honour less than  any shepherd's cot. And what of the king's esquire, the 
line 42237=>Halfling? Jomer, you shall make him a knight  of  the Riddermark, for he  is 
line 42238=>valiant!' 
line 42239=>     'He lies nearby  in this  House,  and I will go  to him,' said Gandalf.  
line 42240=>'Jomer  shall stay here for a while. But do  not  speak  yet of  war or woe, 
line 42241=>until you are made whole  again. Great gladness  it is to see you wake again  
line 42242=>to health and hope, so valiant a lady!' 
line 42243=>     'To health?' said  Jowyn. 'It  may  be so. At  least  while there is an 
line 42244=>empty saddle of some  fallen Rider that I can  fill, and there  are deeds to 
line 42245=>do. But to hope? I do not know.' 
line 42246=>     Gandalf and Pippin came to Merry's room, and there  they found  Aragorn 
line 42247=>standing by  the  bed.   'Poor  old Merry!' cried Pippin, and  he ran to  the 
line 42248=>bedside, for it seemed to  him that  his friend looked worse, and a greyness 
line 42249=>was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow  lay on him; and suddenly 
line 42250=>
line 42251=>####-a fear seized Pippin that Merry would die. 
line 42252=>     'Do not be afraid,'  said Aragorn. 'I came in  time, and  I have called 
line 42253=>him back. He  is weary now, and grieved, and  he has taken a hurt  like  the 
line 42254=>Lady Jowyn, daring  to  smite  that deadly  thing. But  these  evils can  be 
line 42255=>amended, so strong and gay a sp irit is in him. His grief he will not forget; 
line 42256=>but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.' 
line 42257=>     Then Aragorn laid his hand on Merry's head, and passing his hand gently  
line 42258=>through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And 
line 42259=>when  the fragrance  of athelas stole through the room, like  the  scent  of 
line 42260=>orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly Merry awoke,  
line 42261=>and he said: 
line 42262=>     'I am hungry. What is the time?' 
line 42263=>     'Past supper -time  now,' said Pippin; 'though I daresay  I could  bring 
line 42264=>you something, if they will let me.' 
line 42265=>     'They will indeed,' said Gandalf. 'And anything else that this Rider of 
line 42266=>Rohan  may desire, if it can be found in Minas Tirith, where  his name is in 
line 42267=>honour.' 
line 42268=>     'Good!' said Merry.  'Then I  would  like supper first, and after that a  
line 42269=>pipe.' At that his face clouded. 'No, not a pipe.  I don't think I'll  smoke 
line 42270=>again.' 
line 42271=>     'Why not?' said Pippin. 
line 42272=>     'Well,' answered Merry slowly. 'He is dead. It  has brought it all back  
line 42273=>to me.  He said he was sorry he  had never had a chance of talking herb-lore 
line 42274=>with me. Almost the last thing he ever said. I shan't ever be able to  smoke 
line 42275=>again without  thinking of  him, and  that day, Pippin, when he  rode up  to 
line 42276=>Isengard and was so polite.' 
line 42277=>     'Smoke then, and  think of  him!' said  Aragorn.  'For he  was a gentle 
line 42278=>heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to 
line 42279=>a last fair  morning.  Though your  service to him was brief, it should be a  
line 42280=>memory glad and honourable to the end of your days.' 
line 42281=>     Merry  smiled. 'Well then,' he said, 'if  Strider will  provide what is 
line 42282=>needed, I will smoke and think. I had some of Saruman's best in my pack, but 
line 42283=>what became of it in the battle, I am sure I don't know.' 
line 42284=>     'Master  Meriadoc,'  said  Aragorn,  'if  you  think that  I have passed 
line 42285=>through the  mountains and the realm of Gondor with  fire and sword to bring 
line 42286=>herbs to a  careless soldier who throws away his gear,  you are mistaken. If 
line 42287=>your pack has not been found, then you must send for the herb-master of this 
line 42288=>
line 42289=>####-House. And he will tell you that he  did  not know that the herb  you desire 
line 42290=>had  any  virtues, but  that it is  called westmansweed by  the vulgar,  and 
line 42291=>galenas by the  noble,  and  other names  in other tongues more learned, and 
line 42292=>after adding  a few half-forgotten  rhymes that he  does not understand,  he 
line 42293=>will regretfully inform  you  that there is none in the  House, and  he will 
line 42294=>leave you  to reflect  on  the history of tongues.  And so now must I. For I 
line 42295=>have not slept in such a bed as this, since I rode from Dunharrow, nor eaten 
line 42296=>since the dark before dawn.' 
line 42297=>     Merry seized his hand and kissed it. 'I am frightfully sorry,' he said. 
line 42298=>'Go at once!  Ever since that night at Bree we have been  a nuisance to you. 
line 42299=>But it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less 
line 42300=>than they mean. We fear to say too much. It robs us of the  right words when  
line 42301=>a jest is out of place.' 
line 42302=>     'I  know that well, or I would not deal with you in the same way ' said 
line 42303=>Aragorn. 'May the Shire live for ever unwithered!' And kissing Merry he went 
line 42304=>out, and Gandalf went with him.  
line 42305=>     Pippin  remained behind. 'Was  there  ever any one like him?'  he said. 
line 42306=>'Except Gandalf, of course. I think they  must be related. My dear ass, your 
line 42307=>pack is lying by your bed, and you  had  it on your back when I  met you. He 
line 42308=>saw it all the time, of course. And anyway I have some stuff of my own. Come 
line 42309=>on now! Longbottom Leaf it is.  Fill up while I run and see about some food. 
line 42310=>And  then let's be  easy for  a bit. Dear me!  We Tooks  and Brandybucks, we 
line 42311=>can't live long on the heights.' 
line 42312=>     'No,' said Merry. 'I can't. Not yet, at any rate. But at least, Pippin, 
line 42313=>we can now see them, and honour them. It is best to  love first what you are 
line 42314=>fitted to love, I suppose: you must start somewhere and have some roots, and 
line 42315=>the soil of the Shire is deep. Still there are things deeper and higher; and 
line 42316=>not a gaffer could tend his garden  in  what he calls  peace  but  for them, 
line 42317=>whether  he knows about them or not.  I am  glad that   I know about them,  a  
line 42318=>little. But I don't know why I am talking like this. Where is that leaf? And 
line 42319=>get my pipe out of my pack, if it isn't broken.' 
line 42320=>     Aragorn and  Gandalf went now to the  Warden of the  Houses of Healing, 
line 42321=>and they counselled him that Faramir and Jowyn should remain there and still 
line 42322=>be tended with care for many days. 
line 42323=>     'The Lady Jowyn,' said Aragorn, 'will wish soon to rise and depart; but 
line 42324=>she should not be  permitted to do so,  if you  can in any way restrain her, 
line 42325=>until at least ten days be passed.' 
line 42326=>
line 42327=>####-     'As for Faramir,' said Gandalf, 'he must soon  learn that his father is 
line 42328=>dead. But the full  tale of the  madness  of Denethor should  not be told to 
line 42329=>him, until  he is quite  healed and has duties to do. See  that Beregond and 
line 42330=>the perian who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!' 
line 42331=>     And the other perian Meriadoc who is  under my care, what of him?' said 
line 42332=>the Warden. 
line 42333=>     'It  is likely that  he will  be  fit  to arise tomorrow, for  a  short 
line 42334=>while,' said Aragorn.  'Let him do so, if he  wishes. He may walk a little in 
line 42335=>the care of his friends.' 
line 42336=>     'They are a remarkable race,' said the Warden, nodding his head.  'Very 
line 42337=>tough in the fibre, I deem.' 
line 42338=>     At the  doors of the Houses many were already gathered to  see Aragorn,  
line 42339=>and they  followed  after him; and when at last he  had supped, men came and 
line 42340=>prayed that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose lives were in 
line 42341=>peril through hurt or wound, or who lay under the Black  Shadow. And 
line 42342=>Aragorn 
line 42343=>arose and went out, and he sent for  the sons of  Elrond,  and together they 
line 42344=>laboured  far into the  night. And word went through the City: 'The  King is 
line 42345=>come again indeed.' And they named  him Elfstone, because of the green stone 
line 42346=>that  he wore, and so  the name  which it was for etold at his  birth that he 
line 42347=>should bear was chosen for him by his own people. 
line 42348=>     And when he  could labour no  more,  he cast his  cloak  about him, and 
line 42349=>slipped out of the City, and went to his tent just ere dawn and  slept for a  
line 42350=>little. And in the morning the banner of  Dol Amroth, a  white ship  like  a  
line 42351=>swan upon blue water, floated from the Tower, and men looked up and 
line 42352=>wondered 
line 42353=>if the coming of the King had been but a dream. 
line 42354=> 
line 42355=>
line 42356=>####- 
line 42357=>
line 42358=>Chapter 9. The Last Debate 
line 42359=>
line 42360=> 
line 42361=> 
line 42362=>     The morning came after  the  day of battle, and it was fair with  light 
line 42363=>clouds and the wind turning  westward. Legolas and  Gimli were early abroad, 
line 42364=>and  they  begged leave to go up  into the City; for  they were eager to see 
line 42365=>Merry and Pippin. 
line 42366=>     'It is good to learn that they are still alive,' said Gimli;  'for they 
line 42367=>cost us great pains in our march over Rohan, and I would not have such pains 
line 42368=>all wasted.' 
line 42369=>     Together the  Elf and the Dwarf entered Minas Tirith, and folk that saw 
line 42370=>them  pass  marvelled to see such companions; for Legolas was fair  of  face 
line 42371=>beyond the measure of Men, and  he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he 
line 42372=>walked in the morning; but Gimli stalked  beside him, stroking his beard and 
line 42373=>staring about him. 
line 42374=>     'There is  some  good  stone-work here,'  he said as he  looked  a t the 
line 42375=>walls;  'but also  some that is  less good, and  the streets could be better  
line 42376=>contrived. When Aragorn comes into his own, I shall offer him the service of 
line 42377=>stonewrights of the Mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of.' 
line 42378=>     'They need more gardens,' said Legolas. 'The houses are dead, and there 
line 42379=>is too little  here that grows and is glad.  If Aragorn comes into his  own, 
line 42380=>the people of the Wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not 
line 42381=>die.' 
line 42382=>     At  length they came to the Prince  Imrahil, and  Legolas  looked at him 
line 42383=>and bowed  low; for he  saw that here  indeed was one who had elven-blood in 
line 42384=>his veins. 'Hail, lord!' he said.  'It is long since the people  of Nimrodel 
line 42385=>left the woodlands of Lurien, and yet still one may see that  no t all sailed 
line 42386=>from Amroth's haven west over water.' 
line 42387=>     'So it is said in the lore of my land,' said the Prince; 'yet never has 
line 42388=>one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count. And I marvel to 
line 42389=>see one here now in the midst of sorrow and war. What do you seek?' 
line 42390=>     'I  am  one of the Nine  Companions  who  set  out with Mithrandir from 
line 42391=>Imladris, said Legolas and with  this Dwarf, my friend, I came with the Lord 
line 42392=>Aragorn. But now we wish to see  our friends. Meriadoc and Peregrin, who are 
line 42393=>in your keeping, we are told.' 
line 42394=>     'You  will  find them  in  the Houses of Healing, and  I will  lead you  
line 42395=>
line 42396=>####-thither,' said Imrahil. 
line 42397=>     'It will be  enough if you send one to guide  us,  lord,' said Legolas.  
line 42398=>'For Aragorn sends this message to you. He does not wish  to  enter the City 
line 42399=>again at this  time. Yet there is need  for the captains to hold  council at 
line 42400=>once, and he prays that you and Jomer of  Rohan will come down to his tents,  
line 42401=>as soon as may be. Mithrandir is already there.' 
line 42402=>     'We will come,' said Imrahil; and they parted with courteous words. 
line 42403=>     'That  is  a  fair lord and a great captain of men,'  said Legolas. 'If 
line 42404=>Gondor has such men still in these  days of fading, great must have been its 
line 42405=>glory in the days of its rising.' 
line 42406=>     'And doubtless the good stone-work is the older and  was wrought in the 
line 42407=>first building,' said  Gimli. 'It is ever so with the things that Men begin: 
line 42408=>there  is a frost  in Spring, or a blight in Summer, and they  fail of their 
line 42409=>promise.' 
line 42410=>     'Yet seldom do they fail of their seed,' said  Legolas. 'And that  will 
line 42411=>lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked-for. 
line 42412=>The deeds of Men will outlast us, Gimli.' 
line 42413=>     'And yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens, I guess,' said 
line 42414=>the Dwarf. 
line 42415=>     'To that the Elves know not the answer,' said Legolas.  
line 42416=>     With that the servant of the  Prince came and led them to the Houses of 
line 42417=>Healing; and there they found their friends in the garden, and their meeting 
line 42418=>was a merry one.  For a while  they walked and talked, rejoicing for a brief 
line 42419=>space in peace  and rest under  the morning high up in the windy  circles of 
line 42420=>the City. Then when Merry became weary, they went and sat upon the wall 
line 42421=>with 
line 42422=>the  greensward of  the  Houses of Healing behind them; and  away  southward 
line 42423=>before  them was the Anduin glittering in the sun, as it flowed away, out of 
line 42424=>the  sight even  of Legolas, into the wide  flats and green haze of Lebennin 
line 42425=>and South Ithilien. 
line 42426=>     And now Legolas fell silent, while the others talked, and he looked out 
line 42427=>against the sun,  and as  he  gazed he  saw white sea -birds  beating  up the 
line 42428=>River. 
line 42429=>     'Look!' he cried. 'Gulls! They are flying far inland. A wonder they are 
line 42430=>to me and a trouble to my heart. Never in  all my life had I met them, until 
line 42431=>we came to  Pelargir, and  there I heard them crying in the air as we rode to 
line 42432=>the battle of the ships. Then I stood still, forgetting war in Middle-earth; 
line 42433=>
line 42434=>####-for their wailing  voices spoke to me of the Sea. The Sea!  Alas! I have not 
line 42435=>yet  beheld  it.  But  deep  in  the  hearts  of  a ll  my  kindred lies  the 
line 42436=>sea -longing,  which it is perilous  to stir. Alas! for the  gulls. No  peace 
line 42437=>shall I have again under beech or under elm.' 
line 42438=>     'Say not so!' said Gimli. 'There are  countless things still to see  in 
line 42439=>Middle-earth, and great works  to  do. But if  all  the fair folk take to the 
line 42440=>Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.' 
line 42441=>     'Dull and dreary indeed!' said Merry: 'You must  not go to the  Havens, 
line 42442=>Legolas. There will always  be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise 
line 42443=>dwarves like Gimli, who need you. At least I  hope so. Though I feel somehow 
line 42444=>that the worst of this war is still to come. How I wish it was all over, and 
line 42445=>well over!' 
line 42446=>     'Don't  be  so gloomy!' cried Pippin.  'The Sun is shining, and here we 
line 42447=>are  together  for a day or two at least. I want to hear more about you all. 
line 42448=>Come, Gimli!  You  and  Legolas have mentioned  your  strange  journey  with 
line 42449=>Strider about a dozen times  already  this  morning. But you haven't told me 
line 42450=>anything about it.' 
line 42451=>     'The Sun may  shine here,' said Gimli, 'but  there are memories of that 
line 42452=>road  that I do not wish to recall out of the darkness. Had I known what was 
line 42453=>before me, I think  that not for any friendship would I have taken the Paths 
line 42454=>of the Dead.' 
line 42455=>     'The Paths of the Dead?' said Pippin.  'I heard Aragorn say  that and I 
line 42456=>wondered what he could mean. Won't you tell us some more?' 
line 42457=>     'Not willingly,' said Gimli.  'For upon that road  I  was put to shame: 
line 42458=>Gimli Gluin's son, who had deemed  himself  more tough than Men, and 
line 42459=>hardier 
line 42460=>under  earth than  any Elf. But neither did  I prove;  and I was held to the 
line 42461=>road only by the will of Aragorn.' 
line 42462=>     'And by the love of him also,' said Legolas. 'For all those who come to 
line 42463=>know him come to love him after his own fashion,  even the cold maiden of the 
line 42464=>Rohirrim. It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we 
line 42465=>left Dunharrow, and such a fear was  on all the folk that none would look on 
line 42466=>our going,  save the Lady Jowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below. There 
line 42467=>was grief at that parting, and I was grieved to behold it.' 
line 42468=>     'Alas! I had heart only for myself,' said Gimli. 'Nay! I will not speak 
line 42469=>of that journey.' 
line 42470=>     He fell silent;  but Pippin and  Merry were  so eager for news that  at 
line 42471=>
line 42472=>####-last  Legolas  said:  'I will tell you enough for your peace;  for I felt not 
line 42473=>the  horror, and I feared not the shadows of  Men, powerless and frail  as I 
line 42474=>deemed them.' 
line 42475=>     Swiftly then he told of  the haunted  road under the mountains, and the 
line 42476=>dark tryst at Erech, and the gr eat ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to 
line 42477=>Pelargir on Anduin. 'Four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from 
line 42478=>the Black Stone,' he said.  'And lo! in the darkness of Mordor my hope rose;  
line 42479=>for in that  gloom the Shadow Host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible 
line 42480=>to look upon. Some I saw riding, some striding, yet all moving with the same 
line 42481=>great speed. Silent they were, but there was a gleam in  their eyes. In  the 
line 42482=>uplands of Lamedon they overtook our horses, and  swept round us, and  would 
line 42483=>have passed us by, if Aragorn had not forbidden them. 
line 42484=>     'At his command they fell back. "Even the shades of Men are obedient to 
line 42485=>his will," I thought. "They may serve his needs yet! " 
line 42486=>     'One day of light  we  rode, and then  came the  day  without dawn, a nd 
line 42487=>still we rode on, and  Ciril and Ringlu we crossed; and on  the third day we 
line 42488=>came to  Linhir above  the mouth  of  Gilrain.  And  there  men  of  Lamedon 
line 42489=>contested the fords with fell folk  of Umbar and Harad who had sailed up the 
line 42490=>river. But  defenders   and  foes alike gave up  the battle and fled  when we 
line 42491=>came,  crying out that the King of the Dead was upon them. Only Angbor, Lord 
line 42492=>of Lamedon, had the heart to abide us; and Aragorn bade  him gather his folk 
line 42493=>and come behind, if they dared, when the Grey Host had passed. 
line 42494=>     ' "At Pelargir the Heir of Isildur will have need of you," he said. 
line 42495=>     'Thus we crossed  over Gilrain,  driving the allies  of  Mordor in rout 
line 42496=>before us; and then we rested a while. But soon Aragorn  arose, saying: "Lo!  
line 42497=>already  Mina s Tirith is assailed. I  fear that it  will fall ere we come to 
line 42498=>its aid." So  we mounted again before  night had passed and went on with all  
line 42499=>the speed that our horses could endure over the plains of Lebennin.' 
line 42500=>     Legolas paused  and  sighed,  and turning his eyes southward softly  he 
line 42501=>sang: 
line 42502=>     Silver flow the streams from Celos to Erui 
line 42503=>     In the green fields of Lebennin! 
line 42504=>     Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea 
line 42505=>     The white lilies sway, 
line 42506=>     And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin  
line 42507=>     In the green fields of Lebennin, 
line 42508=>     In the wind from the Sea! 
line 42509=>
line 42510=>####-     'Green are those  fields in the songs of my people; but  they were dark 
line 42511=>then,  grey  wastes  in  the blackness  before  us. And over  the wide land, 
line 42512=>trampling unheeded the grass and  the flowers, we hunted our foes through  a 
line 42513=>day and a night, until we came at the bitter end to the Great River at last. 
line 42514=>     'Then I thought in my heart that we drew near to the  Sea; for wide was 
line 42515=>the  water in the darkness, and sea -birds innumerable cried on its,  shores.  
line 42516=>Alas  for  the wailing of the  gulls! Did  not the Lady tell me to beware of 
line 42517=>them? And now I cannot forget them.' 
line 42518=>     'For my part  I heeded them not,' said Gimli; 'for we came then at last  
line 42519=>upon battle in earnest. There at Pelargir lay the main fleet of Umbar, fifty 
line 42520=>great ships and smaller  vessels beyond count. Many of those that we pursued 
line 42521=>had reached the havens before us, and brought their fear with them; and some 
line 42522=>of  the ships had put off, seeking to escape down the River  or to reach  the 
line 42523=>far shore; and many of  the  smaller  craft were  ablaze.  But the Haradrim, 
line 42524=>being  now  driven  to the brink, turned at  bay,  and they were  fierce  in 
line 42525=>despair; and they laughed when they looked on us, for they were a great army 
line 42526=>still. 
line 42527=>     'But Aragorn  halted and cried with a great voice:  "Now  come!  By the 
line 42528=>Black Stone I call you! " And suddenly the Shadow Host that had hung back at 
line 42529=>the last  came up like a grey tide, sweeping all away before it. Faint cries 
line 42530=>I heard, and  dim horns b lowing, and a murmur as of countless far voices: it  
line 42531=>was like the echo of  some forgotten battle in the Dark Years long ago. Pale  
line 42532=>swords were drawn; but I know not whether their blades would still bite, for  
line 42533=>the Dead needed no longer any weapon but fear. None would withstand them. 
line 42534=>     'To every  ship they came that was drawn up, and then  they passed over  
line 42535=>the water to those that were anchored; and all the mariners were filled with 
line 42536=>a madness  of  terror and leaped  overboard, save the  slaves chained to the 
line 42537=>oars. Reckless  we rode among  our fleeing foes,  driving them  like leaves,  
line 42538=>until  we  came to  the  shore. And then to each  of  the  great  ships that 
line 42539=>remained Aragorn sent one of the D®nedain,  and  they comforted the captives 
line 42540=>that were aboard, and bade  them put aside fear and be free. 
line 42541=>     'Ere  that dark day ended none of the  enemy were left to resist us all 
line 42542=>were drowned, or were flying  south in the hope to find their own lands upon 
line 42543=>foot.  Strange and wonderful I thought it that  the designs of Mordor should 
line 42544=>be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness. With its own weapons was 
line 42545=>it worsted!' 
line 42546=>     'Strange indeed,' said Legolas. 'In that  hour I  looked on Aragorn and 
line 42547=>
line 42548=>####-thought how  great and terrible a Lord he might have become in the  strength 
line 42549=>of his  will, had he taken the Ring to  himself.  Not for naught does Mordor  
line 42550=>fear him. But nobler is his spirit than  the understanding of Sauron; for is 
line 42551=>he not of  the children of  L®thien? Never shall that  line fail, though the 
line 42552=>years may lengthen beyond count.' 
line 42553=>     'Beyond  the eyes of the Dwarves are  such  foretellings,'  said Gimli. 
line 42554=>'But mighty indeed was  Aragorn that day. Lo! all the black fleet was in his 
line 42555=>hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it. 
line 42556=>Then he  let sound a great concourse  of trumpets taken  from the enemy; and 
line 42557=>the Shadow Host withdrew to the shore. There they stood silent, hardly to be  
line 42558=>seen, save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the  ships 
line 42559=>that were  burning.  And Aragorn  spoke  in a  loud voice  to  the Dead Men, 
line 42560=>crying: 
line 42561=>     ' "Hear  now the words of the Heir of Isildur!  Your oath is fulfilled. 
line 42562=>Go back and trouble not the valleys ever again! Depart and be at rest! " 
line 42563=>     'And thereupon the King of the Dead stood out before the host and broke 
line 42564=>his spear and cast it down. Then he bowed low and  turned away; and  swiftly 
line 42565=>the whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is driven back by  
line 42566=>a sudden wind; and it seemed to me that I awoke from a dream. 
line 42567=>     'That  night  we  rested  while  others  laboured.  For there were many 
line 42568=>captives set  free,  and many slaves released who  had  been folk  of Gondor  
line 42569=>taken in raids; and  soon also  there  was  a great gathering  of men out of 
line 42570=>Lebennin and the  Ethir, and Angbor of Lamedon came u p with all the 
line 42571=>horsemen 
line 42572=>that he could muster. Now that the fear of the Dead was removed they came to 
line 42573=>aid us and to look on  the Heir of Isildur; for the  rumour of that name had 
line 42574=>run like fire in the dark. 
line 42575=>     'And  that  is near the end  of our tale.  For  during  that evening and 
line 42576=>night many ships were  made ready and  manned; and in the morning the  fleet 
line 42577=>set forth. Long  past it now seems,  yet it was but the morn of  the day ere 
line 42578=>yesterday, the  sixth  since  we rode  from Dunharrow. But still Aragorn was 
line 42579=>driven by fear that time was too short. 
line 42580=>     '  "It is forty leagues and  two from Pelargir to  the  landings at the 
line 42581=>Harlond,"  he  said.  "Yet to  the  Harlond we must  come tomorrow  or  fail  
line 42582=>utterly." 
line 42583=>     'The oars were now wielded by free men, and manfully they laboured; yet 
line 42584=>slowly we passed up  the Great River, for  we strove against its stream, and 
line 42585=>
line 42586=>####-though that is not swift down in  the South,  we had no help  of wind. Heavy 
line 42587=>would my heart have been, for all our victory at the  havens, if Legolas had 
line 42588=>not laughed suddenly. 
line 42589=>     ' "Up  with your beard, Durin's son! " he said. "For thus is it spoken: 
line 42590=>Oft hope is  born, when  all is forlorn." But what hope  he saw from afar he 
line 42591=>would  not tell. When  night came it  did  but deepen  the darkness, and our 
line 42592=>hearts were  hot, for away in  the North we saw a red glow under the  cloud,  
line 42593=>and Aragorn said: "Minas Tirith is burning." 
line 42594=>     'But at midnight hope was indeed born anew. Sea -crafty men of the Ethir  
line 42595=>gazing southward spoke  of a change coming  with a fresh  wind from the Sea. 
line 42596=>Long  ere day the masted ships  hoisted sail; and our speed grew, until dawn 
line 42597=>whitened the foam at our prows. And so it was, as  you know, that we came in 
line 42598=>the third  hour of the morning with a fair wind and the Sun unveiled, and we 
line 42599=>unfurled the great standard in battle. It was a great  day and a great hour, 
line 42600=>whatever may come after.' 
line 42601=>     'Follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,' said Legolas.  
line 42602=>'Great  deed was the riding of  the Paths  of the Dead, and great  it  shall 
line 42603=>remain, though none be left  in Gondor to sing of it in the days that are to 
line 42604=>come.' 
line 42605=>     'And  that may well befall,' said Gimli.  'For the faces of Aragorn and 
line 42606=>Gandalf are grave. Much I  wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents 
line 42607=>there below. For my part, like Merry, I wish that with our victory  the  war 
line 42608=>was now over.  Yet whatever is still to do, I hope to have a part in it, for  
line 42609=>the honour of the folk of the Lonely Mountain.' 
line 42610=>     'And I for the folk of the Great Wood,' said Legolas, 'and for the love 
line 42611=>of the Lord of the White Tree.' 
line 42612=>     Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high 
line 42613=>place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated. 
line 42614=>     When the Prince Imrahil had parted  from Legolas and Gimli, at once  he 
line 42615=>sent  for Jomer; and he went down with him  from the  City, and they came to 
line 42616=>the tents  of Aragorn that were set up on the field not  far  from the place 
line 42617=>where King Thjoden had  fallen.  And there they took  counsel together  with 
line 42618=>Gandalf and Aragorn and the sons of Elrond. 
line 42619=>     'My lords,' said Gandalf, 'listen to the words of the Steward of Gondor  
line 42620=>before he died: You may triumph on the fields of the Pelennor for a day, but 
line 42621=>against the Power that has  now arisen there is no victory. I do not bid you  
line 42622=>despair, as he did, but to ponder the truth in these words. 
line 42623=>
line 42624=>####-     'The  Stones of Seeing do  not lie, and not even  the Lord of Barad-dyr 
line 42625=>can make  them do so. He can, maybe, by his will choose what things shall be 
line 42626=>seen by weaker minds, or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see. 
line 42627=>Nonetheless it cannot be doubted that when Denethor saw great forces arrayed 
line 42628=>against him  in Mordor,  and more  still being gathered, he  saw  that which 
line 42629=>truly is. 
line 42630=>     'Hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the first  grea t assault. 
line 42631=>The next will be greater.  This war  then is without final hope, as Denethor  
line 42632=>perceived. Victory  cannot be  achieved by  arms, whether  you sit  here  to 
line 42633=>endure siege after siege, or  march  out to be overwhelmed beyond the River. 
line 42634=>You  have  only a  choice  of  evils;  and prudence  would  counsel  you  to 
line 42635=>strengthen such strong places as you have, and there await the onset; for so 
line 42636=>shall the time before your end be made a little longer.' 
line 42637=>     'Then you would have  us retreat to Minas Tirith, or Dol  Amroth, or to 
line 42638=>Dunharrow, and  there sit  like children on  sand-castles when  the tide  is 
line 42639=>flowing?' said Imrahil. 
line 42640=>     'That would  be no new  counsel,' said Gandalf. 'Have you not done this 
line 42641=>and  little more in all the  days of Denethor?  But no! I sa id this would be 
line 42642=>prudent. I do not counsel prudence. I said  victory could not be achieved by 
line 42643=>arms. I still hope for victory, but not by arms.  For into the midst  of all 
line 42644=>these policies comes the Ring of Power, the foundation of Barad-dyr, and the 
line 42645=>hope of Sauron. 
line 42646=>     'Concerning  this  thing,  my  lords, you now  all know enough for  the 
line 42647=>understanding of our plight, and of  Sauron's. If he regains it, your valour 
line 42648=>is  vain, and his victory will be swift and complete: so  complete that none 
line 42649=>can foresee the  end of it while this world lasts. If it is destroyed,  then 
line 42650=>he will fall; and his  fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising 
line 42651=>ever again. For he will lose the best part of the  strength  that was native 
line 42652=>to him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will  
line 42653=>crumble, and he will  be maimed  for ever, becoming a mere  spirit of malice 
line 42654=>that  gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow  or take shape. And 
line 42655=>so a great evil of this world will be removed. 
line 42656=>     'Other evils there are  that may come;  for  Sauron  is  himself  but a  
line 42657=>servant or emissary.  Yet it is  not our part to master all the tides of the 
line 42658=>world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are 
line 42659=>set, uprooting the  evil in the fields that we know, so  that those who live 
line 42660=>after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours 
line 42661=>
line 42662=>####-to rule. 
line 42663=>     'Now Sauron knows all this, and he knows that this precious thing which 
line 42664=>he lost has been found again; but he does not yet know where it is, or so we 
line 42665=>hope. And therefore he is now  in great doubt. For  if we  have  found  this 
line 42666=>thing, there are some among us with strength enough to wield it. That too he 
line 42667=>knows. For do I not guess rightly, Aragorn, that you have shown  yourself to 
line 42668=>him in the Stone of Orthanc?' 
line 42669=>     'I did so  ere I rode from the Hornburg,' answered  Aragorn. 'I  deemed 
line 42670=>that the time was ripe, and that the  Stone had  come to me  for just such a  
line 42671=>purpose. It was  then ten  days since the Ring-bearer went east from Rauros,  
line 42672=>and the Eye of Sauron, I thought, should be drawn out from his own land. Too 
line 42673=>seldom has he been challenged since he  returned to his  Tower. Though if  I 
line 42674=>had foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer, maybe I should not have 
line 42675=>dared to show myself. Bare time was given me to come to your aid.' 
line 42676=>     'But how is  this?' asked Jomer. 'All is  vain, you say,  if he has the 
line 42677=>Ring. Why should he think it not vain to assail us, if we have it?' 
line 42678=>     'He is not yet sure,' said Gandalf, 'and  he has not built up his power 
line 42679=>by waiting until his enemies are secure,  as we have done. Also we could not  
line 42680=>learn how to wield the  full  power all in a day. Indeed it can be used only 
line 42681=>by one master alone, not by many; and he will look for a time of strife, ere 
line 42682=>one  of the great among us makes himself master and puts down the others. In 
line 42683=>that time the Ring might aid him, if he were sudden. 
line 42684=>     'He  is  watching. He sees  much and hears much.  His Nazgyl  are still 
line 42685=>abroad. They passed over this field ere the sunrise, though few of the  weary 
line 42686=>and sleeping were aware of them. He studies the signs: the Sword that robbed 
line 42687=>him of his treasure re-made; the winds of fortune turning in our favour, and 
line 42688=>the defeat unlooked-for of his first assault the fall of his great Captain. 
line 42689=>     'His doubt will  be  growing, even  as we  speak here. His  Eye is  now 
line 42690=>straining towards us,  blind  almost to all  else that is moving. So we must 
line 42691=>keep it. Therein  lies all our hope. This, then, is my  counsel. We have not 
line 42692=>the Ring. In wisdom or  great folly it has been sent away  to be  destroyed, 
line 42693=>lest it destroy  us. Without it we  cannot by force defeat his force. But we 
line 42694=>must  at all  costs  keep his Eye  from his true  peril. We  cannot  achieve 
line 42695=>victory  by  arms, but by arms we can give the Ring-bearer his  only chance, 
line 42696=>frail though it be. 
line 42697=>     'As Aragorn has begun, so  we must go  on. We must push  Sauron  to his 
line 42698=>last throw. We must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his 
line 42699=>
line 42700=>####-land. We must march out to meet him at  once.  We  must  make ourselves  the 
line 42701=>bait, though his jaws  should close  on us. He will take that bait,  in hope 
line 42702=>and in  greed, for he will think that in  such rashness he sees the pride of 
line 42703=>the new Ringlord: and he will say: "So!  he pushes out his neck too soon and 
line 42704=>too far. Let him come on, and behold I will have him in a trap from which he 
line 42705=>cannot escape.  There  I  will  crush  him, and  what he  has taken  in  his 
line 42706=>insolence shall be mine again for ever." 
line 42707=>     'We must walk open-eyed into that  trap, with courage,  but small  hope 
line 42708=>for ourselves.  For, my  lords,  it may  well prove  that we ourselves shall 
line 42709=>perish utterly in  a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if 
line 42710=>Barad-dyr  be thrown down, we shall not live to  see a new age.  But this, I 
line 42711=>deem, is our  duty. And better so than  to perish nonetheless - as we surely 
line 42712=>shall, if we sit here  - and know as we die that no new age shall be.' 
line 42713=>     They were  silent for a while.  At  length Aragorn  spoke.  'As  I have 
line 42714=>begun, so I  will go on.  We  come  now  to the  very brink, where hope  and 
line 42715=>despair are akin. To waver is to fall.  Let none  now reject the counsels of 
line 42716=>Gandalf,  whose long labours against  Sauron come at last to their test. But 
line 42717=>for him all would long ago have been lost. Nonetheless I do not yet claim to  
line 42718=>command any man. Let others choose as they will.' 
line 42719=>     Then said Elrohir: 'From the North we came with this purpose,  and from 
line 42720=>Elrond our father we brought this very counsel. We will not turn back.' 
line 42721=>     'As for  myself,'  said Jomer, 'I have little knowledge of  these  deep 
line 42722=>matters; but I need it not. This I know, and it is enough, that as my friend 
line 42723=>Aragorn succoured  me and my people, so I will aid him when he calls. I will 
line 42724=>go.' 
line 42725=>     'As  for  me,'  said  Imrahil,  'the  Lord  Aragorn  I  hold to  be  my 
line 42726=>liege-lord, whether he  claim it or no. His wish  is to me a command. I will 
line 42727=>go also. Yet for a  while I stand in the place of the Steward of Gondor, and 
line 42728=>it is mine to think first of its people. To prudence some heed must still be 
line 42729=>given. For we must prepare against  all chances, good as well as  evil. Now,  
line 42730=>it may be that we shall triumph, and while there is any hope of this, Gondor  
line 42731=>must be protected.  I  would not have us return  with victory  to a City  in 
line 42732=>ruins and a land ravaged behind us. And yet we learn from the  Rohirrim that 
line 42733=>there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank.' 
line 42734=>     'That is true,' said Gandalf. 'I  do not  counsel you to leave the City 
line 42735=>all unmanned.  Indeed  the force that  we lead east need not be great enough 
line 42736=>for any  assault in earnest   upon Mordor, so  long as it be great enough  to 
line 42737=>
line 42738=>####-challenge battle. And it must move soon.  Therefore I ask the Captains: what 
line 42739=>force could we muster and lead out in two days' time at the latest? And they 
line 42740=>must be hardy men that go willingly, knowing their peril.' 
line 42741=>     'All are weary,  and very  many have  wounds  light  or grievous,' said 
line 42742=>Jomer,  'and  we have suffered  much loss of our horses, and that  is ill to 
line 42743=>bear. If we must ride soon, then I cannot  hope to  lead even two thousands, 
line 42744=>and yet leave as ma ny for the defence of the City.' 
line 42745=>     'We have not only to reckon with those who fought  on this field ' said 
line 42746=>Aragorn.  'New strength is on the way from the southern fiefs, now  that the 
line 42747=>coasts have been  rid. Four thousands I sent marching from Pelargir  through  
line 42748=>Lossarnach two days  ago; and  Angbor the fearless rides  before them. If we 
line 42749=>set out in two days  more,  they will draw nigh ere we depart. Moreover many 
line 42750=>were bidden to  follow me up the River  in  any craft they could gather; and 
line 42751=>with this wind they  will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already 
line 42752=>come to the Harlond. I judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse 
line 42753=>and foot, and yet  leave the City  in better defence  than it  was  when the 
line 42754=>assault began.' 
line 42755=>     'The Gate  is destroyed,' said Imrahil, 'and where now is the skill  to 
line 42756=>rebuild it and set it up anew?' 
line 42757=>     'In Erebor  in  the Kingdom of Dbin there is such skill,' said Aragorn; 
line 42758=>'and  if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send Gimli Gluin's 
line 42759=>son to ask for wrights of  the Mountain. But  men are better than gates, and 
line 42760=>no gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it.' 
line 42761=>     This then was the end of the debate  of the lords: that they should set 
line 42762=>forth on the  second  morning from that day with  seven thousands, if  these 
line 42763=>might  be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because 
line 42764=>of the  evil lands  into which they would go. Aragorn  should  find some two 
line 42765=>thousands  of those that he  had  gathered to him  in the South; but Imrahil 
line 42766=>should find  three  and  a half thousands;  and Jomer  five  hundreds  of the 
line 42767=>Rohirrim who  were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself  
line 42768=>should 
line 42769=>lead five hundreds of his  best Riders on horse; and another company of five 
line 42770=>hundred horse there  should be,  among which should ride the sons  of Elrond 
line 42771=>with  the D®nedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand foot 
line 42772=>and a thousand horse. But the main strength  of the  Rohirrim  that remained 
line 42773=>horsed and able to  fight, some three thousand under the command of Elfhelm, 
line 42774=>should waylay the West Road against  the enemy that was in  Anurien. And  at 
line 42775=>
line 42776=>####-once swift riders were sent out to gather  what news they could  northwards;  
line 42777=>and eastwards from Osgiliath and the road to Minas Morgul. 
line 42778=>     And when they  had reck oned up all their strength and taken thought for  
line 42779=>the  journeys  they should  make  and the  roads they should choose, Imrahil  
line 42780=>suddenly laughed aloud. 
line 42781=>     'Surely,' he cried, 'this is  the greatest jest  in  all the history of 
line 42782=>Gondor:  that  we should  ride with seven thousands,  scarce  as many as the 
line 42783=>vanguard of its army in  the days of its power, to assail the mountains  and 
line 42784=>the impenetrable  gate  of the  Black Land!  So  might  a  child  threaten a  
line 42785=>mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green  willow! If  the  Dark  Lord 
line 42786=>knows so  much as you say, Mithrandir,  will  he not rather smile than fear, 
line 42787=>and with his little finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him?' 
line 42788=>     'No, he  will try to  trap  the fly  and take the sting,' said Gandalf. 
line 42789=>'And there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand  mail -clad 
line 42790=>knights apiece. No, he will not smile.' 
line 42791=>     'Neither  shall  we,'  said Aragorn. 'If this be  jest, then it is  too 
line 42792=>bitter for laughter.  Nay, it is the last  move in a great jeopardy, and for 
line 42793=>one  side or  the other  it  will bring the end of the game.' Then  he  drew 
line 42794=>And®ril and  held it up glittering  in the sun. 'You shall  not  be sheathed 
line 42795=>again until the last battle is fought;' he said. 
line 42796=> 
line 42797=>
line 42798=>####- 
line 42799=>
line 42800=>Chapter 10. The Black Gate Opens 
line 42801=>
line 42802=> 
line 42803=> 
line 42804=>     Two days later the army of the West was all assembled on the  Pelennor.  
line 42805=>The host of Orcs and Easterlings had turned back out of Anurien, but harried 
line 42806=>and scattered by the Rohirrim they had  broken and fled with little fighting 
line 42807=>towards Cair  Andros;  and with  that  threat  destroyed  and  new  strength 
line 42808=>arriving out of the South the City  was as well  manned  as might be. Scouts 
line 42809=>reported  that  no  enemies remained  upon the  roads  east  as  far  as the 
line 42810=>Cross-roads of the Fallen King. All now was ready for the last throw.  
line 42811=>     Legolas and Gimli were to ride again together in the company of Aragorn 
line 42812=>and Gandalf, who went in the  van with the D®nedain  and the sons of Elrond. 
line 42813=>But Merry to his shame was not to go with them. 
line 42814=>     'You are  not fit for  such a  journey,' said  Aragorn. 'But  do not be 
line 42815=>ashamed.  If  you do no  more  in  this  war, you have already earned  great 
line 42816=>honour. Peregrin shall go and represent the Shirefolk; and do not grudge him 
line 42817=>his chance of peril, for  though  he has done as well as his fortune allowed 
line 42818=>him, he has yet to match your deed. But in truth all now are in like danger. 
line 42819=>Though it may be our part to  find bitter end before the  Gate of Mordor, if 
line 42820=>we do so,  then you will come also to a last  stand, either here or wherever  
line 42821=>the black tide overtakes you. Farewell!' 
line 42822=>     And  so  despondently Merry now  stood and watched the mustering of the 
line 42823=>army. Bergil was with him, and  he  also was downcast; for his father was to 
line 42824=>march leading a company of the  Men  of the City:  he could not  rejoin  the 
line 42825=>Guard until his case was judged. In that same company Pippin was also to go, 
line 42826=>as a soldier of Gondor. Merry could see him not far off, a small but upright 
line 42827=>figure among the tall men of Minas Tirith. 
line 42828=>     At last the  trumpets  rang and the army began to move. Troop by troop, 
line 42829=>and company by company,  they wheeled and went off  eastward. And long 
line 42830=>after 
line 42831=>they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the Causeway, Merry 
line 42832=>stood there. The  last glint of the morning sun  on  spear and helm twinkled 
line 42833=>and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling 
line 42834=>friendless  and  alone. Everyone  that  he cared for had  gone away into the 
line 42835=>gloom  that  hung over the distant eastern sky;  and little  hope at all was 
line 42836=>left in his heart that he wou ld ever see any of them again. 
line 42837=>
line 42838=>####-     As if recalled by his mood of despair,  the  pain in his arm  returned, 
line 42839=>and he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. He was roused by the 
line 42840=>touch of Bergil's hand. 
line 42841=>     'Come, Master Perian!' said the lad. 'You are still  in pain, I see.  I 
line 42842=>will help you back to the Healers. But do not fear! They will come back. The 
line 42843=>Men  of  Minas Tirith  will never be overcome. And  now they  have the  Lord 
line 42844=>Elfstone, and Beregond of the Guard too.' 
line 42845=>     Ere  noon the army  came  to  Osgiliath.  There  all  the  workers  and 
line 42846=>craftsmen  that  could  be  spared were  busy. Some were  strengthening  the 
line 42847=>ferries and boat-bridges that the  enemy had made and in part destroyed when 
line 42848=>they fled; some  gathered  stores and booty; and others  on the eastern side 
line 42849=>across the River were throwing up hasty works of defence. 
line 42850=>     The vanguard passed on through the ruins  of  Old Gondor, and  over the 
line 42851=>wide River, and  on up the long straight road that in the high days had been 
line 42852=>made to run  from the fair  Tower of the Sun to the tall  Tower of the Moon,  
line 42853=>which now was Minas Morgul in its accursed vale. Five miles beyond Osgiliath 
line 42854=>they halted, ending their first day's march. 
line 42855=>     But  the  horsemen  pressed  on  and  ere  evening  they  came  to  the 
line 42856=>Cross-roads and the great ring of trees, and all was silent. No sign of  any 
line 42857=>enemy  had they seen, no cry or  call had been heard, no shaft had sped from 
line 42858=>rock or  thicket by the  way, yet  ever as they went  forward  they felt the 
line 42859=>watchfulness  of  the land  increase. Tree and stone,  blade  and leaf  were 
line 42860=>listening. The darkness had been dispelled, and far away westward sunset was 
line 42861=>on the  Vale of  Anduin, and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the  
line 42862=>blue air; but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the Ephel D®ath. 
line 42863=>     Then Aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the 
line 42864=>ring  of trees,  and they blew a great fanfare, and the heralds cried aloud: 
line 42865=>'The Lords  of Gondor have returned  and all this  land  that is theirs they 
line 42866=>take back.'  The  hideous orc-head that  was  set upon the carven figure was 
line 42867=>cast down and  broken in pieces, and the old king's head was raised  and set 
line 42868=>in its place once more, still crowned with white and golden flowers: and men 
line 42869=>laboured  to wash and pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs  had put upon  
line 42870=>the stone. 
line 42871=>     Now in their debate  some had counselled that Minas Morgul should first  
line 42872=>be assailed, and if  they  might take  it,  it should  be utterly destroyed. 
line 42873=>'And, maybe,'  said Imrahil, 'the road that leads thence to  the pass  above 
line 42874=>will prove  an easier way of  assault upon the Dark Lord  than  his northern 
line 42875=>
line 42876=>####-gate.' 
line 42877=>     But against this Gandalf had spoken urgently, because of  the evil that 
line 42878=>dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and 
line 42879=>horror, and because also of the  news  that Faramir had brought.  For if the 
line 42880=>Ring-bearer had indeed attempted that  way,  then above  all they should not 
line 42881=>draw the Eye of Mordor thither.  So the next day when the main host came up, 
line 42882=>they set a strong guard upon the Cross-roads to make some defence, if Mordor  
line 42883=>should send a force  over the Morgul Pass, or should bring  more men up from 
line 42884=>the South. For that guard  they chose mostly archers  who knew  the ways  of 
line 42885=>Ithilien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about the meeting  of the 
line 42886=>ways. But Gandalf and Aragorn rode with the  vanguard  to  the  entrance  of 
line 42887=>Morgul Vale and looked on the evil city. 
line 42888=>     It was dark and  lifeless; for the Orcs and lesser creatures of  Mordor  
line 42889=>that  had  dwelt  there had been destroyed in  battle,  and the  Nazgyl were 
line 42890=>abroad. Yet the air of the valley was heavy  with fear and enmity. Then they 
line 42891=>broke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome fields and departed. 
line 42892=>     The  day  after, being the  third day  since they  set  out  from Minas 
line 42893=>Tirith, the army  began its  northward  march along  the  road.  It was some 
line 42894=>hundred  miles by that  way  from the  Cross-roads to the Morannon, and what 
line 42895=>might befall  them before they  came so  far  none knew They went openly but 
line 42896=>heedfully, with mounted scouts before them  on the road, and others on  foot 
line 42897=>upon either  side, especially  on  the  eastward flank;  for there lay  dark 
line 42898=>thickets, and  a tumbled  land of rocky ghylls  and crags,  behind which the 
line 42899=>long  grim slopes of the Ephel D®ath clambered up. The weather of  the world 
line 42900=>remained fair and the wind held in the west, but nothing could waft away the 
line 42901=>glooms  and the sad  mists  that clung  about  the Mountains of  Shadow; and 
line 42902=>behind them at whiles great smokes would arise and hover in the upper winds.  
line 42903=>     Ever and anon Gandalf let blow the trumpets, and the heralds would cry:  
line 42904=>"The  Lords of Gondor are come! Let  all leave this land  or yield them up!' 
line 42905=>But Imrahil said: 'Say not  The Lords of Gondor.  Say The King Elessar.  For 
line 42906=>that is true, even though he has  not yet  sat  upon the throne; and it will 
line 42907=>give the Enemy more thought, if  the  heralds use that name.' And thereafter  
line 42908=>thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the King Elessar. But none 
line 42909=>answered the challenge. 
line 42910=>     Nonetheless, though they marched in seeming  peace,  the hearts  of all 
line 42911=>the army, from the highest to the lowest, were downcast, and with every mile 
line 42912=>that they went  north foreboding  of evil grew heavier  on them. It was near 
line 42913=>
line 42914=>####-the  end of the second day of their  march  from  the Cross-roads  that they 
line 42915=>first met any offer  of battle.  For a strong force  of Orcs and Easterlings 
line 42916=>attempted to  take their leading companies in an ambush; and that was in the 
line 42917=>very place where Faramir  had waylaid the men of Harad, and the road went in 
line 42918=>a deep cutting through an out-thrust of the eastward hills. But the Captains 
line 42919=>of the West were well warned by their scouts, skilled men from Henneth 
line 42920=>Annyn 
line 42921=>led by Mablung; and so the ambush was itself trapped. For horsemen went 
line 42922=>wide 
line 42923=>about westward and  came  up on the flank of  the enemy and from behind, and 
line 42924=>they were destroyed or driven east into the hills. 
line 42925=>     But  the victory did  little to  enhearten the captains.  'It  is but a  
line 42926=>feint,' said Aragorn; 'and its chief purpose, I  deem, was  rather to draw us 
line 42927=>on by a false guess of our Enemy's weakness than to  do us much hurt,  yet.' 
line 42928=>And from that evening onward the Nazgyl came and followed every move  of 
line 42929=>the 
line 42930=>army. They still  flew  high and out  of sight of all  save Legolas, and  yet 
line 42931=>their presence could  be felt, as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the  
line 42932=>sun; and though the Ringwraiths did not  yet stoop low upon  their foes  and  
line 42933=>were silent, uttering no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off. 
line 42934=>     So time and  the hopeless  journey wore away. Upon the fourth day  from  
line 42935=>the Cross-roads and the sixth from Minas Tirith they came at last to the end 
line 42936=>of  the living lands,  and began to pass into the desolation that lay before 
line 42937=>the gates of the Pass of Cirith Gorgor; and  they could  descry the  marshes 
line 42938=>and the desert that  stretched north and west to  the Emyn Muil. So desolate 
line 42939=>were those places and so  deep  the horror that lay on them that some of the 
line 42940=>host were unmanned, and they could neither walk nor ride further north. 
line 42941=>     Aragorn looked  at them,  and there was pity  in his  eyes  rather than 
line 42942=>wrath;  for  these were young men from Rohan,  from Westfold  far  away,  or  
line 42943=>husbandmen  from  Lossarnach, and to them Mordor had been  from childhood  
line 42944=>a 
line 42945=>name  of evil,  and yet  unreal, a  legend that had no part in  their simple 
line 42946=>life; and now  they walked like men in a  hideous dream made true,  and they 
line 42947=>understood not this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass.  
line 42948=>     'Go!' said Aragorn. 'But  keep what honour you may, and do not run! And 
line 42949=>there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shamed. Take your 
line 42950=>way  south-west till you come to Cair Andros, and  if that is still  held by  
line 42951=>
line 42952=>####-enemies, as I think, then re-take it, if you can; and hold it to the last in 
line 42953=>defence of Gondor and Rohan!' 
line 42954=>     Then some being shamed by  his mercy  overcame their fear and  went on, 
line 42955=>and the others took new hope, hearing of a manful  deed within their measure 
line 42956=>that  they  could turn to, and they  departed.  And so,  since many men  had 
line 42957=>already  been left  at the Cross-roads,  it was with less than six thousands 
line 42958=>that the Captains of the West came at last  to challenge the  Black Gate and 
line 42959=>the might of Mordor. 
line 42960=>     They advanced  now slowly, expecting at every hour some answer to their 
line 42961=>challenge, and they drew together, since it was but waste of men to send out 
line 42962=>scouts or small parties from the main host. At nightfall of the fifth day of 
line 42963=>the march from Morgul Vale they made their last camp, and set fires about it  
line 42964=>of such dead wood and  heath as they  could find. They  passed the hours  of 
line 42965=>night  in  wakefulness  and they were aware  of many things  half-seen  that 
line 42966=>walked and prowled all about them, and they heard the howling of wolves. The 
line 42967=>wind had  died  and all  the air  seemed still. They  could see  little, for  
line 42968=>though it was cloudless and the waxing moon was four nights  old, there were 
line 42969=>smokes  and  fumes  that rose  out of the earth and  the white  crescent was 
line 42970=>shrouded in the mists of Mordor. 
line 42971=>     It grew cold. As morning came the wind bega n to stir again,  but now it 
line 42972=>came from  the North,  and  soon it  freshened to a  rising breeze. All  the 
line 42973=>night-walkers were gone, and the land seemed empty. North amid their 
line 42974=>noisome 
line 42975=>pits lay the first of the great heaps and hills of slag and broken  rock and 
line 42976=>blasted earth,  the vomit of the maggot-folk of Mordor;  but south  and  now 
line 42977=>near loomed the great rampart of Cirith Gorgor, and the Black Gate amidmost, 
line 42978=>and the two Towers of the Teeth tall and dark upon either side. For in their 
line 42979=>last march  the Capta ins had turned away from the old road as it  bent east,  
line 42980=>and avoided the peril of the lurking hills, and so now they were approaching 
line 42981=>the Morannon from the north-west, even as Frodo had done. 
line 42982=>     The two  vast iron doors of the Black Gate under its frowning arch were 
line 42983=>fast closed. Upon the battlement nothing could be seen. All was  silent  but 
line 42984=>watchful. They  were come to the last end of their folly, and stood  forlorn 
line 42985=>and chill in the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their 
line 42986=>army could not assault with hope, not even if it had brought thither engines 
line 42987=>of great power, and  the Enemy had no more force than would suffice  for the 
line 42988=>manning of  the gate  and wall alone. Yet  they  knew that all the hills and 
line 42989=>
line 42990=>####-rocks  about  the Morannon  were filled with hidden  foes, and  the  shadowy 
line 42991=>defile beyond was bored and tunnelled  by teeming broods of evil things. And 
line 42992=>as they stood they saw all the Nazgyl gathered together, hovering  above the 
line 42993=>Towers of the Teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were watched. But 
line 42994=>still the Enemy made no sign. 
line 42995=>     No  choice was left them but to play their part  to  its end. Therefore 
line 42996=>Aragorn now set the host in such array as could  best be contrived; and they  
line 42997=>were drawn up on two great  hills of blasted stone and earth  that orcs  had 
line 42998=>piled in years of labour. Before them towards Mordor lay like a moat a great 
line 42999=>mire  of  reeking  mud and foul-smelling  pools. When all  was  ordered, the 
line 43000=>Captains rode  forth towards the Black Gate with  a great  guard of horsemen 
line 43001=>and  the  banner and heralds  and  trumpeters.  There  was Gandalf as  chief 
line 43002=>herald,  and  Aragorn  with  the sons of Elrond,  and  Jomer  of Rohan,  and 
line 43003=>Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to  go also, so that 
line 43004=>all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness. 
line 43005=>     They came within cry of the Morannon, and unfurled the banner, and blew 
line 43006=>upon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over  
line 43007=>the battlement of Mordor. 
line 43008=>     'Come forth!'  they cried. 'Let the Lord of the Black   Land come forth!  
line 43009=>Justice shall be done upon  him. For wrongfully he  has made war upon Gondor  
line 43010=>and  wrested its lands. Therefore the King  of Gondor demands that he should 
line 43011=>atone for his evils, and depart then for ever. Come forth!' 
line 43012=>     There was  a long  silence, and from wall and gate no cry or sound  was 
line 43013=>heard in  answer. But Sauron had already laid his plans,  and he had a  mind  
line 43014=>first to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill.  So  it was that, 
line 43015=>even  as  the  Captains were about to  turn  away, the  silence  was  broken 
line 43016=>suddenly.  There came  a  long rolling  of great  drums like thunder in  the 
line 43017=>mountains,  and  then  a  braying  of horns that  shook the very  stones and 
line 43018=>stunned men's ears.  And thereupon the  middle  door  of the Black Gate  was 
line 43019=>thrown open with a great clang, and out of it there came an embassy from the 
line 43020=>Dark Tower. 
line 43021=>     At its  head there rode a  tall  and evil  shape, mounted  upon a black  
line 43022=>horse, if  horse it was;  for it was huge  and hideous,  and its face was  a  
line 43023=>frightful mask, more like a skull than a living head,  and in the sockets of 
line 43024=>its eyes and in its nostrils there burned a flame. The  rider was robed  all 
line 43025=>in  black, and black was his lofty helm;  yet this  was  no Ringwraith but a  
line 43026=>living man. The Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-dyr he was, and his name is 
line 43027=>
line 43028=>####-remembered  in no  tale; for he himself had forgotten it, and he said: 'I am 
line 43029=>the Mouth of Sauron.' But it is told that he was a renegade, who came of the 
line 43030=>race of those  that are named the Black  N®menureans;  for   they established 
line 43031=>their dwellings in Middle-earth during the years of Sauron's domination, and 
line 43032=>they worshipped him, being enamoured  of evil knowledge.  And he entered the 
line 43033=>service of the  Dark Tower when it  first rose again,  and  because  of  his 
line 43034=>cunning  he grew  ever  higher  in the Lord's favour;  and  he learned  great 
line 43035=>sorcery, and knew much of the mind of Sauron; and he was more cruel than 
line 43036=>any 
line 43037=>orc. 
line 43038=>     He it was that now rode out, and with him came only a small company  of 
line 43039=>black-harnessed soldiery, a nd a  single  banner, black but  bearing on it in 
line 43040=>red the Evil Eye. Now halting a few paces before the Captains of the West he 
line 43041=>looked them up and down and laughed. 
line 43042=>     'Is  there  anyone in this rout  with authority to treat  with me?'  he 
line 43043=>asked. 'Or indeed with wit to  understand me? Not thou at least!' he mocked, 
line 43044=>turning to Aragorn with scorn. 'It needs more to make a king than a piece of 
line 43045=>elvish glass, or a rabble  such as this. Why, any brigand  of the  hills can 
line 43046=>show as good a following!' 
line 43047=>     Aragorn said naught in answer, but he took the other's eye and held it, 
line 43048=>and for a moment they strove thus; but soon, though Aragorn did not stir nor  
line 43049=>move hand to weapon, the other  quailed and  gave back as if menaced with  a  
line 43050=>blow. 'I am a herald and ambassador, a nd may not be assailed!' he cried. 
line 43051=>     'Where such  laws hold,'  said  Gandalf, 'it is  also  the  custom  for  
line 43052=>ambassadors to use less insolence. But  no one  has threatened you. You have 
line 43053=>naught to fear  from us,  until your errand is done. But unless  your master  
line 43054=>has  come  to new  wisdom, then with all  his servants  you will be in great 
line 43055=>peril.' 
line 43056=>     'So!' said the  Messenger. 'Then thou art the spokesman, old greybeard?  
line 43057=>Have we not  heard of  thee at whiles, and  of thy wanderings, ever hatching 
line 43058=>plots a nd mischief at a safe distance? But this time thou hast stuck out thy 
line 43059=>nose too far, Master Gandalf; and thou shalt see what comes to him  who sets 
line 43060=>his foolish webs before  the feet of Sauron the Great. I have  tokens that I 
line 43061=>was bidden  to show to thee -  to thee in especial, if thou shouldst dare to 
line 43062=>come.' He signed to  one of his guards, and he came forward bearing a bundle 
line 43063=>swathed in black cloths.  
line 43064=>     The Messenger put  these  aside, and there to the wonder and  dismay of 
line 43065=>
line 43066=>####-all the Captains he held up first the short sword that Sam had carried,  and 
line 43067=>next a grey  cloak with  an elven-brooch,  and last the coat of mithril-mail 
line 43068=>that  Frodo  had  worn  wrapped  in  his tattered garments. A blackness came  
line 43069=>before their eyes,  and it seemed  to  them in a moment of  silence that the 
line 43070=>world  stood  still,  but their  hearts were dead and their last  hope gone. 
line 43071=>Pippin who stood behind Prince Imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief.  
line 43072=>     'Silence!' said Gandalf sternly, thrusting him back;  but the Messenger  
line 43073=>laughed aloud. 
line 43074=>     'So you  have yet another of these imps  with you!' he cried. 'What use 
line 43075=>you  find in them I cannot guess; but to send them as  spies into Mordor  is 
line 43076=>beyond even your  accustomed folly. Still, I thank him, for it is plain that 
line 43077=>this brat  at  least has seen these tokens  before, and it would be vain for 
line 43078=>you to deny them now.' 
line 43079=>     'I do not wish to  deny  them,' said Gandalf. 'Indeed, I know them  all 
line 43080=>and all  their history,  and despite your scorn,  foul Mouth of  Sauron, you  
line 43081=>cannot say as much. But why do you bring them here?' 
line 43082=>     'Dwarf-coat,  elf-cloak, blade of the downfallen West, and spy from the 
line 43083=>little rat-land  of the Shire-nay; do not  start! We know it well - here are 
line 43084=>the marks  of a  conspiracy. Now,  maybe  he that bore  these  things was  a  
line 43085=>creature that you would not grieve to lose, and maybe otherwise: one dear to  
line 43086=>you, perhaps? If so, take swift counsel with what little wit is left to you. 
line 43087=>For  Sauron does not love  spies, and what his fate  shall be depends now on 
line 43088=>your choice.' 
line 43089=>     No one answered him;  but he  saw their faces  grey with  fear and  the 
line 43090=>horror  in their eyes, and he laughed again, for it  seemed to him  that his 
line 43091=>sport went well. 'Good, good!' he  said. 'He was dear to you, I see. Or else 
line 43092=>his  errand was one that you did not wish to fail? It  has. And now he shall 
line 43093=>endure the slow torment of years, as long and  slow as our arts in the Great 
line 43094=>Tower can contrive, and never  be released,  unless maybe when he is changed 
line 43095=>and  broken,  so  that  he may come  to you, and you  shall see what you have  
line 43096=>done. This shall surely be-unless you accept my Lord's terms.' 
line 43097=>     'Name  the  terms,'  said Gandalf steadily,  but  those nearby  saw the 
line 43098=>anguish in  his  face,  and now he  seemed an  old and wizened man, crushed, 
line 43099=>defeated at la st. They did not doubt that he would accept. 
line 43100=>     'These are the terms,' said the  Messenger, and smiled as he eyed  them 
line 43101=>one by one. 'The rabble of  Gondor and  its deluded allies shall withdraw at 
line 43102=>once beyond the Anduin, first taking oaths never  again to assail Sauron the 
line 43103=>
line 43104=>####-Great  in arms, open or  secret. All lands east of Anduin  shall be Sauron's 
line 43105=>for  ever, solely. West of the Anduin as  far as the Misty Mountains and the 
line 43106=>Gap of Rohan  shall  be tributary to  Mordor,  and men  there  shall bear no 
line 43107=>weapons, but shall  have leave to govern  their own affairs. But  they shall 
line 43108=>help  to rebuild Isengard which they have wantonly destroyed, and that shall 
line 43109=>be Sauron's, and there his lieutenant shall dwell: not Saruman, but one more 
line 43110=>worthy of trust.' 
line 43111=>     Looking in  the Messenger's  eyes they read his thought.  He was to  be  
line 43112=>that lieutenant, and gather all that remained of the West under his sway; he 
line 43113=>would be their tyrant and they his slaves.  
line 43114=>     But Gandalf said:  'This is much  to demand for  the  delivery  of  one 
line 43115=>servant: that your Master should receive in exchange what he must else fight  
line 43116=>many a war to gain! Or has the field of Gondor destroyed his hope in war, so 
line 43117=>that  he falls to haggling? And  if indeed we rated this  prisoner  so high, 
line 43118=>what  surety have we that Sauron the Base Master of Treachery, will keep his 
line 43119=>part? Where  is this prisoner?  Let him be brought forth and yielded to  us,  
line 43120=>and then we will consider these demands.' 
line 43121=>     It  seemed then to Gandalf,  intent, watching  him as a  man engaged in 
line 43122=>fencing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the Messenger was 
line 43123=>at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again. 
line 43124=>     'Do  not bandy words in  your  insolence with  the Mouth of Sauron!' he 
line 43125=>cried. 'Surety you crave! Sauron gives none. If you sue for his clemency you  
line 43126=>must first do his bidding. These are his terms. Take them or leave them!' 
line 43127=>     'These  we will take!' said Gandalf suddenly. He cast  aside  his cloak 
line 43128=>and a white  light shone forth like a sword in that black  place. Before his 
line 43129=>upraised hand   the  foul Messenger recoiled, and  Gandalf  coming seized and 
line 43130=>took from him  the tokens: coat,  cloak, and sword. 'These we  will take  in 
line 43131=>memory of our friend,' he cried.  'But  as for your  terms, we  reject  them 
line 43132=>utterly. Get you gone, for your embassy is over and death is near to you. We 
line 43133=>did not  come here  to waste words in treating  with Sauron,  faithless  and 
line 43134=>accursed; still less with one of his slaves. Begone!' 
line 43135=>     Then the Messenger of Mordor laughed no more. His face was twisted with 
line 43136=>amazement and anger to the  likeness of some wild beast that, as it crouches 
line 43137=>on  its  prey, is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod. Rage filled him 
line 43138=>and his mouth  slavered, and shapeless  sounds of fury came  strangling from 
line 43139=>his throat. But he looked at the fell faces of the Captains and their deadly 
line 43140=>eyes, and fear overcame his wrath. He  gave a great cry, and  turned, leaped 
line 43141=>
line 43142=>####-upon his  steed, and with his company galloped madly back to  Cirith Gorgor. 
line 43143=>But  as they went his soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged; and 
line 43144=>even before they came to the gate Sauron sprang his trap. 
line 43145=>     Drums rolled and fires leaped up.  The  great doors  of the  Black Gate 
line 43146=>swung  back wide. Out  of  it streamed a great host  as  swiftly as swirling 
line 43147=>waters when a sluice is lifted. 
line 43148=>     The Captains mounted  again  and rode back, and from the host of Mordor 
line 43149=>there went up a jeering yell. Dust  rose smothering the air,  as from nearby 
line 43150=>there marched up an army of Easterlings  that  had  waited for the signal in 
line 43151=>the shadows of Ered Lithui beyond the further Tower.  Down from the hills on 
line 43152=>either side of  the  Morannon poured Orcs innumerable. The men of  the  West  
line 43153=>were  trapped, and soon. all about  the grey mounds where they stood, forces 
line 43154=>ten times and more than ten times  their  match  would ring them in a sea of 
line 43155=>enemies. Sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel. 
line 43156=>     Little  time was left to Aragorn for the ordering  of  his battle. Upon 
line 43157=>the one hill he  stood with Gandalf, and there fair and desperate was raised 
line 43158=>the  ba nner of  the  Tree and  Stars.  Upon the other hill hard by stood the 
line 43159=>banners of Rohan and Dol Amroth, White Horse and Silver Swan. And about 
line 43160=>each 
line 43161=>hill a ring was made facing all ways, bristling with spear and sword. But in 
line 43162=>the front  towards Mordor  where the  first bitter  assault would come there 
line 43163=>stood the sons of Elrond on  the left with the D®nedain  about them,  and on 
line 43164=>the right  the  Prince Imrahil with the men of Dol Amroth tall and fair, and 
line 43165=>picked men of the Tower of Guard. 
line 43166=>     The  wind blew, and the trumpets sang, and  arrows whined; but the  sun 
line 43167=>now  climbing  towards  the South was  veiled  in the reeks  of Mordor,  and 
line 43168=>through a threatening haze it  gleamed, remote, a  sullen red, as if it were 
line 43169=>the ending of the day, or the  end maybe of all the world of  light. And out 
line 43170=>of the gathering  mirk the Nazgyl came with. their  cold voices crying words 
line 43171=>of death; and then all hope was quenched. 
line 43172=>     Pippin had bowed crushed with horror when  he  heard Gandalf reject the  
line 43173=>terms and  doom Frodo  to the torment  of  the  Tower;  but  he had mastered  
line 43174=>himself, and now he  stood beside Beregond in the front  rank of Gondor with 
line 43175=>Imrahil's men. For  it seemed best to him to die  soon and  leave the bitter  
line 43176=>story of his life, since all was in ruin. 
line 43177=>     'I wish Merry  was here,' he  heard himself saying, and quick  thoughts 
line 43178=>raced  through his mind, even as he watched  the enemy  come charging to the 
line 43179=>
line 43180=>####-assault. 'Well, well, now at  any rate  I understand  poor Denethor a little 
line 43181=>better. We might die together, Merry and  I, and since die we must, why not? 
line 43182=>Well, as he is not  here, I hope he'll find an easier end. But now I must do 
line 43183=>my best.' 
line 43184=>     He drew  his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red 
line 43185=>and gold; and  the flowing characters of N®menor glinted like fire upon  the 
line 43186=>blade. 'This was made for just  such an hour,' he thought. 'If only  I could 
line 43187=>smite that foul Messenger with  it, then almost I should draw level with old 
line 43188=>Merry.  Well, I'll smite some of this beastly brood before the end. I wish I 
line 43189=>could see cool sunlight and green grass again!' 
line 43190=>     Then  even  as he thought  these things the  first assault crashed into 
line 43191=>them.  The orcs hindered by the  mires that  lay before the hills halted and 
line 43192=>poured their arrows into the defending ranks.  But through them  there  came 
line 43193=>striding  up,  roaring  like beasts, a  great company of  hill-trolls out of 
line 43194=>Gorgoroth. Taller and broader than Men they were, and they were clad only in 
line 43195=>close-fitting mesh of  horny  scales, or maybe  that was their hideous hide; 
line 43196=>but they bore round  bucklers  huge and black and wielded heavy  hammers  in 
line 43197=>their  knotted hands.  Reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across,  
line 43198=>bellowing as they came. Like a  storm they broke upon the line of the men of 
line 43199=>Gondor, and beat upon helm and head, and arm and shield as smiths hewing the 
line 43200=>hot bending iron. At Pippin's  side Beregond was stunned  and overborne, and 
line 43201=>he fell;  and the great  troll-chief that  smote  him  down  bent over  him, 
line 43202=>reaching out  a  clutching  claw; for  these  fell creatures would bite  the 
line 43203=>throats of those that they threw down. 
line 43204=>     Then  Pippin  stabbed  upwards, and  the  written blade of  Westernesse 
line 43205=>pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his 
line 43206=>black blood came gushing out. He toppled forward and came crashing down 
line 43207=>like 
line 43208=>a falling rock, burying those beneath him. Blackness and stench and crushing 
line 43209=>pain came upon Pippin, and his mind fell away into a great darkness. 
line 43210=>     'So  it ends  as I  guessed  it  would,' his  thought said,  even as it 
line 43211=>fluttered away; and  it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost  gay 
line 43212=>it seemed to  be  casting off at last all doubt and care and  fear. And then 
line 43213=>even as  it  winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed 
line 43214=>to be crying in some forgotten world far above: 
line 43215=>     'The Eagles are coming! The Eagles are coming!' 
line 43216=>     For one moment more Pippin's thought hovered.  'Bilbo!'  it  said. 'But 
line 43217=>
line 43218=>####-no! That came in his tale, long long  ago. This is my  tale, and it is ended 
line 43219=>now. Good-bye!' And his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more. 
line 43220=> 
line 43221=> 
line 43222=>
line 43223=>####-

line 43228=> * BOOK VI *  
line 43229=>
line 43230=>Chapter 1. The Tower of Cirith Ungol 
line 43231=>
line 43232=> 
line 43233=> 
line 43234=>     Sam roused himself painfully from the ground. For a  moment he wondered 
line 43235=>where he was, and then all the misery and despair returned to him. He was in 
line 43236=>the deep dark outside the  under -gate of the orcs'  stronghold;  its  brazen 
line 43237=>doors were shut. He must have fallen  stunned when he hurled himself against  
line 43238=>them; but  how  long he had lain there he did not know. Then he  had been on 
line 43239=>fire, desperate and furious;  now he was shivering and cold. He crept to the 
line 43240=>doors and pressed his ears against them. 
line 43241=>     Far  within  he  could hear  faintly the voices of ores clamouring, but 
line 43242=>soon they stopped or  passed out of hearing,  and  all was still.  His  head 
line 43243=>ached and his eyes saw phantom lights in  the  darkness, but he struggled to 
line 43244=>steady  himself and  think. It  was clear at any rate that he had no hope of 
line 43245=>getting into the orc-hold by that gate; he might wait  there for days before 
line 43246=>it was opened, and he could  not wait: time  was  desperately precious. He no 
line 43247=>longer had any doubt about his duty: he must rescue  his master or perish in 
line 43248=>the attempt. 
line 43249=>     'The  perishing is more  likely, and will be a lot  easier  anyway,' he 
line 43250=>said grimly to  himself,  as  he sheathed Sting and turned  from  the brazen 
line 43251=>doors. Slowly  he  groped his  way back in  the dark along  the  tunnel, not 
line 43252=>daring to  use the elven -light; and as  he went he tried to fit together the 
line 43253=>events since Frodo and he  had left  the  Cross-roads. He  wondered what the 
line 43254=>time  was. Somewhere between one day and the next, he supposed;  but even of 
line 43255=>the days he had  quite lost count. He  was in a  land  of darkness where the 
line 43256=>days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten 
line 43257=>too. 
line 43258=>     'I wonder if they  think of us at all,' he said, 'and what is happening 
line 43259=>to them all away there.' He  waved his  hand vaguely  in the air before him; 
line 43260=>but  he  was  in fact now facing southwards,  as  he  came back to  Shelob's 
line 43261=>tunnel, not  west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the 
line 43262=>fourteenth day of  March in the  Shire-reckoning. And  even now  Aragorn was 
line 43263=>leading  the  black  fleet  from  Pelargir,  and  Merry was riding with  the 
line 43264=>
line 43265=>####-Rohirrim down the Stonewain Valley, while in Minas Tirith flames were rising 
line 43266=>and Pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of Denethor. Yet amid all 
line 43267=>their cares and  fear  the thoughts of  their friends  turned  constantly to 
line 43268=>Frodo and Sam. They were not forgotten. But they were far beyond aid, and no 
line 43269=>thought could yet  bring any help to Samwise  Hamfast's son; he was  utterly 
line 43270=>alone. 
line 43271=> 
line 43272=>     He came back at last to the  stone door of the  orc-passage, and  still 
line 43273=>unable to  discover the catch  or bolt that held it,  he scrambled  over  as 
line 43274=>before and dropped softly to  the ground. Then he made his way stealthily to 
line 43275=>the  outlet of Shelob's tunnel, where the rags  of  her great web were still 
line 43276=>blowing and swaying in the  cold airs. For cold they seemed to Sam after the  
line 43277=>noisome darkness behind;  but the  breath of  them  revived  him.  He  crept 
line 43278=>cautiously out. 
line 43279=>     All was ominously quiet.  The light was no more than that of dusk  at a  
line 43280=>dark day's end. The vast vapours that  arose in  Mordor and  went  streaming 
line 43281=>westward passed  low overhead,  a  great  welter of cloud and smoke now  lit 
line 43282=>again beneath with a sullen glow of red. 
line 43283=>     Sam  looked up  towards the orc-tower, and  suddenly  from  its  narrow 
line 43284=>windows lights stared out like small red eyes. He wondered if they were some 
line 43285=>signal.  His fear  of  the orcs,  forgot ten  for  a  while  in his wrath and 
line 43286=>desperation,  now returned. As  far  as he  could  see, there  was only  one 
line 43287=>possible course  for him to take: he  must go on  and try to find  the  main 
line 43288=>entrance to  the dreadful tower; but his knees  felt weak, and he  found that 
line 43289=>he was trembling. Drawing his eyes  down from the tower and the horns of the 
line 43290=>Cleft  before  him, he forced  his unwilling  feet  to obey him, and slowly, 
line 43291=>listening  with all  his  ears, peering into the dense shadows of  the rocks 
line 43292=>beside the way, he  retraced his steps, past the place where Frodo fell, and 
line 43293=>still the  stench of Shelob lingered,  and  then  on  and up, until he stood 
line 43294=>again in the very  cleft where  he had  put  on the Ring  and seen Shagrat's 
line 43295=>company go by. 
line 43296=>     There he halted and sat down. For the moment he could drive himself  no 
line 43297=>further. He  felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took  
line 43298=>one  step  veritably  down  into the land  of  Mordor, that  step  would  be 
line 43299=>irrevocable. He could never come back. Without a ny clear purpose he drew out 
line 43300=>the  Ring  and put it  on again. Immediately he felt the great burden of its 
line 43301=>weight, and  felt afresh,  but  now more  strong  and urgent than ever,  the 
line 43302=>
line 43303=>####-malice of the Eye of Mordor, searching, trying to pierce the shadows that it 
line 43304=>had made for its own defence, but which now  hindered it in its  unquiet and 
line 43305=>doubt. 
line 43306=>     As before, Sam found  that his  hearing was sharpened, but  that to his 
line 43307=>sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky walls of the 
line 43308=>path were pale , as if seen through  a mist, but still at a distance he heard 
line 43309=>the bubbling of Shelob in her misery: and harsh and clear, and very close it 
line 43310=>seemed, he  heard cries  and the clash of metal. He sprang to his  feet, and 
line 43311=>pressed himself against the wall beside  the road. He was glad of the  Ring, 
line 43312=>for here was  yet another company of orcs on  the  march. Or so  at first he 
line 43313=>thought.  Then suddenly  he realized that  it  was not so,  his  hearing had 
line 43314=>deceived him: the orc-cries came from the tower, whose topmost  horn was 
line 43315=>now 
line 43316=>right above him, on the left hand of the Cleft. 
line 43317=>     Sam shuddered and tried  to force  himself to  move.  There was plainly 
line 43318=>some devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all  orders  the  cruelty of  the 
line 43319=>orcs  had mastered them, and  they were tormenting Frodo,  or  even savagely 
line 43320=>hacking  him  to pieces. He listened; and as he did  a gleam of hope came to  
line 43321=>him. There could  not  be much  doubt: there was fighting in  the tower, the 
line 43322=>orcs  must be at war among themselves, Shagrat and Gorbag had come to 
line 43323=>blows. 
line 43324=>Faint as was the  hope that his  guess brought him, it  was enough to  rouse 
line 43325=>him.  There might be just a  chance. His love for Frodo rose above all other  
line 43326=>thoughts, and forgetting his peril he cried aloud: 'I'm coming, Mr. Frodo!' 
line 43327=>     He ran  forward to  the  climbing path, and  over it.  At once the road 
line 43328=>turned left and plunged steeply down. Sam had crossed into Mordor. 
line 43329=> 
line 43330=>     He took off  the  Ring, moved  it may be  by some  deep premonition  of 
line 43331=>danger,  though  to  himself he  thought  only that  he wished  to see  more 
line 43332=>clearly. `Better have a look at the worst,' he muttered. `No good blundering 
line 43333=>about in a fog!' 
line 43334=>     Hard and cruel and bitter  was the land  that met his gaze.  Before his 
line 43335=>feet the highest ridge  of the Ephel D®ath fell steeply in great cliffs down 
line 43336=>into a  dark trough, on the further side  of which there rose another ridge, 
line 43337=>much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out 
line 43338=>black  against the red light  behind them: it was the grim Morgai, the inner  
line 43339=>ring of the fences  of  the land. Far  beyond it, but almost straight ahead, 
line 43340=>
line 43341=>####-across a wide  lake  of darkness dotted  with  tiny fires, there was a great 
line 43342=>burning glow; and from it rose  in huge columns a swirling smoke,  dusty red 
line 43343=>at the  roots, black above  where it merged into the  billowing canopy  that 
line 43344=>roofed in all the accursed land. 
line 43345=>     Sam was looking  at Orodruin,  the Mountain of  Fire. Ever and anon the  
line 43346=>furnaces far  below  its ashen  cone would grow hot and with a great surging 
line 43347=>and  throbbing pour  forth rivers of  molten rock from chasms  in its sides.  
line 43348=>Some would  flow blazing towards  Barad-dyr down  great channels; some 
line 43349=>would 
line 43350=>wind their way into the  stony plain, until they cooled and lay like twisted 
line 43351=>dragon-shapes vomited from  the tormented earth .  In such an hour of  labour 
line 43352=>Sam beheld  Mount Doom, and the light  of it, cut off by the high  screen of 
line 43353=>the Ephel D®ath from those who climbed up the path from the West, now 
line 43354=>glared 
line 43355=>against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched with blood. 
line 43356=>     In that dreadful light Sam stood aghast, for now, looking to his  left, 
line 43357=>he could see the Tower of Cirith Ungol in all its strength. The horn that he 
line 43358=>had  seen from the other side was only its topmost turret. Its  eastern face 
line 43359=>stood up  in three great tiers from a shelf in the mountain-wall far  below; 
line 43360=>its back was to a  great  cliff behind, from which it  jutted out in pointed 
line 43361=>bastions, one above the other, diminishing as they rose, with sheer sides of 
line 43362=>cunning  masonry  that looked north-east  and   south-east. About the  lowest  
line 43363=>tier, two hundred feet below where Sam now  stood, there was a  battlemented 
line 43364=>wall  enclosing a narrow court.  Its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, 
line 43365=>opened  on a broad road,  the outer parapet of which ran upon the brink of a  
line 43366=>precipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness 
line 43367=>to  join the road that came  over the Morgul Pass. Then on it went through a  
line 43368=>jagged  rift in the  Morgai  out  into the  valley of Gorgoroth  and away to 
line 43369=>Barad-dyr.  The  narrow upper way on which  Sam stood leapt  swiftly down 
line 43370=>by 
line 43371=>stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to  
line 43372=>the Tower -gate. 
line 43373=>     As he gazed at it  suddenly Sam understood, almost  with a shock,  that 
line 43374=>this stronghold had been  built  not to  keep enemies out of  Mordor, but to 
line 43375=>keep them in. It was indeed one  of the works of Gondor long ago, an eastern 
line 43376=>outpost of the defences of Ithilien, made when, after the Last Alliance, Men  
line 43377=>of  Westernesse kept  watch on  the evil land of  Sauron where his creatures 
line 43378=>
line 43379=>####-still lurked. But as with Narchost and Carchost, the Towers of the Teeth, so 
line 43380=>here too the vigilance had failed, and treachery had yielded up the Tower to  
line 43381=>the Lord of the Ringwraiths, and now for long years it had been held by evil  
line 43382=>things. Since his return to Mordor, Sauron had found  it useful; for he  had 
line 43383=>few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief  purpose as of old 
line 43384=>was to prevent escape from Mordor. Though if an enemy were so rash as to try 
line 43385=>to  enter that  land  secretly, then it  was also  a  last  unsleeping guard 
line 43386=>against any that might pass the vigilance of Morgul and of Shelob. 
line 43387=>     Only too clearly Sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down 
line 43388=>under those many-eyed  walls and pass the watchful gate. And  even  if he did 
line 43389=>so, he  could not go  far  on  the guarded road beyond:  not even  the black  
line 43390=>shadows,  lying  deep where  the red glow could not reach, would shield  him 
line 43391=>long from the night-eyed orcs. But desperate as that road might be, his task  
line 43392=>was now  far worse: not to avoid the gate and escape, but to enter it, alone. 
line 43393=> 
line 43394=>     His  thought turned to the Ring, but there was  no  comfort there, only 
line 43395=>dread and danger. No  sooner had he come in sight of Mount Doom, burning 
line 43396=>far 
line 43397=>away, than he was aware of a cha nge in his burden. As it drew near the great 
line 43398=>furnaces  where,  in the deeps of time, it had been shaped  and forged,  the 
line 43399=>Ring's power grew, and  it became more fell, untameable  save by some mighty 
line 43400=>will. As Sam stood there, even though the Ring was not on  him but hanging by 
line 43401=>its chain about his neck, he felt himself enlarged, as if he were robed in a  
line 43402=>huge distorted shadow of  himself, a vast and ominous threat halted upon the 
line 43403=>walls of  Mordor. He  felt  that he had  from now on  only two  choices:  to 
line 43404=>forbear the Ring, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and challenge 
line 43405=>the Power that sat in  its dark hold beyond the valley  of  shadows. Already 
line 43406=>the Ring tempted him, gnawing at his will and  reason.  Wild fantasies arose 
line 43407=>in his mind; and he saw Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age, striding with a 
line 43408=>flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking  to  his call as 
line 43409=>he  marched to the  overthrow of  Barad-dyr. And then all the  clouds rolled 
line 43410=>away,  and the white sun  shone, and  at his command the  vale of  Gorgoroth 
line 43411=>became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to 
line 43412=>put on the Ring and claim it for his own, and all this could be. 
line 43413=>     In that hour of trial it was the love of his master that helped most to 
line 43414=>hold  him firm; but also deep  down in him lived still unconquered his plain 
line 43415=>hobbit-sense: he  knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough 
line 43416=>
line 43417=>####-to bear such a burden, even  if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray 
line 43418=>him. The one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a  
line 43419=>garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to  use, not the hands of others to 
line 43420=>command. 
line 43421=>     'And  anyway all these notions  are only a trick,' he said  to himself. 
line 43422=>'He'd spot me and cow me, before I could so much as shou t out. He'd spot me, 
line 43423=>pretty  quick, if I put the Ring  on now, in Mordor. Well, all I can say is:  
line 43424=>things look  as hopeless  as  a frost in spring.  Just when being  invisible 
line 43425=>would be really useful, I can't use the Ring! And if ever I get any further, 
line 43426=>it's going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step. So what's to be 
line 43427=>done?' 
line 43428=>     He was not  really  in any doubt. He knew  that he must go  down to the 
line 43429=>gate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders,  as if to shake 
line 43430=>off the shadow and dismiss  the phantoms, he began  slowly  to descend. With 
line 43431=>each  step he seemed to  diminish. He had not gone far  before he had shrunk 
line 43432=>again to a  very small and  frightened hobbit. He was now  passing under the  
line 43433=>very walls of the Tower, and the cries and sounds of fighting could be heard 
line 43434=>with his unaided ears. At the moment the  noise seemed to be coming from the 
line 43435=>court behind the outer wall. 
line 43436=> 
line 43437=>     Sam was about half way down the path when out of the dark gateway  into 
line 43438=>the red  glow there  came two orcs running . They  did not turn towards  him. 
line 43439=>They were  making for the main road; but  even as they ran they stumbled and 
line 43440=>fell  to the ground  and lay still.  Sam had seen no  arrows, but he guessed 
line 43441=>that the orcs had  been shot down by others on  the battlements or hidden in 
line 43442=>the shadow of the gate. He  went on, hugging  the wall on his left. One look  
line 43443=>upward had  shown him that there was no hope of  climbing it. The stone-work 
line 43444=>rose  thirty  feet, without  a crack  or ledge, to  overhanging courses like 
line 43445=>inverted steps. The gate was the only way. 
line 43446=>     He crept on;  and  as he went  he wondered how many  orcs lived  in the 
line 43447=>Tower with Shagrat, and how many Gorbag had, and what they  were 
line 43448=>quarrelling 
line 43449=>about, if  that was  what was  happening. Shagrat's company had seemed to be 
line 43450=>about forty, and  Gorbag's more than twice as large; but of course Shagrat's 
line 43451=>patrol  had  only been a part of his  garrison. Almost  certainly  they were 
line 43452=>quarrelling  about  Frodo,  and the  spoil.  For  a second  Sam  halted, for 
line 43453=>suddenly things seemed clear to him, almost as if he had seen them with  his 
line 43454=>
line 43455=>####-eyes. The mithril coat! Of course, Frodo was wearing it, and they would find 
line 43456=>it. And from what Sam had heard Gorbag would covet it. But the orders of the 
line 43457=>Dark  Tower  were at present Frodo's  only  protection, and if they were set 
line 43458=>aside, Frodo might be killed out of hand at any moment. 
line 43459=>     'Come on, you miserable sluggard!' Sam cried to  himself. `Now for it!' 
line 43460=>He drew Sting and ran towards the  open gate. But  just as he was  about  to 
line 43461=>pass under its great arch he felt a  shock: as if  he had run into some  web 
line 43462=>like Shelob's, only invisible. He could see no obstacle,  but  something too 
line 43463=>strong for his will to  overcome barred  the way. He  looked about, and then  
line 43464=>within the shadow of the gate he saw the Two Watchers. 
line 43465=>     They were like great figures seated upon thrones. Each had three joined 
line 43466=>bodies,  and three heads facing outward, and inward, and across the gateway. 
line 43467=>The  heads had vulture-faces, and on  their  great knees were  laid clawlike 
line 43468=>hands. They seemed to be carved out of huge blocks  of stone, immovable, and 
line 43469=>yet they were aware: some dreadful  spirit of evil vigilance  abode in them. 
line 43470=>They knew  an  enemy.  Visible or  invisible none  could pass unheeded. They 
line 43471=>would forbid his entry, or his escape. 
line 43472=>     Hardening his  will  Sam thrust forward once again, and  halted  with a  
line 43473=>jerk, staggering  as if from a blow  upon his  breast and head. Then greatly 
line 43474=>daring, because he could  think  of nothing  else to do, answering  a sudden 
line 43475=>thought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of Galadriel and held 
line 43476=>it up.  Its white light quickened swiftly, and  the shadows under  the  dark 
line 43477=>arch fled. The monstrous Watchers sat there cold and still, revealed  in all 
line 43478=>their hideous shape. For a moment  Sam caught a  glitter in  the black stones  
line 43479=>of their  eyes, the very malice of which made  him quail; but slowly he felt 
line 43480=>their will waver and crumble into fear. 
line 43481=>     He sprang past them; but even as he  did so, thrusting the  phial  back  
line 43482=>into his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to 
line 43483=>behind  him,  that their vigilance was  renewed. And  from  those evil heads 
line 43484=>there came  a high shrill cry that echoed  in the towering walls before him. 
line 43485=>Far up above,  like  an answering signal,  a  harsh bell  clanged  a  single 
line 43486=>stroke. 
line 43487=> 
line 43488=>     'That's done it!'  said Sam. `Now I've rung  the front-door bell! Well, 
line 43489=>come   on  somebody!'  he  cried.  `Tell  Captain  Shagrat  that  the  great 
line 43490=>Elf-warrior has called, with his elf-sword too!' 
line 43491=>     There  was no answer. Sam  strode forward. Sting glittered  blue in his 
line 43492=>
line 43493=>####-hand. The courtyard lay in  deep shadow, but he could see that  the pavement 
line 43494=>was strewn with bodies. Right at his feet were  two  orc-archers with knives 
line 43495=>sticking  in their backs. Beyond lay many  more shapes;  some singly as they 
line 43496=>had been hewn  down or shot;  others in pairs, still  grappling one another, 
line 43497=>dead  in  the very  throes  of stabbing, throttling, biting. The stones were 
line 43498=>slippery with dark blood. 
line 43499=>     Two liveries Sam noticed, one  marked  by the  Red  Eye, the other by a  
line 43500=>Moon disfigured with a ghastly  face of death;  but he did not  stop to look  
line 43501=>more closely.  Across the court a  great door at the foot of the Tower stood 
line 43502=>half  open,  and a red light came through; a large  orc  lay dead  upon  the 
line 43503=>threshold. Sam sprang over the body and went in; and then he peered about at 
line 43504=>a loss. 
line 43505=>     A  wide  and  echoing  passage led  back  from  the  door  towards  the 
line 43506=>mountain-side. It  was  dimly  lit with torches flaring  in  brackets on the 
line 43507=>walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors  and openings could 
line 43508=>be seen on this  side and  that; but it was empty save for two or three more 
line 43509=>bodies sprawling on the  floor. From what he had heard of the captains' talk  
line 43510=>Sam knew that, dead  or alive, Frodo would most likely be found in a chamber  
line 43511=>high up  in the turret far above; but he  might search for  a day  before he 
line 43512=>found the way. 
line 43513=>     'It'll  be near  the back, I  guess,' Sam  muttered.  `The  whole Tower  
line 43514=>climbs backwards-like. And anyway I'd better follow these lights.' 
line 43515=>     He advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant. 
line 43516=>Terror  was beginning to grip him again. There was no sound save the  rap of 
line 43517=>his feet, which seemed to  grow to  an echoing noise,  like  the slapping of 
line 43518=>great hands upon  the stones. The dead bodies: the emptiness; the dank black 
line 43519=>walls  that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood; the  fear of sudden 
line 43520=>death lurking in doorway or  shadow;  and behind all  his mind  the  waiting  
line 43521=>watchful malice at the gate: it  was almost more than he could  screw himself 
line 43522=>to  face. He would have welcomed a fight-with not too many enemies at a time 
line 43523=>- rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to  think  
line 43524=>of Frodo,  lying bound or  in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place.  
line 43525=>He went on. 
line 43526=>     He had passed  beyond  the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at 
line 43527=>the end  of  the passage, the inner side of  the under gate, as  he  rightly 
line 43528=>guessed,  when  there  came  from high above a dreadful  choking shriek.  He 
line 43529=>stopped short. Then he heard feet coming. Someone was running in great haste 
line 43530=>
line 43531=>####-down an echoing stairway overhead. 
line 43532=>     His  will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the 
line 43533=>chain and  clutched  the Ring. But Sam did  not put  it  on; for even as  he 
line 43534=>clasped it to his breast, an orc came clattering down. Leaping out of a dark 
line 43535=>opening at the right, it ran towards him. It was no more than six paces from 
line 43536=>him  when,  lifting its head, it  saw him;  and  Sam  could hear its gasping 
line 43537=>breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For  
line 43538=>what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit trying to hold a steady sword:  
line 43539=>it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in  a grey shadow, looming against  the 
line 43540=>wavering light behind; in one hand it held a sword, the very  light of which 
line 43541=>was a bitter pain, the other was clutched  at its breast, but held concealed 
line 43542=>some nameless menace of power and doom. 
line 43543=>     For a moment the orc crouched, and then with a hideous yelp  of fear it 
line 43544=>turned and fled back as it had come. Never  was  any dog more heartened when 
line 43545=>its  enemy turned  tail  than Sam at this unexpected flight. With a shout he 
line 43546=>gave chase. 
line 43547=>     `Yes! The Elf-warrior is loose!'  he  cried. 'I'm coming. Just you show 
line 43548=>me the way up, or I'll skin you! ' 
line 43549=>     But  the orc  was  in its own haunts,  nimble  and  well -fed. Sam was a  
line 43550=>stranger, hungry and weary.  The stairs  were  high  and  steep and winding.  
line 43551=>Sam's breath began to come in gasps. The orc had soon passed  out  of sight,  
line 43552=>and now only faintly   could be  heard the slapping of its feet as it went on 
line 43553=>and  up. Every now  and again it gave  a yell, and  the  echo  ran along the 
line 43554=>walls. But slowly all sound of it died away. 
line 43555=>     Sam plodded on.  He felt that he was on the right road, and his spirits 
line 43556=>had risen a  good  deal.  He thrust  the Ring away  and tightened his  belt. 
line 43557=>`Well, well!'  he said. `If only  they all take such a  dislike to me and my 
line 43558=>Sting, this  may  turn out  better than  I hoped. And anyway it looks  as if 
line 43559=>Shagrat, Gorbag, and company  have done nearly all my job for me. Except for  
line 43560=>that little frightened rat, I do believe  there's  nobody left alive  in the 
line 43561=>place!' 
line 43562=>     And with  that  he stopped, brought up  hard, as if he had hit his head 
line 43563=>against the stone wall. The full meaning of what he had said struck him like 
line 43564=>a  blow. Nobody  left alive!  Whose had  been that  horrible  dying  shriek? 
line 43565=>`Frodo, Frodo! Master!' he cried half sobbing. 'If they've killed you,  what 
line 43566=>shall I do? Well, I'm coming at last, right to the top, to see what I must.' 
line 43567=> 
line 43568=>
line 43569=>####-     Up, up he went. It was dark save  for an occasional torch  flaring at a  
line 43570=>turn, or beside some opening  that  led into the higher levels of the Tower. 
line 43571=>Sam tried to count the  steps, but  after two hundred he lost his reckoning. 
line 43572=>He  was moving quietly  now: for  he thought that he could hear the sound of 
line 43573=>voices talking, still  some way above. More than  one rat remained alive, it 
line 43574=>seemed. 
line 43575=>     All  at  once, when he felt that he could pump out no more  breath, nor  
line 43576=>force  his knees to bend again, the stair ended. He stood still. The  voices 
line 43577=>were  now loud and near. Sam  peered about. He had climbed right to the flat 
line 43578=>roof of the third and highest tier of the Tower: an open space, about twenty 
line 43579=>yards across, with  a low parapet. There the  stair was covered by  a  small 
line 43580=>domed chamber in the midst of the roof, with low doors facing east and west. 
line 43581=>Eastward Sam  could  see the plain  of Mordor vast  and  dark below, and the 
line 43582=>burning mountain  far away. A  fresh turmoil was surging in its  deep wells,  
line 43583=>and the rivers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of many 
line 43584=>miles the light  of them  lit the tower -top with a red glare.  Westward  the 
line 43585=>view was blocked  by the base of the great turret that stood at the  back of 
line 43586=>this upper court and reared its  horn high above the crest of the encircling 
line 43587=>hills. Light gleamed in a window-slit. Its door was not ten yards from where 
line 43588=>Sam stood. It  was open but dark, and from just within its shadow the voices 
line 43589=>came. 
line 43590=>     At first Sam did not listen; he took a pace  out  of the  eastward door  
line 43591=>and  looked  about.  At  once he saw  that up  here the  fighting  had  been 
line 43592=>fiercest. All the  court was  choked with  dead orcs  or their  severed  and 
line 43593=>scattered heads  and limbs. The place stank of death. A snarl  followed by  a 
line 43594=>blow  and  a  cry  sent him darting back into hiding. An  orc-voice rose  in 
line 43595=>anger,  and he knew  it again  at once, harsh, brutal, cold. It was  Shagrat 
line 43596=>speaking, Captain of the Tower. 
line 43597=>     `You won't  go again,  you say? Curse you, Snaga, you little maggot! If 
line 43598=>you think  I'm so damaged  that it's safe  to flout me, you're mistaken Come 
line 43599=>here, and I'll  squeeze  your  eyes out, like I did to Radbug just now.  And 
line 43600=>when some new lads come, I'll deal with you: I'll send you to Shelob.' 
line 43601=>     `They  won't  come,  not before  you're dead  anyway,'  answered  Snaga  
line 43602=>surlily. 'I've told you twice that Gorbag's swine got to the gate first, and 
line 43603=>none of ours  got out. Lagduf and Muzgash ran through, but they were shot. I 
line 43604=>saw it from a window, I tell you. And they wer e the last.' 
line 43605=>     'Then you  must go. I must stay here anyway. But  I'm  hurt.  The Black  
line 43606=>
line 43607=>####-Pits take  that filthy  rebel  Gorbag!' Shagrat's  voice trailed off into  a  
line 43608=>string of foul  names and curses. `I  gave  him  better  than  I got, but he 
line 43609=>knifed me, the dung,  before I throttled him. You must go, or  I'll eat you. 
line 43610=>News must  get through to Lugb®rz, or we'll both be for the Black Pits. Yes, 
line 43611=>you too. You won't escape by skulking here.' 
line 43612=>     `I'm not going down those stairs again,' growled Snaga, `be you captain 
line 43613=>or no. Nar! Keep your hands off your knife,  or I'll  put  an arrow  in your 
line 43614=>guts. You won't be a captain  long when They hear about all these goings-on. 
line 43615=>I've  fought for the  Tower against those  stinking Morgul-rats,  but a nice 
line 43616=>mess you two precious captains have made of things, fighting over the swag.' 
line 43617=>     'That's enough  from you,'  snarled  Shagrat. `I had my orders. It  was 
line 43618=>Gorbag started it, trying to pinch that pretty shirt.' 
line 43619=>     `Well, you put  his back up, being so high and mighty. And he had  more 
line 43620=>sense than you anyway. He told you more than once that the most dangerous of 
line 43621=>these spies was still loose, and you wouldn't  listen. And you  won't listen 
line 43622=>now. Gorbag  was right, I tell you. There's  a great fighter  about,  one of 
line 43623=>those bloody-handed  Elves, or one of the filthy tarks.1 He's coming here, I 
line 43624=>tell you. You heard the bell.  He's got past the Watchers, and that's tark's 
line 43625=>work.  He's on the stairs. And until he's off them, I'm not going  down. Not 
line 43626=>if you were a Nazgyl, I wouldn't.' 
line 43627=>     `So  that's it, is it?' yelled Shagrat. 'You'll do this, and you'll not 
line 43628=>do  that? And  when he does come, you'll bolt  and leave me? No, you  won't! 
line 43629=>I'll put red maggot-holes in your belly first.' 
line 43630=>     Out of the turret-door the  smaller  orc came flying.  Behind  him came 
line 43631=>Shagrat, a large orc with long  arms that,  as  he ran crouching, reached to 
line 43632=>the  ground. But one  arm hung  limp and seemed to be  bleeding;  the  other  
line 43633=>hugged  a  large black bundle.  In the red  glare  Sam, cowering behind  the 
line 43634=>stair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed: it was scored as 
line 43635=>if  by  rending  claws and  smeared  with blood;  slaver  dripped  from  its 
line 43636=>protruding fangs; the mouth snarled like an animal. 
line 43637=>     As far as Sam could see, Shagrat  hunted  Snaga round  the roof,  until 
line 43638=>ducking and eluding  him the  smaller  orc with a yelp darted back  into the 
line 43639=>turret  and  disappeared. Then  Shagrat halted. Out of the eastward door Sam 
line 43640=>could see  him now  by the parapet, panting,  his  left claw  clenching  and 
line 43641=>unclenching feebly. He put  the bundle on the floor and with  his right claw 
line 43642=>drew out a long red knife and spat on it.  Going to  the  parapet he  leaned 
line 43643=>over, looking down into  the outer court far below.  Twice he shouted but no 
line 43644=>
line 43645=>####-answer came. 
line 43646=>     Suddenly,  as Shagrat was stooped over the battlement, his back to  the 
line 43647=>roof-top, Sam to  his amazement  saw  that one  of the  sprawling bodies was 
line 43648=>moving. It  was  crawling. It  put out  a  claw and clutched the  bundle. It 
line 43649=>staggered up. In its  other hand it  held a broad-headed spear  with a short 
line 43650=>broken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust. But at that  very moment a  
line 43651=>hiss  escaped  its teeth, a gasp of  pain or hate. Quick as a snake  Shagrat 
line 43652=>slipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy 's throat. 
line 43653=>     `Got you, Gorbag!' he cried. 'Not quite dead, eh? Well, I'll finish  my 
line 43654=>job now.' He sprang on to the  fallen  body, and stamped and trampled it  in 
line 43655=>his  fury, stooping  now and  again to  stab and  slash  it with his  knife. 
line 43656=>Satisfied  at last, he threw back  his head and let out a  horrible gurgling 
line 43657=>yell of triumph. Then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and 
line 43658=>catching up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs.  
line 43659=>     Sam had no time  to think. He might have slipped out of the other door, 
line 43660=>but  hardly without  being seen;  and he could not have played hide-and-seek 
line 43661=>with this  hideous  orc for long. He did what was probably the best thing he 
line 43662=>could have  done.  He sprang  out to  meet  Shagrat with a shout. He was  no 
line 43663=>longer holding the Ring, but it was there, a hidden power, a  cowing  menace 
line 43664=>to the slaves of Mordor; and in his hand was Sting, and its  light smote the 
line 43665=>eyes  of  the   orc  like  the  glitter  of  cruel  stars  in  the  terrible 
line 43666=>elf-countries,  the  dream  of which was a  cold fear to all  his  kind.  And 
line 43667=>Shagrat could not  both fight and  keep hold  of his treasure.  He  stopped, 
line 43668=>growling, baring his fangs. Then once more, orc-fashion, he leapt aside, and 
line 43669=>as Sam  sprang at  him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he 
line 43670=>thrust it  hard into his  enemy's face. Sam staggered, and before  he  could 
line 43671=>recover, Shagrat darted past and down the stairs.  
line 43672=>     Sam ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far.  Soon the thought of 
line 43673=>Frodo returned  to him, and he remembered that the other  orc  had gone back 
line 43674=>into the turret. Here was another  dreadful  choice, and he  had  no time to 
line 43675=>ponder it. If Shagrat got away, he would soon get help and come back. But if 
line 43676=>Sam  pursued him,  the  other orc might  do some horrible deed up there. And 
line 43677=>anyway Sam might miss Shagrat or be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran 
line 43678=>back up the  stairs. `Wrong again, I expect,' he sighed. `But it's my job to 
line 43679=>go right up to the top first, whatever happens afterwards.' 
line 43680=>     Away below Shagrat went leaping  down the stairs and out over the court 
line 43681=>and  through the gate,  bearing his precious burden. If Sam could have  seen 
line 43682=>
line 43683=>####-him and known the grief that  his escape would bring, he might have quailed. 
line 43684=>But now his mind was set on the last stage of his search. He came cautiously  
line 43685=>to the turret-door and stepped inside. It opened into darkness. But soon his 
line 43686=>staring  eyes were aware of a dim light at  his right hand. It came  from an 
line 43687=>opening that led  to another stairway,  dark  and narrow: it appeared  to go 
line 43688=>winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. A  torch was 
line 43689=>glimmering from somewhere up above. 
line 43690=>     Softly Sam began to climb. He came  to the guttering torch, fixed above 
line 43691=>a door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: one of the 
line 43692=>red eyes that he and Frodo  had  seen from down below by the tunnel's mouth. 
line 43693=>Quickly Sam passed the door and hurried on to the second storey, dreading at 
line 43694=>any  moment to he  attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize  his throat 
line 43695=>from behind. He came  next to a window looking east and another torch  above 
line 43696=>the door to a passage through the middle  of the turret. The door  was open, 
line 43697=>the passage  dark  save for the glimmer of  the torch and the red glare from 
line 43698=>outside filtering through  the window-slit.  But here  the stair stopped and 
line 43699=>climbed  no further. Sam crept into the passage.  On either side there was a  
line 43700=>low door; both were closed and locked. There was no sound at all. 
line 43701=>     `A dead end,'  muttered Sam; `and after all my climb! This can't be the  
line 43702=>top of the tower. But what can I do now?' 
line 43703=>     He ran back to the lower  storey and tried the door. It would not move. 
line 43704=>He ran up again, and sweat began to trickle down his face. He felt that even 
line 43705=>minutes were precious, but one by one they escaped; and he could do nothing. 
line 43706=>He  cared  no  longer for Shagrat or Snaga  or any  other orc that  was ever 
line 43707=>spawned. He longed  only for his master,  for one  sight of his face  or one 
line 43708=>touch of his hand. 
line 43709=>     At last, weary and feeling finally defeated, he sat on a step below the 
line 43710=>level of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands. It  was quiet, 
line 43711=>horribly quiet.  The torch,  that was already burning  low  when he arrived, 
line 43712=>sputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide.  And 
line 43713=>then softly, to his own  surprise, there at the vain end of his long journey 
line 43714=>and his  grief, moved by what thought in his  heart he could  not  tell, Sam 
line 43715=>began to sing. 
line 43716=>     His voice sounded thin and  quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice 
line 43717=>of a forlorn and  weary hobbit  that no listening orc could possibly mistake 
line 43718=>for the  clear song of an Elven-lord. He murmured  old childish tunes out of 
line 43719=>the Shire, and snatches of Mr.  Bilbo's  rhymes that came into his mind like 
line 43720=>
line 43721=>####-fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. And then suddenly new strength 
line 43722=>rose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to 
line 43723=>fit the simple tune. 
line 43724=>     In western lands beneath the Sun  
line 43725=>     the flowers may rise in Spring, 
line 43726=>     the trees may bud, the wa ters run, 
line 43727=>     the merry finches sing. 
line 43728=>     Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night 
line 43729=>     and swaying beeches bear 
line 43730=>     the Elven-stars as jewels white  
line 43731=>     amid their branching hair. 
line 43732=> 
line 43733=>     Though here at journey's end I lie  
line 43734=>     in darkness buried deep, 
line 43735=>     beyond all towers strong and high, 
line 43736=>     beyond all mountains steep, 
line 43737=>     above all shadows rides the Sun 
line 43738=>     and Stars for ever dwell: 
line 43739=>     I will not say the Day is done, 
line 43740=>     nor bid the Stars farewell. 
line 43741=>     `Beyond  all towers strong  and high,'  he began  again,  and  then  he 
line 43742=>stopped short. He thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him. But 
line 43743=>now he could  hear nothing. Yes, he  could hear something,  but not a voice.  
line 43744=>Footsteps were  approaching.  Now  a  door was being opened  quietly in  the 
line 43745=>passage above; the hinges  creaked. Sam crouched  down  listening.  The door  
line 43746=>closed with a dull thud; and then a snarling orc-voice rang out. 
line 43747=>     'Ho la! You up  there, you dunghill rat! Stop your  squeaking,  or I'll 
line 43748=>come and deal with you. D'you hear?' 
line 43749=>     There was no answer. 
line 43750=>     'All right,' growled Snaga.  `But I'll come and  have a look at you all 
line 43751=>the same, and see what you're up to.' 
line 43752=>     The hinges creaked again, and Sam, now  peering over  the corner of the 
line 43753=>passage-threshold, saw a flicker  of light in an open doorway, and  the  dim 
line 43754=>shape of an orc  coming out. He seemed to be carrying a ladder. Suddenly the 
line 43755=>answer dawned on Sam: the topmost chamber was reached  by a trap-door in 
line 43756=>the 
line 43757=>roof of the passage. Snaga thrust the ladder  upwards, steadied it, and then 
line 43758=>
line 43759=>####-clambered  out  of  sight. Sam heard  a bolt drawn back.  Then he  heard the 
line 43760=>hideous voice speaking again. 
line 43761=>     `You  lie quiet, or  you'll pay for it! You've not got long to live  in 
line 43762=>peace, I guess; but if you don't want the fun to begin right now, keep  your 
line 43763=>trap shut, see? There's a reminder  for you!'  There was  a sound  like  the 
line 43764=>crack of a whip. 
line 43765=>     At that rage blazed in Sam's heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up, ran, 
line 43766=>and went up  the ladder  like a cat. His head came out in the middle of  the 
line 43767=>floor of a large  round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof; the westward 
line 43768=>window-slit was high and dark. Something  was lying on the floor by the wall 
line 43769=>under the window,  but over it a black  orc-shape was straddled. It raised a  
line 43770=>whip a second time, but the blow never fell. 
line 43771=>     With a cry Sam  leapt across  the floor, Sting in hand. The orc wheeled 
line 43772=>round, but before it could make a move Sam slashed  its  whip-hand  from its 
line 43773=>arm.  Howling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down  at 
line 43774=>him.  Sam's  next  blow  went wide,  and  thrown  off  his balance  he  fell 
line 43775=>backwards, clutching at  the  orc as it  stumbled over him.  Before he could 
line 43776=>scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The orc in its wild haste had tripped 
line 43777=>on the ladder -head  and  fallen through the open trap-door. Sam gave no more 
line 43778=>thought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was Frodo. 
line 43779=> 
line 43780=>     He was  naked, lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his arm 
line 43781=>was  flung up,  shielding his head,  and  across his side there ran an  ugly 
line 43782=>whip-weal. 
line 43783=>     `Frodo! Mr. Frodo,  my dear!'  cried Sam,  tears  almost  blinding him. 
line 43784=>`It's Sam, I've come!' He  half  lifted  his  master and hugged  him to  his 
line 43785=>breast. Frodo opened his eyes. 
line 43786=>     `Am  I  still  dreaming?'  he  muttered.  `But  the other  dreams  were 
line 43787=>horrible.' 
line 43788=>     `You're not dreaming at all, Master,'  said  Sam. `It's real. It's  me. 
line 43789=>I've come.' 
line 43790=>     `I can hardly believe it,' said Frodo, clutching him. `There was an orc 
line 43791=>with a whip, and then  it  turns into Sam! Then I wasn't  dreaming after all 
line 43792=>when I heard that singing down below, and I tried to answer? Was it you?' 
line 43793=>     'It was indeed, Mr.  Frodo. I'd given up  hope, almost. I couldn't find 
line 43794=>you. 
line 43795=>     Well, you have now, Sam, dear Sam, said Frodo, and he la back  in Sam's 
line 43796=>
line 43797=>####-gentle arms,  closing his eyes, like  a child at rest  when night-fears  are 
line 43798=>driven away by some loved voice or hand. 
line 43799=>     Sam  felt that he  could sit like that in endless happiness; but it was 
line 43800=>not allowed. It was not  enough for him to find his master, he  had still to 
line 43801=>try and save him. He kissed Frodo's forehead. `Come!  Wake up Mr. Frodo!' he 
line 43802=>said, trying to sound as cheerful  as he had when  he drew back the curtains 
line 43803=>at Bag End on a summer's morning. 
line 43804=>     Frodo sighed and sat up. `Where are we? How did I get here?' he asked. 
line 43805=>     'There's no time for tales till we get somewhere else, Mr. Frodo,' said 
line 43806=>Sam. `But you're in the top of that tower you and me saw from away  down  by 
line 43807=>the tunnel before the orcs got you. How long ago that wa s I don't know. More 
line 43808=>than a day, I guess.' 
line 43809=>     `Only that?' said  Frodo. `It seems weeks. You  must  tell me all about 
line 43810=>it,  if  we get  a  chance. Something  hit me, didn't  it?  And I fell  into 
line 43811=>darkness and foul dreams,  and  woke and found that  waking was worse.  Orcs 
line 43812=>were all round me. I think they had just been  pouring some horrible burning  
line 43813=>drink  down my throat. My head grew clear, but I was  aching and weary. They 
line 43814=>stripped me of everything; and then two great brutes came and questioned me, 
line 43815=>questioned  me until I thought I should go mad, standing  over me, gloating,  
line 43816=>fingering their knives. I'll never forget their claws and eyes.' 
line 43817=>     `You won't,  if you talk about them, Mr.  Frodo,' said Sam.  'And if we 
line 43818=>don't want to see them  again, the sooner we   get going  the better. Can you  
line 43819=>walk?' 
line 43820=>     `Yes,  I can walk,' said Frodo, getting up slowly. 'I am not hurt  Sam. 
line 43821=>Only  I feel very tired, and I've a pain here.' He put  his hand to the back  
line 43822=>of his neck above his left shoulder. He stood up, and it looked to Sam as if 
line 43823=>he was clothed in flame: his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp 
line 43824=>above. Twice he paced across the floor. 
line 43825=>     `That's better!' he said,  his spirits rising a  little. `I didn't dare 
line 43826=>to move when I was left alone, or  one of the guards came. Until the yelling 
line 43827=>and fighting began. The two big  brutes:  they quarrelled, I think. Over  me 
line 43828=>and my  things. I lay  here  terrified. And then all  went deadly quiet, and 
line 43829=>that was worse.' 
line 43830=>     `Yes, they  quarrelled, seemingly,'  said Sam. (There must  have been a  
line 43831=>couple  of  hundred of the dirty creatures  in  this place.  A bit of a tall 
line 43832=>order for Sam Gamgee, as  you might say. But they've done all the killing of 
line 43833=>themselves. That's lucky, but it's too long to make a song about, till we're 
line 43834=>
line 43835=>####-out of  here. Now what's to be done? You can't go walking  in the Black Land 
line 43836=>in naught but your skin, Mr. Frodo.' 
line 43837=>     `They've  taken everything, Sam,' said Frodo. `Everything I had. Do you  
line 43838=>understand?  Everything!'  He cowered on the floor again with bowed head, as 
line 43839=>his own words brought home to  him the fullness of the disaster, and despair  
line 43840=>overwhelmed him.  'The quest  has failed Sam. Even if we get out of here, we 
line 43841=>can't escape. Only  Elves  can escape. Away,  away out  of Middle-earth, far  
line 43842=>away over the Sea. If even that is wide enough to keep the Shadow out.' 
line 43843=>     `No,  not everything, Mr. Frodo. And it  hasn't failed, not yet. I took  
line 43844=>it, Mr. Frodo, begging your pardon.  And I've kept  it safe.  It's round  my 
line 43845=>neck  now, and a terrible  burden it is, too.'  Sam fumbled for the Ring and 
line 43846=>its chain. `But I suppose you must take it back.' Now it had come to it, Sam 
line 43847=>felt reluctant to give up the Ring and burden his master with it again. 
line 43848=>     `You've  got it?' gasped  Frodo. `You've  got  it  here? Sam, you're  a  
line 43849=>marvel!'  Then quickly and strangely his tone changed. `Give it to  me!'  he 
line 43850=>cried, standing up, holding out  a trembling hand. `Give it  me at once! You  
line 43851=>can't have it!' 
line 43852=>     'All right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rather startled. 'Here it is!' Slowly 
line 43853=>he drew the Ring out and passed the chain over his head.  `But you're in the 
line 43854=>land of Mordor now, sir; and when you get out, you'll see the Fiery Mountain 
line 43855=>and all. You'll find the Ring very dangerous now, and very hard to bear.  If 
line 43856=>it's too hard a job, I could share it with you, maybe?' 
line 43857=>     `No, no!'  cried Frodo, snatching the  Ring and chain from Sam's hands.  
line 43858=>`No you won't,  you thief!'  He panted, staring at Sam  with eyes wide  with 
line 43859=>fear and enmity. Then  suddenly, clasping the Ring in one clenched  fist, he 
line 43860=>stood aghast. A mist seemed  to  clear from his eyes, and  he passed a  hand 
line 43861=>over  his  aching brow. The hideous vision had  seemed so real to  him, half 
line 43862=>bemused as he was still with wound and fear. Sam had changed before his very 
line 43863=>eyes  into an orc again, leering and pawing  at his  treasure, a foul little 
line 43864=>creature with  greedy  eyes  and  slobbering  mouth. But  now the vision had 
line 43865=>passed.  There was Sam kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain,  as if 
line 43866=>he had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes. 
line 43867=>     'O Sam!' cried Frodo. `What have I said? What have I done? Forgive  me! 
line 43868=>After all you have done. It is the horrible power of the Ring. I wish it had 
line 43869=>never, never, been found. But don't mind me, Sam. I must carry the burden to 
line 43870=>the end. It can't be altered. You can't come between me and this doom.' 
line 43871=>     'That's all right, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, rubbing  his sleeve across his 
line 43872=>
line 43873=>####-eyes. `I understand. But I can still help, can't I? I've got to get  you out 
line 43874=>of  here. At  once, see! But first you want  some clothes  and gear and then 
line 43875=>some food.  The clothes will be the  easiest part. As we're in Mordor, we'd, 
line 43876=>best  dress up Mordor -fashion;  and anyway there isn't no choice. It'll have 
line 43877=>to  be orc-stuff  for you, Mr.  Frodo,  I'm afraid. And for me too. If we go 
line 43878=>together, we'd best match. Now put this round you!' 
line 43879=>     Sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about Frodo's  shoulders. Then 
line 43880=>unslinging his pack he laid  it on the floor. He drew Sting from its sheath. 
line 43881=>Hardly a flicker was to be seen upon  its blade. `I was forgetting this, Mr. 
line 43882=>Frodo,' he said.  `No, they didn't get everything! You lent me Sting, if you  
line 43883=>remember, and the Lady's glass. I've  got them both still. But  lend them to 
line 43884=>me a little longer, Mr. Frodo. I must go  and see what  I can find. You stay 
line 43885=>here. Walk about a bit and ease your legs. I shan't be long.  I shan't  have 
line 43886=>to go far.' 
line 43887=>     `Take  care,  Sam!'  said Frodo. `And be quick! There may be orcs still 
line 43888=>alive, lurking in wait.' 
line 43889=>     'I've  got to chance  it,' said  Sam. He  stepped to the  trap-door and 
line 43890=>slipped down the ladder. In a  minute  his head reappeared. He threw  a long 
line 43891=>knife on the floor. 
line 43892=>     `There's something that might be  useful,' he said. 'He's dead: the one 
line 43893=>that  whipped  you. Broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. Now you draw  up 
line 43894=>the ladder, if  you can, Mr. Frodo;  and don't you let it down till you hear 
line 43895=>me call the password. Elbereth   I'll call. What  the Elves say. No orc would 
line 43896=>say that.' 
line 43897=> 
line 43898=>     Frodo sat  for a while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing one another 
line 43899=>through his mind. Then he  got up, drew the grey elven-cloak about him,  and 
line 43900=>to keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro, prying and peering into 
line 43901=>every corner of his prison. 
line 43902=>     It was not very long, though fear made it seem an hour at least, before 
line 43903=>he  heard Sam's voice calling softly from  below:  Elbereth, Elbereth . Frodo 
line 43904=>let  down the light ladder. Up  came Sam, puffing, heaving a great bundle on  
line 43905=>his head. He let it fall with a thud. 
line 43906=>     `Quick now. Mr.  Frodo!' he said. `I've had a  bit of  a search to find 
line 43907=>anything  small enough for the likes of us.  We'll have  to make do.  But we 
line 43908=>must hurry. I've met nothing alive, and  I've seen nothing but I'm not easy. 
line 43909=>I think this place is being watched. I can't explain it, but well: it  feels 
line 43910=>
line 43911=>####-to me as  if  one of those foul flying Riders was about, up in the blackness 
line 43912=>where he can't be seen.' 
line 43913=>     He opened  the  bundle. Frodo  looked in  disgust at  the contents, but 
line 43914=>there was nothing for it: he had to put the  things on, or go  naked.  There 
line 43915=>were  long hairy breeches of some unclean beast -fell,  and a  tunic of dirty 
line 43916=>leather. He  drew them on. Over the  tunic  went a coat  of stout ring-mail, 
line 43917=>short for  a  full-sized  orc,  too long for  Frodo  and heavy. About it  he 
line 43918=>clasped  a belt, at which there hung a  short  sheath holding a broad-bladed 
line 43919=>stabbing-sword.  Sam  had brought  several  orc-helmets. One of  them fitted  
line 43920=>Frodo well enough, a black  cap with iron rim, and  iron  hoops covered with 
line 43921=>leather  upon  which  the  evil  Eye was  painted  in red above the beaklike 
line 43922=>nose-guard. 
line 43923=>     `The Morgul-stuff,  Gorbag's gear,  was  a better fit and better made,' 
line 43924=>said Sam;  `but it  wouldn't do,  I  guess, to go  carrying his  tokens into 
line 43925=>Mordor,  not  after  this  business here. Well,  there you are, Mr. Frodo. A 
line 43926=>perfect little orc, if I may make so bold-at least you would be, if we could 
line 43927=>cover your face with a mask,  give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged. 
line 43928=>This  will  hide some of the tell-tales.' He put a large  black cloak  round 
line 43929=>Frodo's shoulders. `Now you're ready! You can pick up a shield as we go.' 
line 43930=>     'What about you, Sam?' said Frodo. `Aren't we going to match?' 
line 43931=>     `Well, Mr. Frodo, I've been  thinking,' said Sam. 'I'd best  not  leave 
line 43932=>any of my stuff behind, and we can't destroy it.  And  I can't wear orc-mail 
line 43933=>over all my clothes, can I? I'll just have to cover up.' 
line 43934=>     He knelt  down  and  carefully  folded his elven-cloak. It went  into a  
line 43935=>surprisingly small roll. This  he  put into his pack  that lay on the floor. 
line 43936=>Standing up, he slung  it behind his back,  put an orc-helm on  his head, and 
line 43937=>cast another  black cloak about  his  shoulders. `There!' he  said. `Now  we 
line 43938=>match, near enough. And now we must be off!' 
line 43939=>     'I can't go all the way at a run, Sam,' said Frodo with a wry smile. 'I  
line 43940=>hope you've made inquiries about inns along the road? Or  have you forgotten 
line 43941=>about food and drink?' 
line 43942=>     `Save me,  but so  I had!' said Sam.  He whistled in dismay. 'Bless me, 
line 43943=>Mr. Frodo, but you've gone and made me that hungry and thirsty! I don't know 
line 43944=>when   drop or  morsel last passed my lips. I'd forgotten it,  trying to find 
line 43945=>you.  But let  me  think!  Last time I looked  I'd got about enough of  that 
line 43946=>waybread, and of  what Captain Faramir gave us, to keep  me on my legs for a  
line 43947=>couple of weeks at a pinch. But if there's a drop left in my bottle, there's 
line 43948=>
line 43949=>####-no more. That's  not going to be enough for two, nohow. Don't ores eat,  and 
line 43950=>don't they drink? Or do they just live on foul air and poison?' 
line 43951=>     `No, they eat and drink, Sam. The Shadow that  bred them can only mock, 
line 43952=>it cannot make:  not real new things of its own. I  don't think it gave life 
line 43953=>to the ores, it only  ruined them and twisted them; and if they are  to live 
line 43954=>at all, they have to live like  other living creatures. Foul waters and foul 
line 43955=>meats  they'll  take, if they can get no better, but not poison. They've fed 
line 43956=>me, and so I'm better off than you. There must be food and  water  somewhere 
line 43957=>in this place.' `But there's no time to look for them,' said Sam. 
line 43958=>     `Well, things are a bit better than you think,' said Frodo. 'I have had 
line 43959=>a bit of luck while you were away. Indeed they did not take everything. I've 
line 43960=>found my food-bag among some  rags  on  the  floor.  They've rummaged it, of 
line 43961=>course. But I  guess  they disliked  the very look and smell of  the lembas, 
line 43962=>worse than Gollum did. It's scattered about  and some  of it is trampled and 
line 43963=>broken,  but I've gathered  it  together. It's not far short of  what you've 
line 43964=>got.   But  they've   taken  Faramir's  food,  and  they've  slashed  up  my 
line 43965=>water -bottle.' 
line 43966=>     `Well,  there's no more  to  be said,' said  Sam. `We've got enough  to 
line 43967=>start  on.  But the water's going to be a  bad business. But come Mr. Frodo!  
line 43968=>Off we go, or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!' 
line 43969=>     'Not  till you've  had  a mouthful,  Sam,' said Frodo. `I won't  budge. 
line 43970=>Here, take this elven-cake, and  drink that last drop in  your  bottle!  The 
line 43971=>whole thing is quite hopeless, so it's no good worrying  about  tomorrow. It 
line 43972=>probably won't come.' 
line 43973=> 
line 43974=>     At last they started. Down the ladder  they climbed, and then Sam  took  
line 43975=>it and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc. The 
line 43976=>stair was dark, but on the roof-top the glare of the Mountain could still be 
line 43977=>seen, though it  was dying down  now to  a  sullen red.  They  picked up two 
line 43978=>shields to complete their disguise and then went on. 
line 43979=>     Down  the great stairway they plodded. The  high chamber of the  turret 
line 43980=>behind, where they had met again, seemed almost homely: they were out in the 
line 43981=>open again  now,  and terror ran along  the walls. All might be  dead in the 
line 43982=>Tower of Cirith Ungol, but it was steeped in fear and evil still. 
line 43983=>     At length they came to the door upon the outer court, and they  halted. 
line 43984=>Even  from where they stood they felt the malice  of the Watchers beating on 
line 43985=>them, black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare 
line 43986=>
line 43987=>####-of Mordor dimly showed. As they threaded their way among the hideous  
line 43988=>bodies 
line 43989=>of the  ores each step became more  difficult. Before they  even reached the 
line 43990=>archway they were brought to a stand. To move an inch further was a pain and 
line 43991=>weariness to will and limb. 
line 43992=>     Frodo  had no  strength  for such a  battle. He sank  to the ground. `I  
line 43993=>can't go  on, Sam,' he  murmured. `I'm  going  to faint. I don't know what's 
line 43994=>come over me.' 
line 43995=>     `I  do, Mr.  Frodo. Hold up  now! It's  the gate.  There's some devilry 
line 43996=>there. But  I got  through,  and  I'm going to  get  out.  It can't be  more 
line 43997=>dangerous than before. Now for it!' 
line 43998=>     Sam drew  out the elven-glass of Galadriel again. As if to do honour to 
line 43999=>his hardihood, and to grace with  splendour  his faithful  brown hobbit-hand  
line 44000=>that had done such  deeds, the  phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the 
line 44001=>shadowy  court  was  lit with  a  dazzling  radiance  like lightning; but it 
line 44002=>remained steady and did not pass.  
line 44003=>     'Gilthoniel, A  Elbereth!' Sam  cried. For, why he  did  not know,  his 
line 44004=>thought sprang back suddenly to  the Elves in the Shire,  and the song  that 
line 44005=>drove away the Black Rider in the trees.  
line 44006=>     'Aiya elenion ancalima!' cried Frodo once again behind him. 
line 44007=>     The will of the Watchers was broken with a suddenness like the snapping  
line 44008=>of a cord, and Frodo and Sam stumbled  forward. Then they  ran.  Through the 
line 44009=>gate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes. There was 
line 44010=>a crack.  The keystone of the  arch  crashed almost on  their heels, and the 
line 44011=>wall  above crumbled, and fell in ruin. Only  by a  hair did  they escape. A 
line 44012=>bell clanged; and from the Watchers there went up  a high and dreadful wail.  
line 44013=>Far  up above in  the darkness it was answered . Out of the  black  sky there 
line 44014=>came dropping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with  a ghastly  
line 44015=>shriek. 
line 44016=> 
line 44017=>
line 44018=>####- 
line 44019=>
line 44020=>Chapter 2. The Land of Shadow 
line 44021=>
line 44022=> 
line 44023=> 
line 44024=>     Sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast. 
line 44025=>'Run, Mr. Frodo!' he cried.  'No, not that way! There's a sheer drop over the 
line 44026=>wall. Follow me!' 
line 44027=>     Down the  road from the  gate they  fled. In fifty paces, with a  swift  
line 44028=>bend  round  a jutting bastion  of the cliff, it took them out of sight from 
line 44029=>the Tower.  They had escaped for the moment. Cowering back  against the rock  
line 44030=>they drew breath, and then they clutched at their  hearts.  Perching  now on 
line 44031=>the wall  beside the ruined  gate the Nazgyl sent out its  deadly cries. All 
line 44032=>the cliffs echoed. 
line 44033=>     In terror they  stumbled  on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward again 
line 44034=>and exposed them  for  a dreadful  moment  to view from  the Tower. As  they 
line 44035=>flitted  across they  glanced  back  and saw the  great black shape upon the 
line 44036=>battlement; then they plunged down between high rock -walls in a cu tting that 
line 44037=>fell steeply to join  the  Morgul-road. They came to  the way-meeting. There 
line 44038=>was still  no sign of orcs, nor  of  an answer to the cry of the Nazgyl; but 
line 44039=>they  knew that the silence would not last  long. At any moment now the hunt 
line 44040=>would begin. 
line 44041=>     'This won't do, Sam,' said Frodo. 'If we were real orcs, we ought to be 
line 44042=>dashing back  to the  Tower, not running away. The  first enemy we meet will 
line 44043=>know us. We must get off this road somehow.' 
line 44044=>     'But we can't,' said Sam, 'not without wings.' 
line 44045=>     The eastern faces of the Ephel D®ath  were  sheer, falling in cliff and 
line 44046=>precipice to the black trough that lay between  them  and the inner ridge. A 
line 44047=>short way beyond the  way-meeting,  after another  steep  incline,  a flying 
line 44048=>bridge  of stone  leapt over the chasm  and  bore  the road  across into the 
line 44049=>tumbled slopes and glens of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt Frodo and Sam 
line 44050=>dashed along the bridge;  but  they had  hardly reached its further end when 
line 44051=>they  heard  the hue and cry begin. Away  behind them, now high above on the 
line 44052=>mountain-side, loomed  the  Tower of Cirith Ungol, its stones glowing dully. 
line 44053=>Suddenly its harsh bell clanged  again, and  then broke  into  a  shattering 
line 44054=>peal.  Horns sounded.  And now  from beyond  the  bridge-end came  
line 44055=>answering 
line 44056=>cries. Down in the dark trough,  cut off from the dying  glare of  Orodruin, 
line 44057=>
line 44058=>####-Frodo  and  Sam  could not see ahead, but  already  they heard the  tramp of 
line 44059=>iron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs. 
line 44060=>     'Quick, Sam!  Over we  go!'  cried Frodo. They scrambled  on to  the low 
line 44061=>parapet of the  bridge. Fortunately there  was no  longer any dreadful  drop 
line 44062=>into the  gulf, for the slopes of the Morgai had already risen almost to the 
line 44063=>level of the road;  but it was too dark for them to  guess  the depth of the 
line 44064=>fall. 
line 44065=>     'Well, here goes, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'Good-bye!' 
line 44066=>     He let go. Frodo followed. And even as they fell they heard the rush of 
line 44067=>horsemen sweeping over  the bridge  and  the rattle  of orc-feet  running up 
line 44068=>behind. But Sam would have laughed, if he had dared. Half fearing a breaking 
line 44069=>plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than 
line 44070=>a dozen feet, with a thud  and  a crunch  into the last  thing that they had 
line 44071=>expected: a tangle of thorny bushes.  There Sam  lay still, softly sucking a  
line 44072=>scratched hand. 
line 44073=>     When  the sound of  hoof  and foot  had passed  he ventured a  whisper. 
line 44074=>'Bless me, Mr. Frodo, but I didn't know as anything grew in Mordor! But if I 
line 44075=>had a'known, this is just what I'd have  looked  for. These thorns must be a  
line 44076=>foot long by the feel of them; they've stuck through everything I've got on. 
line 44077=>Wish I'd a'put that mail -shirt on!' 
line 44078=>     'Orc-mail  doesn't keep  these thorns out,'  said Frodo.  'Not  even  a  
line 44079=>leather jerkin is any good.' 
line 44080=>     They had a  struggle  to get out of the thicket. The thorns  and briars 
line 44081=>were as tough as wire and as  clinging as  claws. Their cloaks were rent and 
line 44082=>tattered before they broke free at last. 
line 44083=>     'Now down we  go, Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'Down into  the  valley quick , 
line 44084=>and then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.' 
line 44085=>     Day was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of 
line 44086=>Mordor the Sun  was climbing over the eastern  rim of Middle-earth; but here 
line 44087=>all was still dark as night. The Mountain smoulder ed and its fires went out. 
line 44088=>The glare  faded from the cliffs.  The easterly wind that  had  been blowing 
line 44089=>ever since  they  left  Ithilien now seemed dead.  Slowly and painfully they 
line 44090=>clambered down, groping, stumbling, scrambling among rock and briar and 
line 44091=>dead 
line 44092=>wood in the blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further. 
line 44093=>     At  length they stopped, and sat  side  by  side, their backs against a  
line 44094=>boulder. Both were sweating.  'If Shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of 
line 44095=>
line 44096=>####-water, I'd shake his hand,' said Sam. 
line 44097=>     'Don't say such things!' said Frodo. 'It only makes it  worse.' Then he 
line 44098=>stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while. At 
line 44099=>last with a struggle he got up again. To his amazement he found that Sam was 
line 44100=>asleep.  'Wake  up,  Sam!'  he  said. 'Come on! It's time  we  made  another 
line 44101=>effort.' 
line 44102=>     Sam scrambled  to  his feet.  'Well I  never!' he  said.  'I  must have 
line 44103=>dropped off. It's a long time, Mr. Frodo, since I had a proper sleep, and my 
line 44104=>eyes just closed down on their own.' 
line 44105=>     Frodo now led the way, northward as near as he could  guess,  among the 
line 44106=>stones  and boulders lying thick at  the bottom of  the  great  ravine.  But 
line 44107=>presently he stopped again. 
line 44108=>     'It's no good, Sam,' he said. 'I  can't  manage  it. This mail-shirt, I 
line 44109=>mean. Not in my present state. Even my mithril-coat seemed heavy when I  was 
line 44110=>tired. This is far heavier. And what's the use of it? We shan't win  through 
line 44111=>by fighting.' 
line 44112=>     'But we may  have some to do,' said  Sam. 'And there's knives and stray 
line 44113=>arrows. That  Gollum isn't dead, for one thing. I don't like to think of you  
line 44114=>with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark.' 
line 44115=>     'Look here, Sam dear lad,' said Frodo: 'I am tired, weary,  I haven't a  
line 44116=>hope left.  But I have to go on trying to get  to the Mountain, as long as I 
line 44117=>can move. The  Ring is enough. This extra  weight is killing me. It must go. 
line 44118=>But don't think  I'm ungrateful. I hate  to think of the foul work  you must  
line 44119=>have had among the bodies to find it for me.' 
line 44120=>     'Don't talk about it, Mr. Frodo. Bless you! I'd  carry you  on my back, 
line 44121=>if I could. Let it go then!' 
line 44122=>     Frodo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it away. 
line 44123=>He shivered a little. 'What I really need is something warm,' he said. 'It's 
line 44124=>gone cold, or else I've caught a chill.' 
line 44125=>     'You can have my cloak,  Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. He unslung his  pack and  
line 44126=>took out the elven-cloak. 'How's  this, Mr.  Frodo?' he said. 'You wrap that 
line 44127=>orc-rag close round you, and  put the belt outside it. Then this can go over 
line 44128=>all.  It  don't  look quite orc-fashion, but it'll  keep you  warmer; and  I 
line 44129=>daresay it'll  keep you from harm better than any other gear. It was made by 
line 44130=>the Lady.' 
line 44131=>     Frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch. 'That's better!' he said. 
line 44132=>'I feel much lighter. I  can go  on now.  But this  blind dark  seems to  be 
line 44133=>
line 44134=>####-getting into my  heart.  As I lay in  prison,  Sam. I tried to  remember the 
line 44135=>Brandywine, and  Woody  End,  and  The  Water  running  through  the mill at 
line 44136=>Hobbiton. But I can't see them now.' 
line 44137=>     'There  now, Mr.  Frodo, it's you  that's  talking of water this time!' 
line 44138=>said Sam. 'If only the  Lady could see us or hear us, I'd say to  her: (Your 
line 44139=>Ladyship,  all  we  want is  light  and  water:  just clean water and  plain 
line 44140=>daylight, better than any jewels,  begging your pardon.( But it's a long way 
line 44141=>to Lurien.' Sam sighed and waved his  hand towards the heights of the  Ephel 
line 44142=>D®ath, now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky. 
line 44143=> 
line 44144=>     They  started  off again. They  had not gone  far  when  Frodo  paused.  
line 44145=>'There's a Black Rider over us,' he said. 'I can feel it. We had better keep 
line 44146=>still for a while.' 
line 44147=>     Crouched under  a great  boulder they sat facing back  westward and did 
line 44148=>not speak  for some  time. Then  Frodo  breathed  a  sigh of  relief.  'It's 
line 44149=>passed,' he said.  They  stood up, and then they both stared in wonder. Away 
line 44150=>to their left, southward, against a sky that was turning grey, the peaks and 
line 44151=>high  ridges  of  the great range began  to appear  dark and black,  visible 
line 44152=>shapes. Light  was growing behind them.  Slowly it crept towards the  North. 
line 44153=>There  was battle far above  in  the high spaces of the  air. The  billowing 
line 44154=>clouds of Mordor were being driven back, their edges tattering as a wind out 
line 44155=>of  the living world came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark 
line 44156=>land of their home. Under  the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light 
line 44157=>leaked into Mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison. 
line 44158=>     'Look at it, Mr. Frodo!'  said  Sam. 'Look  at it!  The wind's changed. 
line 44159=>Something's happening. He's not having it all  his own way.  His darkness is 
line 44160=>breaking up out in the world there. I wish I could see what is going on!' 
line 44161=>     It was  the morning  of the fifteenth of  March,  and over the  Vale of 
line 44162=>Anduin the Sun was rising  above the eastern shadow, and the south-west wind 
line 44163=>was blowing. Thjoden lay dying on the Pelennor Fields.  
line 44164=>     As Frodo and Sam stood and gazed, the rim of light spread all along the 
line 44165=>line  of the Ephel D®ath, and then they saw a shape, moving at a great speed 
line 44166=>out of  the West, at first only a  black speck against  the glimmering strip 
line 44167=>above the mountain-tops, but  growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the 
line 44168=>dark canopy and passed high above them. As it went it sent out a long shrill  
line 44169=>cry, the voice of a Nazgyl; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: 
line 44170=>it was a cry of woe and dismay, ill tidings for the Dark Tower. The Lord  of 
line 44171=>
line 44172=>####-the Ring-wraiths had met his doom. 
line 44173=>     'What did I tell you? Something's happening!'  cried Sam. '  (The  war's 
line 44174=>going well,(  said Shagrat; but Gorbag he  wasn't so sure. And  he was right 
line 44175=>there too. Things are looking up, Mr. Frodo. Haven't you got some hope now?' 
line 44176=>     'Well  no,  not much,  Sam,'  Frodo  sighed. 'That's  away  beyond  the 
line 44177=>mountains.  We're going east not west. And I'm  so tired. And the Ring  is so  
line 44178=>heavy, Sam.  And  I begin to  see it in my mind  all the time, like a  great 
line 44179=>wheel of fire.' 
line 44180=>     Sam's  quick  spirits  sank again  at  once. He  looked  at  his master  
line 44181=>anxiously, and he took his hand.  'Come, Mr.  Frodo!' he said. 'I've got one 
line 44182=>thing  I  wanted: a bit of light. Enough  to help  us, and yet I guess  it's 
line 44183=>dangerous too. Try a bit further,  and then we'll lie close and have a rest. 
line 44184=>But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the E lves' food; it may hearten you.' 
line 44185=>     Sharing  a  wafer of   lembas, and  munching it as  best they could with 
line 44186=>their parched  mouths. Frodo and Sam  plodded on. The light,  though no more 
line 44187=>than a grey  dusk, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the 
line 44188=>valley  between  the mountains. It sloped  up gently  northward,  and at its 
line 44189=>bottom  went the bed  of a now dry  and  withered stream.  Beyond  its stony 
line 44190=>course  they saw a beaten  path that  wound  its way under the  feet of  the 
line 44191=>westward cliffs. Had they known,  they could have reached it quicker, for it 
line 44192=>was a track that  left the main Morgul-road at the  western  bridge-end  and 
line 44193=>went down  by  a long stair cut in the rock to the valley's  bottom.  It was 
line 44194=>used  by  patrols  or  by  messengers going  swiftly  to  lesser  posts  and 
line 44195=>strongholds north-away, between Cirith Ungol and the narrows of  Isenmouthe, 
line 44196=>the iron jaws of Carach Angren. 
line 44197=>     It was  perilous for the hobbits to use  such  a path,  but they needed 
line 44198=>speed, and  Frodo felt that he could not face the  toil of  scrambling among 
line 44199=>the boulders or in the trackless glens  of  the Morgai. And  he  judged that 
line 44200=>northward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would least expect them  to 
line 44201=>take.  The  road east  to the plain, or the pass back westward,  those  they 
line 44202=>would first search most thoroughly. Only when he was well north of the Tower  
line 44203=>did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east, east on the last 
line 44204=>desperate  stage of his journey. So now  they crossed the stony bed and took  
line 44205=>to  the orc-path, and  for some time  they  marched along  it. The cliffs at 
line 44206=>their left  were overhung, and they could  not be seen  from above; but  the 
line 44207=>path made many bends, and at each  bend they  gripped their  sword-hilts and 
line 44208=>went forward cautiously. 
line 44209=>
line 44210=>####-     The  light grew no stronger,  for  Orodruin was still belching forth  a  
line 44211=>great  fume that, beaten  upwards by  the  opposing airs, mounted higher and  
line 44212=>higher,  until it  reached  a  region  above  the  wind  and  spread  in  an 
line 44213=>immeasurable roof, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their 
line 44214=>view. They had  trudged for more than an hour  when they heard a sound  that 
line 44215=>brought them to a halt. Unbelievable, but unmistakable. Water trickling. Out 
line 44216=>of a gully on the left, so sharp  and narrow  that it look ed as if the black  
line 44217=>cliff had been cloven by some  huge  axe, water came dripping down: the last 
line 44218=>remains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered  from sunlit seas, but ill-fated 
line 44219=>to  fall at last upon the walls of  the Black Land and wander fruitless down 
line 44220=>into  the dust. Here it came out of  the rock in a little falling streamlet, 
line 44221=>and  flowed  across the path, and turning south  ran away swiftly to be lost  
line 44222=>among the dead stones.  
line 44223=>     Sam sprang towards it. 'If ever I see the Lady again, I will tell her!' 
line 44224=>he cried . 'Light  and now  water!' Then he stopped. 'Let me  drink first Mr. 
line 44225=>Frodo,' he said. 
line 44226=>     'All right, but there's room enough for two.' 
line 44227=>     'I didn't  mean  that,'  said  Sam.  'I  mean:  if it's  poisonous,  or  
line 44228=>something  that will  show  its  badness quick, well,  better me  than  you, 
line 44229=>master, if you understand me.' 
line 44230=>     'I do. But I think we'll trust our luck together, Sam; or our blessing. 
line 44231=>Still, be careful now, if it's very cold!' 
line 44232=>     The water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, a t once 
line 44233=>bitter and  oily, or  so they would have said at home. Here it seemed beyond 
line 44234=>all  praise, and beyond fear  or  prudence. They  drank their  fill, and Sam 
line 44235=>replenished his water -bottle. After that Frodo felt easier, and they went on 
line 44236=>for several miles, until the broadening of the road and  the beginnings of a  
line 44237=>rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another  
line 44238=>orc-hold. 
line 44239=>     'This  is  where  we  turn aside, Sam,' said  Frodo. 'And we  must turn 
line 44240=>east.'  He  sighed as he looked a t  the gloomy ridges across the  valley. 'I  
line 44241=>have just about  enough strength left to find  some hole  away up there. And  
line 44242=>then I must rest a little.' 
line 44243=>     The river -bed  was now some way  below the path. They scrambled down to 
line 44244=>it,  and began to cross  it. To their surprise they came upon dark pools fed 
line 44245=>by  threads  of water trickling down from some source  higher up the valley.  
line 44246=>
line 44247=>####-Upon its  outer marges under the westward mountains Mordor was a dying 
line 44248=>land, 
line 44249=>but it was not yet dead. And here things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter, 
line 44250=>struggling  for life. In  the glens of the Morgai on the other  side  of the 
line 44251=>valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought  
line 44252=>with the stones,  and withered mosses crawled on them; and  everywhere great 
line 44253=>writhing, tangled brambles sprawled. Some  had  long stabbing  thorns,  some 
line 44254=>hooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen shrivelled leaves of  a  past  
line 44255=>year  hung on  them,  grating  and  rattling  in  the  sad airs,  but  their 
line 44256=>maggot-ridden buds were  only  just  opening. Flies,  dun or grey, or black, 
line 44257=>marked like ores with a red  eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung;  and above 
line 44258=>the briar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled. 
line 44259=>     'Orc-gear's no  good,' said Sam, waving his  arms. 'I  wish I'd  got  an 
line 44260=>orc's hide!' 
line 44261=>     At  last Frodo  could  go  no further.  They had  climbed  up  a narrow 
line 44262=>shelving ravine, but  they still had a long way to go before they could even 
line 44263=>come in sight of the last craggy ridge. 'I must rest  now, Sam, and sleep if 
line 44264=>I can.' said Frodo.  He looked  about, but there seemed  nowhere even for an 
line 44265=>animal to crawl into  in this  dismal  country.  At length,  tired out, they 
line 44266=>slunk  under a  curtain  of brambles that hung  down  like a  mat over a low 
line 44267=>rock-face. 
line 44268=>     There  they sat and  made such a meal as they could. Keeping  back  the 
line 44269=>precious  lembas for the evil days ahead, they ate the half of what remained 
line 44270=>in Sam's bag of Faramir's provision: some  dried fruit, and a small  slip of 
line 44271=>cured meat; and they sipped some water. They  had drunk again from the pools 
line 44272=>in the valley, but they were very, thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in 
line 44273=>the air of Mordor  that dried the mouth. When Sam thought of water  even his 
line 44274=>hopeful spirit quailed.  Beyond  the Morgai there was the dreadful plain  of 
line 44275=>Gorgoroth to cross.  
line 44276=>     'Now  you go to  sleep first, Mr. Frodo,' he said.  'It's getting  dark 
line 44277=>again. I reckon this day is nearly over.' 
line 44278=>     Frodo sighed and was  asleep almost before  the words were  spoken. Sam 
line 44279=>struggled with his own weariness, and he took Frodo's hand; and there he sat 
line 44280=>silent till deep night fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled 
line 44281=>from  the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking  and 
line 44282=>cracking and sly noises, but there was  no  sound of  voice or  of foot. Far 
line 44283=>above the  Ephel D®ath  in the West  the night-sky  was still dim and  pale. 
line 44284=>
line 44285=>####-There,  peeping among the cloud-wrack  above  a  dark  tor high  up  in  the 
line 44286=>mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for  a while. The beauty of it smote  
line 44287=>his heart, as he looked  up  out  of the forsaken land, and hope returned to 
line 44288=>him. For like  a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced  him that in the 
line 44289=>end the Shadow was  only a small and passing thing: there was light and high 
line 44290=>beauty for ever beyond  its reach. His song in  the Tower had been  defiance 
line 44291=>rather  than hope;  for  then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment,  
line 44292=>his own fate,  and even his masters, ceased to trouble him. He crawled  back  
line 44293=>into the  brambles and  laid  himself by Frodo's side ,  and putting away all 
line 44294=>fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep. 
line 44295=>     They woke  together, hand in  hand.  Sam was  almost fresh,  ready  for  
line 44296=>another day; but Frodo sighed.  His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of 
line 44297=>fire, and  waking  brought  him no comfort.  Still  his sleep  had not  been 
line 44298=>without  all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able  to  bear his burden 
line 44299=>one stage further. They did not know the time, nor how long  they had slept;  
line 44300=>but after a morsel of food and a sip of water  they went  on up  the ravine, 
line 44301=>until it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones. There the last  
line 44302=>living things gave up their struggle; the tops of the Morgai were grassless,  
line 44303=>bare, jagged, barren as a slate. 
line 44304=>     After much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb, 
line 44305=>and with a last hundred feet  of clawing scramble they were up. They came to 
line 44306=>a cleft between two dark crags, and passing through found  themselves on the 
line 44307=>very edge of the last  fence of Mordor. Below them, at the  bottom of a fall 
line 44308=>of  some fifteen hundred feet,  lay  the inner plain stretching away into  a  
line 44309=>formless gloom beyond their sight. The wind  of the world blew now from  the 
line 44310=>West, and  the great clouds  were lifted  high,  floating away eastward; but 
line 44311=>still only a grey  light came to the dreary fields of Gorgoroth. There smokes 
line 44312=>trailed on the ground and lurked in hollows, and fumes  leaked from fissures 
line 44313=>in the earth. 
line 44314=>     Still far away, forty  miles  at least,  they  saw Mount Doom, its feet 
line 44315=>founded in  ashen ruin, its huge cone rising  to  a great height,  where its 
line 44316=>reeking  head was swathed in cloud. Its fires were now  dimmed, and it stood 
line 44317=>in smouldering slumber, as threatening and  dangerous as a  sleeping  beast.  
line 44318=>Behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of 
line 44319=>Barad-dyr  that was  reared far  way upon a long spur of the Ashen Mountains 
line 44320=>thrust down from the North. The Dark Power was deep in  thought, and the Eye 
line 44321=>turned inward, pondering tidings of doubt and danger: a  bright sword, and a  
line 44322=>
line 44323=>####-stern  and kingly face  it  saw, and for  a while it gave  little thought to 
line 44324=>other things;  and  all its great  stronghold, gate on  gate,  and tower  on 
line 44325=>tower, was wrapped in a brooding gloom. 
line 44326=>     Frodo and Sam gazed out in  mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful 
line 44327=>land. Between them and  the smoking mountain, and about  it north and south, 
line 44328=>all seemed ruinous and dead, a  desert burned  and choked. They wondered 
line 44329=>how 
line 44330=>the Lord of  this realm maintained  and  fed his  slaves and his armies. Yet 
line 44331=>armies he had.  As far as their  eyes could reach, along the  skirts  of the 
line 44332=>Morgai and away southward,  there were camps, some  of tents,  some  ordered 
line 44333=>like small towns. One of the largest of these was right below them. Barely a  
line 44334=>mile  out into  the  plain it clustered like some huge nest of insects, with 
line 44335=>straight dreary streets of huts  and  long low drab buildings. About it  the 
line 44336=>ground  was  busy  with folk  going  to and  fro; a  wide  road  ran from it 
line 44337=>south-east to join the  Morgul-way, and along it  many  lines of small black  
line 44338=>shapes were hurrying. 
line 44339=>     'I don't like the look of things at all,' said Sam. 'Pretty hopeless, I 
line 44340=>call it  - saving that where there's such  a lot of folk  there must be wells 
line 44341=>or water, not to mention  food. And these  are Men not Orcs,  or  my eyes are 
line 44342=>all wrong.' 
line 44343=>     Neither  he nor Frodo knew  anything of  the great slave-worked  fields 
line 44344=>away south  in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the Mountain by the dark 
line 44345=>sad waters  of Lake  N®rnen; nor of  the great roads that ran away  east and 
line 44346=>south to tributary lands, from which the soldiers of the Tower  brought long  
line 44347=>waggon-trains of goods  and booty and fresh  slaves. Here  in  the northward 
line 44348=>regions were the mines and forges, and the musterings of  long-planned  war; 
line 44349=>and  here the  Dark  Power, moving its armies like pieces on the  board, was 
line 44350=>gathering them together. Its first moves, the first feelers of its strength, 
line 44351=>had been  checked  upon  its western  line, southward and northward. For the 
line 44352=>moment  it withdrew  them,  and  brought  up new forces, massing  them about 
line 44353=>Cirith Gorgor for an avenging stroke. And if it had also been its purpose to 
line 44354=>defend the Mountain against all approach, it could scarcely have done more. 
line 44355=>     'Well!' Sam went on. 'Whatever they have to eat and drink, we can't get 
line 44356=>it. There's no way down that I can see. And we couldn't cross  all that open 
line 44357=>country crawling with enemies, even if we did get down.' 
line 44358=>     'Still  we  shall  have to  try,'  said  Frodo.  'It's  no worse than I 
line 44359=>expected. I never hoped to get across. I can't see any  hope  of it now. But 
line 44360=>
line 44361=>####-I've  still  got  to do the best I can. At  present that  is to avoid  being 
line 44362=>captured  as long as possible.  So we must still go northwards, I think, and 
line 44363=>see what it is like where the open plain is narrower.' 
line 44364=>     'I guess what it'll be like,' said  Sam. 'Where it's narrower the  Orcs 
line 44365=>and Men will just be packed closer. You'll see, Mr. Frodo.' 
line 44366=>     'I dare say I shall, if  we ever get so  far,'  said  Frodo  and turned 
line 44367=>away. 
line 44368=>     They  soon  found that it was impossible  to  make their way  along the 
line 44369=>crest of  the Morgai, or anywhere along its  higher levels, pathless as they 
line 44370=>were  and scored with deep ghylls. In the end they were  forced to  go  back  
line 44371=>down the ravine that they had  climbed and seek for a way  along the valley. 
line 44372=>It was  rough going,  for  they  dared not  cross  over  to the  path on the 
line 44373=>westward side. After a mile or more  they  saw,  huddled in a  hollow at the 
line 44374=>cliff's foot,  the orc-hold that  they had guessed  was near at hand: a wall 
line 44375=>and a cluster of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave. There was no  
line 44376=>movement to be seen, but the hobbits crept by cautiously, keeping as much as 
line 44377=>they  could  to the thorn-brakes that  grew thickly at this point along both 
line 44378=>sides of the old water -course. 
line 44379=>     They went two or three miles further, and  the orc-hold was hidden from 
line 44380=>sight behind them; but  they had hardly begun  to breathe  more freely again 
line 44381=>when harsh and loud they heard orc-voices. Quickly  they  slunk out of sight 
line 44382=>behind a brown and stunted bush.  The voices drew nearer. Presently two orcs 
line 44383=>came  into view. One was  clad in ragged  brown and was armed with a  bow of 
line 44384=>horn;  it was of  a small  breed, black -skinned,  with  wide  and  snuffling 
line 44385=>nostrils:  evidently  a   tracker  of  some  kind.  The  other  was   a  big 
line 44386=>fighting-orc, like those of Shagrat's company, bearing the token of the Eye. 
line 44387=>He  also had  a  bow at his back and carried  a short broad-headed spear. As 
line 44388=>usual they  were  quarrelling, and  being of  different breeds they used the 
line 44389=>Common Speech a fter their fashion. 
line 44390=>     Hardly  twenty  paces  from where the  hobbits  lurked  the  small  orc 
line 44391=>stopped. 'Nar!' it snarled. 'I'm going  home.' It  pointed across the valley 
line 44392=>to  the orc-hold. 'No good wearing my nose out  on  stones any more. There's 
line 44393=>not a  trace left, I say. I've lost the scent through  giving way to you. It 
line 44394=>went up into the hills, not along the valley, I tell you.' 
line 44395=>     'Not  much use  are you,  you little snufflers?' said the  big  orc. 'I  
line 44396=>reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses.' 
line 44397=>     'Then what  have  you  seen with them?' snarled the  other.  'Garn! You  
line 44398=>
line 44399=>####-don't even know what you're looking for.' 
line 44400=>     'Whose  blame's that?'  said the  soldier. 'Not mine. That  comes  from 
line 44401=>Higher Up.  First they  say  it's a great Elf in bright armour, then  it's a  
line 44402=>sort of small dwarf-man, then it must be a pack of rebel Uruk -hai; or  maybe  
line 44403=>it's all the lot together.' 
line 44404=>     'Ar!' said the tracker. 'They've lost their  heads, that's what it  is.  
line 44405=>And some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too, I guess, if what I 
line 44406=>hear is true: Tower raided and all, and hundreds of your  lads done in,  and 
line 44407=>prisoner got  away.  If that's  the  way you fighters  go on,  small  wonder 
line 44408=>there's bad news from the battles.' 
line 44409=>     'Who says there's bad news?' shouted the soldier. 
line 44410=>     'Ar! Who says there isn't?' 
line 44411=>     'That's cursed rebel-talk, and I'll  stick  you, if  you don't shut  it 
line 44412=>down, see?' 
line 44413=>     'All right, all right!' said  the tracker. 'I'll say  no more and go on 
line 44414=>thinking.  But what's  the black  sneak got to do with  it all? That gobbler  
line 44415=>with the flapping hands?' 
line 44416=>     'I  don't know. Nothing, maybe.  But he's up to no good, nosing around, 
line 44417=>I'll  wager. Curse him! No sooner had  he slipped us and run  off than  word 
line 44418=>came he's wanted alive, wanted quick.' 
line 44419=>     'Well,  I hope they  get  him and  put him  through  it,'  growled  the 
line 44420=>tracker.  'He  messed up  the  scent  back  there,  pinching  that  cast -off 
line 44421=>mail-shirt  that he  found,  and paddling all round the place before I could 
line 44422=>get there.' 
line 44423=>     'It  saved his  life anyhow,' said  the soldier. 'Why, before I knew he 
line 44424=>was wanted I shot him, as neat as neat, at fifty  paces  right in the  back; 
line 44425=>but he ran on.' 
line 44426=>     'Garn!  You missed him,' said the  tracker. 'First you shoot wild, then 
line 44427=>you run too  slow, and then you  send for the poor trackers. I've had enough 
line 44428=>of you.' He loped off. 
line 44429=>     'You come back,' shouted the soldier, 'or I'll report you!' 
line 44430=>     'Who to? Not to your precious Shagrat. He won't be captain any more.' 
line 44431=>     'I'll  give  your  name and  number  to the Nazgyl,'  said  the soldier  
line 44432=>lowering his voice to a hiss. 'One of them's in charge at the Tower now.' 
line 44433=>     The other halted, and his voice was  full of fear and rage. 'You cursed 
line 44434=>peaching sneakthief!' he yelled. 'You can't do  your job, and you can't even 
line 44435=>stick by your own folk. Go to your filthy Shriekers, and may they freeze the 
line 44436=>
line 44437=>####-flesh off you! If the enemy  doesn't get them  first. They've done in Number  
line 44438=>One, I've heard, and I hope it's true!' 
line 44439=>     The big orc, spear in hand, leapt after him. But the tracker, springing 
line 44440=>behind  a  stone,  put an arrow in  his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a  
line 44441=>crash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared. 
line 44442=>     For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length  Sam stirred. 'Well I 
line 44443=>call  that  neat as neat,'  he said. 'If this nice friendliness would spread 
line 44444=>about in Mordor, half our trouble would be over.' 
line 44445=>     'Quietly,  Sam,' Frodo whispered. 'There  may be  others about. We have 
line 44446=>evidently had  a very narrow escape,  and the  hunt was hotter on our tracks 
line 44447=>than we guessed. But that is the spirit of Mordor, Sam; and it has spread to 
line 44448=>every corner of it. Orcs have always behaved like that, or so all tales say, 
line 44449=>when they are on their own. But you can't get much hope out of it. They hate 
line 44450=>us far  more,  altogether  and all the time. If  those two had seen us, they 
line 44451=>would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.' 
line 44452=>     There was another long silence. Sam broke it again,  but with a whisper  
line 44453=>this time.  'Did you hear what they  said  about  that gobbler, Mr.  Frodo? I 
line 44454=>told you Gollum wasn't dead yet, didn't I?' 
line 44455=>     'Yes, I remember. And I wondered  how you knew,' said Frodo. 'Well come 
line 44456=>now!  I think we had better not move out from here again,  until it has gone 
line 44457=>quite dark. So  you shall tell me how you know, a nd all about what happened. 
line 44458=>If you can do it quietly.' 
line 44459=>     'I'll try,' said Sam, 'but when I think of  that Stinker I get so hot l 
line 44460=>could shout.' 
line 44461=>     There the hobbits sat under the  cover  of  the  thorny bush, while the 
line 44462=>drear light of  Mordor faded slowly into a deep and starless night; and  Sam 
line 44463=>spoke into Frodo's  ear  all  that he  could  find  words  for  of  Gollum's 
line 44464=>treacherous  attack, the  horror of Shelob, and his  own adventures with the 
line 44465=>orcs. When  he  had finished,  Frodo said nothing  but  took  Sam's hand and  
line 44466=>pressed it. At length he stirred. 
line 44467=>     'Well, I  suppose  we  must be going on  again,' he said. 'I wonder how 
line 44468=>long it will be before  we really are  caught  and all the  toiling and  the 
line 44469=>slinking will be over, and in vain.'  He stood up. 'It's dark, and we cannot 
line 44470=>use the  Lady's glass. Keep it safe  for me, Sam. I  have nowhere to keep it 
line 44471=>now, except in my hand, and  I shall need both hands in the blind night. But 
line 44472=>Sting I give to you. I have  got an orc-blade, but I do not think it will be 
line 44473=>my part to strike any blow again.' 
line 44474=>
line 44475=>####-     It  was difficult and dangerous moving in  the  night  in the  pathless 
line 44476=>land; but slowly and with much  stumbling the two hobbits  toiled on hour by 
line 44477=>hour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley. When a grey light 
line 44478=>crept back over the western  heights, long after day had opened in the lands 
line 44479=>beyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. In his 
line 44480=>times  of waking  Sam  was busy  with thoughts  of food. At  last when Frodo 
line 44481=>roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet  another effort, 
line 44482=>he asked the question that was troubling him most. 
line 44483=>     'Begging your pardon, Mr. Frodo,' he said, 'but have you any notion how 
line 44484=>far there is still to go?' 
line 44485=>     'No, not any clear notion, Sam, ' Frodo answered. 'In Rivendell before I 
line 44486=>set out I was shown a map of Mordor that was made before the Enemy came 
line 44487=>back 
line 44488=>here; but I only remember it  vaguely. I remember clearest  that there was a  
line 44489=>place in the north where the western  range and the  northern range send out 
line 44490=>spurs that nearly meet. That must be twenty leagues at least from the bridge  
line 44491=>back by the  Tower.  It might be  a  good point at which  to cross.  But  of 
line 44492=>course, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the Mountain, 
line 44493=>sixty miles from it,  I should think. I guess that we have gone about twelve 
line 44494=>leagues  north from the bridge now.  Even if  all goes  well, I could hardly 
line 44495=>reach  the Mountain in  a week. I am afraid, Sam, that the  burden  will get 
line 44496=>very heavy, and I shall go still slower as we get nearer.' 
line 44497=>     Sam  sighed. 'That's just as I feared,' he said. 'Well,  to say nothing 
line 44498=>of water, we've got to eat less, Mr.  Frodo,  or else move a bit quicker, at 
line 44499=>any rate while we're still in this valley. One more bite  and all the food's 
line 44500=>ended, save the Elves' waybread.' 
line 44501=>     'I'll try  and be  a  bit  quicker, Sam,'  said  Frodo,  drawing a deep 
line 44502=>breath. 'Come on then! Let's start another march!' 
line 44503=>     It was not yet quite dark again. They plodded along, on into the night. 
line 44504=>The hours passed in  a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts. At the 
line 44505=>first  hint of grey light  under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid 
line 44506=>themselves again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stone. 
line 44507=>     Slowly  the  light  grew, until it  was clearer than it yet had been. A 
line 44508=>strong wind from the West was now driving the fumes of Mordor from the 
line 44509=>upper 
line 44510=>airs. Before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for  some 
line 44511=>miles  about  them.  The trough  between the  mountains  and  the Morgai had 
line 44512=>
line 44513=>####-steadily dwindled as it climbed upwards, and the inner ridge was now no more 
line 44514=>than a shelf in the steep faces of the Ephel D®ath; but to  the east it fell 
line 44515=>as  sheerly as  ever down into Gorgoroth. Ahead the water -course came  to an 
line 44516=>end in broken steps of rock; for out from the main range there sprang a high 
line 44517=>barren spur, thrusting  eastward like a wall. To meet it there stretched out 
line 44518=>from the grey and misty  northern  range  of Ered Lithui a long jutting arm; 
line 44519=>and between the ends there  was a narrow gap: Carach Angren, the Isenmouthe, 
line 44520=>beyond  which lay the deep  dale of Udyn.  In that dale  behind the Morannon 
line 44521=>were the tunnels and deep armouries that the servants of Mordor had made for  
line 44522=>the defence of the Black Gate of their  land; and there now  their  Lord was 
line 44523=>gathering in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the 
line 44524=>West. Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and watch-fires 
line 44525=>burned;  and all  across  the gap an earth-wall had been  raised, and a deep 
line 44526=>trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridge. 
line 44527=>     A few miles north, high up in the angle where the western spur branched 
line 44528=>away from the main range, stood the old castle  of Durthang, now one of  the 
line 44529=>many orc-holds  that  clustered about  the dale of  Udyn.  A  road,  already 
line 44530=>visible in the growing light, came winding  down from it, until only a  mile 
line 44531=>or two from where the hobbits  lay it turned east and ran along a  shelf cut 
line 44532=>in the side of the  spur, and so went  down  into the plain,  and  on to the 
line 44533=>Isenmouthe. 
line 44534=>     To  the hobbits as  they  looked  out it seemed that all their  journey 
line 44535=>north had been useless. The plain to their right was dim and smoky, and they 
line 44536=>could  see  there  neither camps nor troops moving; but all  that region was 
line 44537=>under the vigilance of the for ts of Carach Angren. 
line 44538=>     'We have  come to a dead end, Sam,'  said Frodo. 'If we go on, we shall 
line 44539=>only come up to that orc-tower, but the only  road to take is that road that 
line 44540=>comes down from it - unless we go back. We can't climb up westward, or climb 
line 44541=>down eastward.' 
line 44542=>     'Then we must take the road, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam. 'We must take it and 
line 44543=>chance our luck,  if there is  any  luck in  Mordor. We  might as  well give 
line 44544=>ourselves up as wander  about any more,  or try  to go back. Our  food won't  
line 44545=>last. We've got to make a dash for it!' 
line 44546=>     'All right, Sam,' said Frodo. 'Lead me! As long as  you've got any hope 
line 44547=>left. Mine is gone. But I can't dash, Sam. I'll just plod along after you.' 
line 44548=>     'Before  you start  any more  plodding,  you need  sleep and food,  Mr. 
line 44549=>Frodo. Come and take what you can get of them!' 
line 44550=>
line 44551=>####-     He gave  Frodo  water  and an additional wafer of the  waybread, and he 
line 44552=>made  a pillow of his cloak for his master's  head. Frodo  was too  weary to 
line 44553=>debate the matter, and Sam did not tell  him that he had drunk the last drop 
line 44554=>of  their water, and eaten Sam's share of the food as well as  his own. When 
line 44555=>Frodo was asleep Sam bent over him and listened to his breathing and scanned 
line 44556=>his  face. It  was  lined and thin, and yet in  sleep it looked  content and 
line 44557=>unafraid. 'Well, here goes, Master!' Sam muttered  to himself. 'I'll have to 
line 44558=>leave you for a bit  and trust to luck. Water we must have, or we'll  get no 
line 44559=>further.' 
line 44560=>     Sam  crept  out,  and flitting  from  stone to  stone  with  more  than 
line 44561=>hobbit-care, he went down to the water -course, and then followed it for some 
line 44562=>way as it climbed  north, until he came to the rock -steps where long ago, no  
line 44563=>doubt,  its spring had come gushing  down  in  a little  waterfall. All  now 
line 44564=>seemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair Sam stooped and listened, and 
line 44565=>to his  delight he caught the sound of  trickling. Clambering a few steps up 
line 44566=>he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out  from the  hill -side  and 
line 44567=>filled a  little bare pool,  from which again it spilled, and vanished  then 
line 44568=>under the barren stones. 
line 44569=>     Sam tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then  he drank deeply,  
line 44570=>refilled the  bottle,  and turned  to go back.  At that  moment he caught  a  
line 44571=>glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near Frodo's 
line 44572=>hiding-place.  Biting  back  a cry, he leapt  down from the spring and  ran, 
line 44573=>jumping from stone to stone. It was  a  wary creature, difficult to see, but 
line 44574=>Sam had little doubt about it: he longed to get  his hands on its  neck. But 
line 44575=>it heard him coming and  slipped quickly away.  Sam  thought he  saw a  last  
line 44576=>fleeting  glimpse  of  it,  peering  back  over  the  edge  of the  eastward 
line 44577=>precipice, before it ducked and disappeared. 
line 44578=>     'Well, luck did not let me  down,' muttered Sam,  'but that was a  near 
line 44579=>thing! Isn't it enough  to have orcs by the  thousand  without that stinking 
line 44580=>villain coming nosing round? I wish he had been  shot!' He sat down by Frodo 
line 44581=>and did not rouse him; but he did not dare to  go to  sleep himself. At last  
line 44582=>when he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could 
line 44583=>not go on much longer, he wakened Frodo gently. 
line 44584=>     'That  Gollum's  about   again,  I'm  afraid,  Mr.  Frodo,'   he  said. 
line 44585=>'Leastways, if  it wasn't  him, then there's two of him. I went away to find 
line 44586=>some water and  spied  him nosing  round just as I  turned back. I reckon it 
line 44587=>isn't safe  for us  both to sleep  together,  and begging your pardon, but I 
line 44588=>
line 44589=>####-can't hold up my lids much longer.' 
line 44590=>     'Bless you, Sam!' said Frodo. 'Lie down  and take your pr oper turn! But 
line 44591=>I'd rather have Gollum than orcs. At any rate he  won't give us away to them 
line 44592=>- not unless he's caught himself.' 
line 44593=>     'But he might do a bit of robbery and murder on  his own,' growled Sam.  
line 44594=>'Keep your eyes open,  Mr. Frodo! There's  a bottle full of water. Drink up. 
line 44595=>We can fill it again when we go on.' With that Sam plunged into sleep. 
line 44596=>     Light was fading when  he  woke.  Frodo sat  propped  against  the rock  
line 44597=>behind, but he  had fallen asleep. The water-bottle  was empty. There was no 
line 44598=>sign of Gollum. 
line 44599=>     Mordor -dark  had returned, and the watch-fires on  the  heights  burned 
line 44600=>fierce and red, when the hobbits  set out  again on the most dangerous stage 
line 44601=>of all  their  journey.  They  went first  to  the  little  spring, and then 
line 44602=>climbing warily up they  came to the road at the  point  where it swung east  
line 44603=>towards  the Isenmouthe  twenty miles away. It was not a broad road, and  it  
line 44604=>had  no wall  or parapet along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from 
line 44605=>its brink became deeper and deeper. The hobbits could hear no movements, and 
line 44606=>after listening for a while they set off eastward at a steady pace. 
line 44607=>     After doing some twelve miles, they halted. A short  way back the  road 
line 44608=>had  bent a  little northward and  the stretch that they had passed over was 
line 44609=>now screened  from  sight.  This proved  disastrous. They  rested  for  some 
line 44610=>minutes and then went on; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in 
line 44611=>the stillness of  the  night they  heard the  sound that all along  they had 
line 44612=>secretly dreaded: the   noise of marching feet. It was still some way  behind 
line 44613=>them, but looking  back they could see  the twinkle of torches  coming round 
line 44614=>the  bend less  than  a mile away,  and they  were moving fast: too fast for  
line 44615=>Frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead. 
line 44616=>     'I feared  it, Sam,' said Frodo. 'We've  trusted to luck,  and  it  has 
line 44617=>failed  us.  We're trapped.' He looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where 
line 44618=>the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their  
line 44619=>heads. He ran to the other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of 
line 44620=>gloom.  'We're trapped at last!' he said He sank to the  ground beneath  the 
line 44621=>wall of rock and bowed his head. 
line 44622=>     'Seems so,' said Sam. 'Well, we can but wait and see.' And with that he 
line 44623=>sat down beside Frodo under the shadow of the cliff. 
line 44624=>     They did  not have  to wait long. The orcs were going at a  great pace. 
line 44625=>Those in the foremost files  bore torches.  On they  came, red flames in the 
line 44626=>
line 44627=>####-dark, swiftly growing. Now Sam too bowed his head, hoping that it  would hide 
line 44628=>his face when the  torches reached  them; and he  set  their  shields before 
line 44629=>their knees to hide their feet. 
line 44630=>     'If only  they  are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired  soldiers 
line 44631=>alone and pass on!' he thought. 
line 44632=>     And so it  seemed that they would. The leading  orcs came loping along, 
line 44633=>panting, holding their  heads down. They  were  a gang of the smaller breeds 
line 44634=>being driven unwilling to their Dark Lord's wars; all they cared for  was to 
line 44635=>get the march over and escape the whip. Beside them, running up and down the 
line 44636=>line, went two of the large fierce uruks, cracking lashes and shouting. File 
line 44637=>after file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was  already some way ahead. 
line 44638=>Sam held his  breath. Now more than half the line had gone by. Then suddenly 
line 44639=>one of the slave-drivers spied the two figures  by the road-side. He flicked 
line 44640=>a whip at them and yelled:  'Hi, you! Get up!' They did not answer, and with 
line 44641=>a shout he halted the whole company. 
line 44642=>     'Come on, you slugs!' he cried.  'This is  no time  for  sl ouching.' He 
line 44643=>took a step towards them, and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on 
line 44644=>their shields.  'Deserting,  eh?'  he snarled.  'Or thinking of it? All your 
line 44645=>folk  should  have been inside Udyn before yesterday evening. You know that. 
line 44646=>Up you get and fall in, or I'll have your numbers and report you.' 
line 44647=>     They  struggled to their  feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore 
line 44648=>soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear  of  the line. 'No, not at the 
line 44649=>rear!' the slave-driver shouted.  'Three files up. And stay there, or you'll 
line 44650=>know it,  when I come down the line!' He sent his  long  whip-lash  cracking  
line 44651=>over their heads; then with another crack  and a yell he started the company 
line 44652=>off again at a brisk trot. 
line 44653=>     It was hard enough for poor Sam, tired a s he was;  but for Frodo it was 
line 44654=>a torment, and soon a nightmare. He set his teeth and tried to stop his mind 
line 44655=>from  thinking, and he struggled  on. The stench of the sweating  orcs about 
line 44656=>him was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. On, on they went, and he 
line 44657=>bent  all  his will to draw his breath and to make  his legs keep going; and 
line 44658=>yet to  what evil end  he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. There 
line 44659=>was no hope of falling out  unseen: Now and  again the orc-driver fell  back  
line 44660=>and jeered at them. 
line 44661=>     'There now!' he laughed, flicking at their  legs. 'Where there's a whip 
line 44662=>there's a  will, my slugs. Hold up! I'd give you a nice freshener  now, only 
line 44663=>you'll get  as much lash as your skins will  carry when you come in late  to 
line 44664=>
line 44665=>####-your camp. Do you good. Don't you know we're at war?' 
line 44666=>     They had gone some miles, and the road was at  last running down a long  
line 44667=>slope into the plain, when  Frodo's  strength began to give out and his will 
line 44668=>wavered. He lurched and stumbled. Desperately Sam tried to help him and hold 
line 44669=>him up,  though  he felt  that he could  himself hardly  stay  the pace much 
line 44670=>longer.  At any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master 
line 44671=>would 
line 44672=>faint or fall, and  all would be discovered, and  their bitter efforts be in 
line 44673=>vain.  'I'll have that big slave-driving devil anyway,' he thought. 
line 44674=>     Then just as  he  was putting his hand  to the hilt of his sword, there 
line 44675=>came an unexpected relief.  They were out on the plain now and drawing  near 
line 44676=>the entrance to Udyn. Some  way in  front  of it,  before  the  gate  at the 
line 44677=>bridge-end, the  road  from the  west converged with others coming from  the 
line 44678=>south, and from Barad-dyr.  Along all the roads troops were moving; for  the  
line 44679=>Captains  of  the  West  were  advancing  and the Dark Lord was speeding his 
line 44680=>forces  north.  So it  chanced that  several companies came together at  the 
line 44681=>road-meeting, in the dark beyond the light of  the watch-fires on the  wall. 
line 44682=>At once there was great  jostling  and  cursing as  each troop  tried to get 
line 44683=>first to the gate and the ending of  their march.  Though the drivers yelled 
line 44684=>and plied  their whips, scuffles broke out and  some blades  were  drawn.  A 
line 44685=>troop of heavy-armed uruks from Barad-dyr charged into the Durthang line and 
line 44686=>threw them into confusion. 
line 44687=>     Dazed as he  was with  pain and weariness, Sam woke up, grasped quickly 
line 44688=>at his chance, and  threw  himself to the  ground, dragging Frodo down  with  
line 44689=>him. Orcs fell over them, snarling and  cursing. Slowly on hand and knee the 
line 44690=>hobbits  crawled  away  out of  the  turmoil, until  at last unnoticed  they 
line 44691=>dropped  over the  further edge of the road. It  had a  high kerb  by  which 
line 44692=>troop-leaders could  guide  themselves  in black night or  fog,  and it  was 
line 44693=>banked up some feet above the level of the open land. 
line 44694=>     They  lay still   for a while.  It  was too dark to  seek  for cover, if 
line 44695=>indeed there was any to  find; but Sam felt that  they ought at least to get 
line 44696=>further away from the highways and out of the range of torch-light. 
line 44697=>     'Come on, Mr. Frodo!' he whispered.  'One more  crawl, and then you can 
line 44698=>lie still.' 
line 44699=>     With a last despairing effort Frodo  raised  himself on  his hands, and 
line 44700=>struggled on for maybe twenty yards. Then he pitched down into a shallow pit 
line 44701=>that opened unexpectedly before them, and there he lay like a dead thing. 
line 44702=>
line 44703=>####- 
line 44704=> 
line 44705=>
line 44706=>Chapter 3. Mount Doom 
line 44707=>
line 44708=> 
line 44709=> 
line 44710=>     Sam put his ragged orc-cloak under  his master's head, and covered them 
line 44711=>both with the grey robe of Lurien; and as he did so his thoughts went out to 
line 44712=>that fair land, and to the Elves, and he hoped that the cloth woven by their 
line 44713=>hands  might  have some virtue to keep them  hidden beyond all hope  in this 
line 44714=>wilderness of fear. He heard the  scuffling and cries die down as the troops 
line 44715=>passed  on through the Isenmouthe. It seemed that in the confusion  and  the 
line 44716=>mingling of many  companies of various  kinds  they had not been missed, not 
line 44717=>yet at any rate. 
line 44718=>     Sam  took a sip of water, but pressed Frodo  to  drink,  and  when  his 
line 44719=>master had recovered a little he gave  him a whole  wafer of their  precious 
line 44720=>waybread and made  him  ea t it. Then, too worn out even to  feel  much fear,  
line 44721=>they stretched themselves out. They slept a little in uneasy fits; for their 
line 44722=>sweat grew chill on  them, and the  hard stones bit them, and they shivered. 
line 44723=>Out of  the north from the  Black Gate  through  Cirith  Gorgor there flowed 
line 44724=>whispering along the ground a thin cold air. 
line 44725=>     In the morning a  grey light came again, for  in  the high regions  the 
line 44726=>West Wind  still blew, but down on the stones behind the fences of the Black 
line 44727=>Land the air seemed almost dead, chill  and yet stifling. Sam looked  up out 
line 44728=>of the hollow.  The land  all about was  dreary, flat  and drab-hued. On the 
line 44729=>roads nearby nothing was moving now; but Sam feared the watchful eyes on 
line 44730=>the 
line 44731=>wall  of  the  Isenmouthe,  no  more   than   a   furlong   away  northward. 
line 44732=>South-eastward, far off like a  dark standing shadow. loomed  the  Mountain. 
line 44733=>Smokes  were  pouring from  it and while those that rose into  the upper air 
line 44734=>trailed away  eastward, great rolling clouds  floated  down  its  sides  and 
line 44735=>spread over the land. A  few miles to the north-east the  foothills  of  the 
line 44736=>Ashen  Mountains stood  like  sombre grey  ghosts, behind  which  the  misty 
line 44737=>northern heights rose  like  a line of distant cloud hardly darker than  the 
line 44738=>lowering sky. 
line 44739=>     Sam  tried to  guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to 
line 44740=>take.  It looks every step  of fifty miles,' he muttered gloomily staring at 
line 44741=>the threatening mountain, 'and that'll take a week, if it takes  a day, with 
line 44742=>Mr. Frodo as he is.' He shook his  head,  and as he worked things out, slowly  
line 44743=>
line 44744=>####-a new dark thought  grew in his mind. Never  for long had  hope died in  his 
line 44745=>staunch  heart, and  always until now he  had  taken some thought  for their 
line 44746=>return.  But the  bitter  truth  came  home to him  at  last:  at best their 
line 44747=>provision  would take them to  their goal; and when the task was done, there 
line 44748=>they would come to  an end,  alone, houseless, foodless  in  the midst  of a  
line 44749=>terrible desert. There could be no return. 
line 44750=>     'So that was the job I felt I had to  do when  I started,' thought Sam: 
line 44751=>'to help  Mr. Frodo to the last step and then die with him? Well, if that is 
line 44752=>the job then I must do it. But I would dearly like to see Bywater again, and 
line 44753=>Rosie Cotton and her brothers, and the Gaffer and Marigold  and all. I can't 
line 44754=>think somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand if there 
line 44755=>hadn't a' been  any hope  of his  ever coming back at all. Things  all  went 
line 44756=>wrong when  he went  down  in Moria.  I  wish he hadn't. He  would have done 
line 44757=>something.' 
line 44758=>     But even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to  die, it was turned to a new 
line 44759=>strength. Sam's  plain  hobbit-face  grew stern,  almost  grim, as  the will 
line 44760=>hardened in him, and he felt through  all his  limbs a thrill,  as if he was 
line 44761=>turning into  some  creature  of   stone  and steel  that neither despair nor  
line 44762=>weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue. 
line 44763=>     With  a new sense of responsibility he  brought  his  eyes  back to the 
line 44764=>ground  near at hand, studying the  next move. As the light grew a little he 
line 44765=>saw  to  his  surprise  that  what  from  a  distance  had  seemed  wide and 
line 44766=>featureless  flats  were in fact  all broken  and tumbled. Indeed the  whole 
line 44767=>surface of the plains of Gorgoroth was pocked with great holes, as if, while 
line 44768=>it was still a waste of soft mud,  it had been smitten with a shower of bolts 
line 44769=>and huge slingstones. The largest of these holes  were rimmed with ridges of 
line 44770=>broken  rock, and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions. It was 
line 44771=>a land in which it would be possible to  creep from hiding to hiding, unseen 
line 44772=>by all but the most watchful eyes: possible at least for one  who was strong 
line 44773=>and had no need for speed. For the hungry and worn, who had far to go before 
line 44774=>life failed, it had an evil look. 
line 44775=>     Thinking  of all  these things Sam went back to his  master.  He had no 
line 44776=>need to rouse  him.  Frodo was lying on his  back with eyes open, staring at 
line 44777=>the  cloudy sky. 'Well, Mr. Frodo,' said Sam, 'I've been having a look round 
line 44778=>and thinking a bit. There's  nothing on the roads, and we'd best  be getting 
line 44779=>away while there's a chance. Can you manage it?' 
line 44780=>     'I can manage it,' said Frodo. 'I must.' 
line 44781=>
line 44782=>####-     Once more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting behind 
line 44783=>such  cover  as they could find,  but moving always in  a slant towards  the 
line 44784=>foothills of the northern  range. But as they went the  most easterly of the 
line 44785=>roads followed them, until it ran  off, hugging the skirts of the mountains, 
line 44786=>away into a wall of black shadow far ahead. Neither  man  nor orc now  moved 
line 44787=>along its flat grey stretches; for the Dark Lord  had almost  completed  the 
line 44788=>movement of his forces, and even in the  fastness of his own realm he sought 
line 44789=>the secrecy of night, fearing the winds of the world that had turned against 
line 44790=>him, tearing aside his veils, and troubled with  tidings of  bold spies that 
line 44791=>had passed through his fences. 
line 44792=>     The hobbits had  gone a few weary  miles when they halted. Frodo seemed 
line 44793=>nearly  spent. Sam saw that he could not  go much further in  this  fashion, 
line 44794=>crawling, stooping, now picking  a doubtful way very slowly, now hurrying at 
line 44795=>a stumbling run. 
line 44796=>     'I'm  going  back on to the road while the light lasts, Mr.  Frodo,' he 
line 44797=>said. 'Trust to  luck again! It nearly failed us  last time,  but  it didn't 
line 44798=>quite. A steady pace for a few more miles, and then a rest.' 
line 44799=>     He was taking a far greater risk  than he knew; but  Frodo was too much 
line 44800=>occupied  with his burden and with the  struggle in  his mind to debate, and 
line 44801=>almost too hopeless  to care. They climbed  on to the  causeway and  trudged 
line 44802=>along, down the hard cruel road that led to the Dark Tower itself. But their 
line 44803=>luck held, and for the rest of that day they  met no living or moving thing; 
line 44804=>and when night fell they vanished into the darkness of Mordor. All  the land 
line 44805=>now brooded as at the coming of a  great storm: for the Captains of the West  
line 44806=>had passed  the Cross-roads and  set  flames  in  the deadly fields of Imlad 
line 44807=>Morgul. 
line 44808=>     So  the  desperate  journey  went  on, as the Ring went  south and  the 
line 44809=>banners of the  kings rode  north. For the hobbits each day,  each mile. was 
line 44810=>more  bitter than the one before, as  their  strength lessened and  the land 
line 44811=>became more  evil.  They met no enemies by day. At times  by night,  as they 
line 44812=>cowered or drowsed uneasily in some hiding beside the road, they heard cries 
line 44813=>and the  noise  of  many  feet or the swift passing of some  cruelly  ridden 
line 44814=>steed. But far  worse than all  such  perils was the ever -approaching threat 
line 44815=>that  beat  upon them as they went: the  dreadful menace of  the  Power that 
line 44816=>waited, brooding in  deep thought and sleepless malice behind  the dark veil  
line 44817=>about  its  Throne.  Nearer  and nearer it drew,  looming blacker, like  the 
line 44818=>oncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world. 
line 44819=>
line 44820=>####-     There  came at  last a dreadful nightfall; and even  as the Captains of 
line 44821=>the West drew near to the end of the living lands, the two wanderers came to  
line 44822=>an  hour of blank despair. Four days had passed since they had  escaped from 
line 44823=>the orcs,  but the  time lay behind  them like an ever -darkening  dream. All 
line 44824=>this  last  day Frodo  had not  spoken,  but had  walked  half-bowed,  often 
line 44825=>stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet. Sam guessed 
line 44826=>that  among  all their  pains he  bore the worst, the growing weight  of the 
line 44827=>Ring, a  burden on  the  body and a torment  to his  mind. Anxiously Sam had 
line 44828=>noted  how his master's left hand would often be raised  as if to ward  on a  
line 44829=>blow,  or to  screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful  Eye that sought  to 
line 44830=>look  in them.  And sometimes  his right  hand  would creep  to  his breast, 
line 44831=>clutching, and  then  slowly,  as  the will recovered mastery, it  would  be 
line 44832=>withdrawn. 
line 44833=>     Now as the blackness of night  returned Frodo sat, his head between his 
line 44834=>knees, his arms  hanging wearily  to the ground where  his hands lay  feebly  
line 44835=>twitching. Sam watched him, till  night covered them both and hid them  from 
line 44836=>one another. He could no longer find any words to say;  and he turned to his 
line 44837=>own dark thoughts. As for himself, though weary and under a  shadow of fear, 
line 44838=>he still  had some strength left. The lembas had a virtue without which they 
line 44839=>would  long  ago have  lain down to die. It did  not satisfy desire, and  at 
line 44840=>times Sam's mind  was filled with the memories of food, and the  longing for 
line 44841=>simple  bread  and meats.  And yet this waybread of the  Elves had a potency 
line 44842=>that increased as travellers  relied on it alone and did  not mingle it with 
line 44843=>other foods. It fed the will, and  it gave strength to endure, and to master  
line 44844=>sinew  and limb beyond the measure of mortal  kind. But  now a  new decision 
line 44845=>must be  made. They could not follow  this road any  longer; for  it went on 
line 44846=>eastward  into  the  great Shadow, but the Mountain  now  loomed  upon their 
line 44847=>right, almost due south, and they must turn towards it. Yet  still before it 
line 44848=>there stretched a wide region of fuming, barren, ash-ridden land. 
line 44849=>     'Water, water!'  muttered  Sam.  He had  stinted  himself,  and in  his 
line 44850=>parched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his care they  
line 44851=>now  had  very little left, perhaps half  his bottle, and  maybe there  were 
line 44852=>still days to go.  All would long ago have been spent, if they had not dared 
line 44853=>to follow the  orc-road. For at long intervals on that highway  cisterns had 
line 44854=>been built  for  the use  of troops  sent in  haste  through  the  waterless 
line 44855=>regions. In one  Sam had found some water left, stale, muddied by  the orcs,  
line 44856=>but still sufficient  for their desperate case. Yet that was now a  day ago. 
line 44857=>
line 44858=>####-There was no hope of any more. 
line 44859=>     At last  wearied with his cares Sam drowsed, leaving the morrow till it 
line 44860=>came; he could do no more. Dream and waking mingled uneasily. He saw  
line 44861=>lights 
line 44862=>like gloating yes, and dark creeping shapes, and he heard noises as of  wild 
line 44863=>beasts  or  the dreadful cries of tortured things; and he would start  up to 
line 44864=>find the world all dark and only  empty b lackness all about him. Once  only,  
line 44865=>as he stood and stared wildly round,  did it seem that, though now awake, he 
line 44866=>could still see pale lights like eyes; but soon they flickered and vanished. 
line 44867=>     The hateful night  passed  slowly  and  reluctantly. Such  da ylight  as 
line 44868=>followed was dim; for here as the Mountain drew near the air was ever mirky, 
line 44869=>while  out  from the Dark Tower  there crept the veils of Shadow that Sauron 
line 44870=>wove about himself. Frodo was lying on his back not moving. Sam stood 
line 44871=>beside 
line 44872=>him, reluctant  to speak, and yet knowing that the word now lay with him:  he 
line 44873=>must set his  master's will to work for another effort. At  length, stooping 
line 44874=>and caressing Frodo's brow, he spoke in his ear. 
line 44875=>     'Wake up, Master!' he said. 'Time for another start.' 
line 44876=>     As   if roused by a sudden  bell,  Frodo rose quickly,  and stood up and 
line 44877=>looked away southwards; but when his eyes beheld the Mountain and the desert 
line 44878=>he quailed again. 
line 44879=>     'I can't manage it, Sam,' he said. 'It is such a weight to carry,  such 
line 44880=>a weight.' 
line 44881=>     Sam knew before he spoke, that  it was vain, and that  such words might 
line 44882=>do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not  keep silent. 'Then let 
line 44883=>me carry it a bit  for you, Master,' he said. 'You know I would, and gladly, 
line 44884=>as long as I have any strength. ' 
line 44885=>     A wild light came  into Frodo's  eyes. 'Stand away! Don't touch me!' he 
line 44886=>cried. 'It is mine,  I say. Be off!' His hand strayed to his sword-hilt. But 
line 44887=>then quickly his voice changed.  'No, no,  Sam,' he said sadly.  'But you must  
line 44888=>understand. It is my   burden,  and no  one  else can bear it. It is too late 
line 44889=>now, Sam dear. You can't help me in that way again. I am almost in its power  
line 44890=>now. I could not give it up, and if you tried to take it I should go mad.' 
line 44891=>     Sam  nodded. 'I understand,'  he  said.  'But  I've been thinking,  Mr. 
line 44892=>Frodo, there's other things we might do without. Why not lighten  the load a  
line 44893=>bit? We're going that way now, as straight as we can make it.' He pointed to  
line 44894=>the Mountain. 'It's no good taking anything we're not sure to need.' 
line 44895=>
line 44896=>####-     Frodo looked again towards the Mountain. 'No,' he said, 'we shan't need 
line 44897=>much on that road.  And  at its  end  nothing.' Picking up his orc-shield he 
line 44898=>flung it away and threw his helmet after it. Then pulling off the grey cloak 
line 44899=>he undid  the  heavy  belt and let it fall to the ground,  and  the sheathed 
line 44900=>sword with it. The shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered. 
line 44901=>     'There, I'll be  an orc  no more,' he  cried, 'and  I'll bear no weapon 
line 44902=>fair or foul. Let them take me, if they will!' 
line 44903=>     Sam did likewise, and put aside his  orc-gear; and he took  out all the 
line 44904=>things  in  his pack.  Somehow  each of them had become dear to him, if only 
line 44905=>because he had borne them so far with so much toil. Hardest of all it was to 
line 44906=>part with  his cooking-gear.  Tears welled in  his eyes  at  the thought  of 
line 44907=>casting it away. 
line 44908=>     'Do you  remember that  bit  of  rabbit, Mr. Frodo?' he  said. 'And our 
line 44909=>place under the warm bank in  Captain  Faramir's  country, the  day I saw an 
line 44910=>oliphaunt?' 
line 44911=>     'No, I  am afraid not,  Sam, '  said Frodo. 'At  least, I know that such 
line 44912=>things happened,  but I cannot see them. No taste of food, no feel of water, 
line 44913=>no sound of wind,  no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or  
line 44914=>star  are left to me. I am  naked in  the  dark.  Sam, and there is  no veil 
line 44915=>between me  and  the wheel  of fire. I begin to see  it even  with my waking 
line 44916=>eyes, and all else fades.' 
line 44917=>     Sam went  to him and kissed his hand. 'Then the sooner we're rid of it, 
line 44918=>the sooner  to rest,'  he said  haltingly, finding no  better  words to say. 
line 44919=>'Talking won't mend nothing,' he muttered to himself,  as he gathered up all 
line 44920=>the  things  that they had chosen to cast away. He was  not willing to leave 
line 44921=>them lying open in the wilderness  for any eyes  to see. 'Stinker picked  up 
line 44922=>that  orc-shirt,  seemingly,  and he  isn't going to add a sword  to it. His 
line 44923=>hands are bad enough when  empty. And he isn't going to mess  with my pans!' 
line 44924=>With  that he carried all  the gear away to  one of the many gaping fissures 
line 44925=>that scored  the land and thr ew them in. The clatter of his precious pans as 
line 44926=>they fell down into the dark was like a death-knell to his heart. 
line 44927=>     He came back to Frodo, and then of his elven -rope he  cut a short piece 
line 44928=>to  serve his master  as a girdle and bind  the grey cloak close  about  his 
line 44929=>waist. The rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack. Beside that he 
line 44930=>kept  only the remnants of  their waybread  and the  water -bottle, and Sting 
line 44931=>still hanging by his belt; and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his 
line 44932=>breast the ph ial of Galadriel and the  little box that  she gave him for his 
line 44933=>
line 44934=>####-own. 
line 44935=>     Now  at  last  they turned  their faces to  the Mountain  and  set out, 
line 44936=>thinking no more of concealment,  bending  their weariness and failing wills 
line 44937=>only  to the  one task of going on. In  the dimness  of  its dreary day  few 
line 44938=>things even  in  that land  of  vigilance could have espied them, save  from 
line 44939=>close  at hand. Of all the slaves of  the  Dark  Lord, only the Nazgyl could 
line 44940=>have warned him of the  peril  that crept, small  but  indomitable, into the 
line 44941=>very  heart of his  guarded realm. But the Nazgyl and their black wings were 
line 44942=>abroad on another errand: they  were  gathered far away, shadowing the march 
line 44943=>of  the Captains of the West, and thither the  thought of the Dark Tower was 
line 44944=>turned . 
line 44945=>     That day it seemed to Sam that his master  had found some new strength,  
line 44946=>more than could be explained by the small lightening of the load that he had 
line 44947=>to carry.  In  the first marches they  went  further and faster than he  had 
line 44948=>hoped. The land was rough  and hostile, and yet they made much progress, and 
line 44949=>ever the Mountain drew nearer.  But as the  day wore on and all too soon the  
line 44950=>dim light began to fail,  Frodo stooped again, and  began to stagger, as  if 
line 44951=>the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength. 
line 44952=>     At  their last halt he sank down and said: 'I'm thirsty,  Sam,' and did 
line 44953=>not speak  again. Sam gave him  a mouthful  of water; only one more mouthful 
line 44954=>remained. He went without himself; and now as once more the  night of 
line 44955=>Mordor  
line 44956=>closed over  them, through all his thoughts there came  the memory of water; 
line 44957=>and every brook  or  stream or fount  that he  had  ever  seen, under  green 
line 44958=>willow-shades or twinkling in  the sun, danced  and rippled for his  torment 
line 44959=>behind the blindness of his eyes. He felt the cool mud about his toes  as he 
line 44960=>paddled in the Pool at Bywater with Jolly Cotton and Tom and Nibs, and their 
line 44961=>sister  Rosie. 'But that was years  ago,'  he sighed, 'and far away. The way 
line 44962=>back, if there is one, goes past the Mountain.' 
line 44963=>     He could not sleep and he held a  debate with himself. 'Well, come now,  
line 44964=>we've done better than you hoped,' he said sturdily.  'Began  well anyway. I 
line 44965=>reckon we  crossed half the distance before we stopped. One more day will do 
line 44966=>it.' And then he paused. 
line 44967=>     'Don't  be a  fool, Sam Gamgee,' came  an answer  in  his own voice. 'He 
line 44968=>won't go another day like that, if he moves at all. And you can't go on much  
line 44969=>longer giving him all the water and most of the food.' 
line 44970=>     'I can go on a good way though, and I will.' 
line 44971=>
line 44972=>####-     'Where to? ' 
line 44973=>     'To the Mountain, of course.' 
line 44974=>     'But what then, Sam Gamgee, what then? When you get there, what are you  
line 44975=>going to do? He won't be able to do anything for himself.' 
line 44976=>     To his dismay Sam realized that he  had not  got an answer  to this. He 
line 44977=>had no clear idea  at all. Frodo  had not spoken much to him  of his errand, 
line 44978=>and Sam only knew vaguely that the Ring had somehow to be put into the fire. 
line 44979=>'The Cracks of  Doom,' he muttered, the old name rising  to his mind. 'Well, 
line 44980=>if Master knows how to find them, I don't.' 
line 44981=>     'There you are!' came the answer. 'It's  all quite useless.  He said so 
line 44982=>himself. You are the fool, going on hoping and  toiling. You could have lain 
line 44983=>down and gone to sleep  together days ago, if you hadn't been so dogged. But 
line 44984=>you'll die just the same, or worse. You might just as well lie down  now and 
line 44985=>give it up. You'll never get to the top anyway.' 
line 44986=>     'I'll get there, if  I leave everything but my bones behind,' said Sam. 
line 44987=>'And I'll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart. So stop 
line 44988=>arguing!' 
line 44989=>     At  that moment Sam felt a  tremor in the  ground  beneath  him, and he 
line 44990=>heard or  sensed a deep remote rumble as  of  thunder  imprisoned  under the  
line 44991=>earth. There was a brief  red flame that flickered under the clouds and died 
line 44992=>away. The Mountain too slept uneasily. 
line 44993=>     The last stage of their journey to  Orodruin came, and it was a torment 
line 44994=>greater than Sam had ever thought that he could bear. He was in pain, and so  
line 44995=>parched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food. It remained 
line 44996=>dark, not  only because of the  smokes of the Mountain: there seemed to be a  
line 44997=>storm  coming  up,  and  away  to  the  south-east there  was  a  shimmer of 
line 44998=>lightnings under the black skies. Worst of all,  the air  was full of fumes;  
line 44999=>breathing was painful and difficult, and  a dizziness  came on them, so that 
line 45000=>they staggered and often fell. And  yet their wills did not  yield, and they 
line 45001=>struggled on. 
line 45002=>     The  Mountain crept  up ever nearer, until, if they  lifted their heavy 
line 45003=>heads, it  filled all  their sight, looming vast before them: a huge mass of 
line 45004=>ash  and slag and burned stone, out  of which a  sheer -sided cone was raised 
line 45005=>into  the clouds. Before the  daylong dusk ended and true  night  came again 
line 45006=>they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet. 
line 45007=>     With a gasp  Frodo cast  himself on  the ground. Sam sat by him. To his 
line 45008=>surprise he felt tired but lighter, and his head seemed clear again. No more 
line 45009=>
line 45010=>####-debates disturbed  his mind.  He knew all the arguments of despair and would 
line 45011=>not listen to them. His wi ll was set, and only death would break it. He felt 
line 45012=>no longer either desire  or need of sleep, but  rather  of  watchfulness. He 
line 45013=>knew  that all the hazards and perils were now  drawing together to a point: 
line 45014=>the next day would  be a day of doom, the day  of final  effort or disaster, 
line 45015=>the last gasp. 
line 45016=>     But when  would it come? The night seemed endless and  timeless, minute 
line 45017=>after  minute  falling dead and adding up to  no  passing hour,  bringing no 
line 45018=>change. Sam  began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and no day 
line 45019=>would 
line 45020=>ever  reappear. At  last he  groped  for  Frodo's  hand.  It  was  cold  and 
line 45021=>trembling. His master was shivering. 
line 45022=>     'I  didn't ought  to have left  my blanket  behind,' muttered Sam;  and 
line 45023=>lying down he tried to comfort Frodo with his arms and body. Then sleep took  
line 45024=>him,  and the dim light of  the last day of  their  quest found them side by 
line 45025=>side. The wind  had fallen  the day before  as it shifted from the West, and 
line 45026=>now  it came from the North  and began  to rise; and slowly the light of the 
line 45027=>unseen Sun filtered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay. 
line 45028=>     'Now for it! Now  for the last  gasp!' said Sam as he  struggled to his 
line 45029=>feet.  He bent over Frodo, rousing  him gently.  Frodo groaned; but  with  a  
line 45030=>great effort of will he staggered up; and then he fell upon his knees again.  
line 45031=>He raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes of Mount Doom towering 
line 45032=>above him, and then pitifully he began to crawl forward on his hands.  
line 45033=>     Sam looked at him and wept in his heart, but  no tears came to his  dry 
line 45034=>and stinging eyes. 'I said I'd carry him, if it broke my back,' he muttered, 
line 45035=>'and I will!' 
line 45036=>     'Come, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I can't carry it for you, but I can carry 
line 45037=>you and  it as well.  So  up you get! Come on, Mr. Frodo dear! Sam will give 
line 45038=>you a ride. Just tell him where to go, and he'll go.' 
line 45039=>     As Frodo clung upon his back, arms loosely about his neck, legs clasped 
line 45040=>firmly under his arms, Sam staggered to his  feet; and then to his amazement  
line 45041=>he felt the  burden light. He had feared that he would  have barely strength 
line 45042=>to lift  his  master alone, and beyond that he had expected to share in  the 
line 45043=>dreadful dragging weight of the  accursed  Ring.  But it was not so. Whether  
line 45044=>because Frodo  was so worn by his  long pains, wound  of knife, and venomous 
line 45045=>sting,  and  sorrow, fear, and homeless wandering, or  because some  gift of 
line 45046=>final  strength was given to  him, Sam lifted Frodo with no more  difficulty 
line 45047=>
line 45048=>####-than if he were carrying a hobbit-child pig-a -back in some romp on the lawns 
line 45049=>or hayfields of the Shire. He took a deep breath and started off. 
line 45050=>     They had reached the Mountain's foot on its northern side, and a little 
line 45051=>to the westward; there its long grey  slopes, though broken, were not sheer. 
line 45052=>Frodo did  not speak,  and so Sam  struggled on as best he could, having  no  
line 45053=>guidance but the will to climb as high as might be  before his strength gave 
line 45054=>out  and his will broke. On he toiled, up and up, turning this way and  that 
line 45055=>to lessen  the slope, often stumbling forward, and at the last crawling like 
line 45056=>a snail  with  a  heavy burden on its back. When his will could drive him no 
line 45057=>further, and his limbs gave way, he stopped and laid his master gently down.  
line 45058=>     Frodo opened his eyes and  drew a breath.  It was easier  to breathe up 
line 45059=>here  above the reeks that coiled and drifted down below. 'Thank you,  Sam,' 
line 45060=>he said in a cracked whisper. 'How far is there to go?' 
line 45061=>     'I don't know,' said Sam, 'because I don't know where we're going.' 
line 45062=>     He looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to see how far 
line 45063=>his last effort had brought him. The Mountain standing ominous and alone had 
line 45064=>looked taller than it was. Sam saw  now that it was less lofty than the high 
line 45065=>passes of the Ephel D®ath which  he and Frodo had  scaled. The  confused and 
line 45066=>tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three thousand feet above  
line 45067=>the plain,  and above them was  reared half as  high again its  tall central 
line 45068=>cone, like a vast oast  or chimney capped with a jagged  crater. But already 
line 45069=>Sam was  more than half way up  the base, and the pla in of Gorgoroth was dim 
line 45070=>below him, wrapped in fume and shadow. As he looked up he would have 
line 45071=>given a  
line 45072=>shout. if his parched throat had allowed him; for amid the rugged humps  and 
line 45073=>shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road.  It climbed like a rising 
line 45074=>girdle from the west and wound snakelike about the Mountain, until before it 
line 45075=>went  round out of  view it reached the foot  of the  cone upon its  eastern 
line 45076=>side. 
line 45077=>     Sam could  not see  the course  immediately above  him,  where  it  was 
line 45078=>lowest, for a steep slope went up from where he stood; but  he  guessed that 
line 45079=>if he could only struggle on just a little way further up, they would strike 
line 45080=>this path. A gleam of hope returned to  him. They might conquer the Mountain 
line 45081=>yet. 'Why, it might have  been put there a -purpose!' he said to himself. 'If 
line 45082=>it wasn't there, I'd have to say I was beaten in the end.' 
line 45083=>     The path was not put there for the purposes of Sam. He did not know it, 
line 45084=>but he was looking at Sauron's Road  from Barad-dyr to the Sammath Naur, the 
line 45085=>
line 45086=>####-Chambers of Fire. Out from the Dark Tower's huge western gate it came over a  
line 45087=>deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron, and then passing  into the plain it ran 
line 45088=>for a league between  two smoking  chasms,  and so  reached  a  long sloping 
line 45089=>causeway that led up on to the Mountain's eastern side.  Thence, turning and  
line 45090=>encircling all  its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high 
line 45091=>in the upper cone, but still far from the reeking summit, to a dark entrance 
line 45092=>that  gazed back  east  straight  to  the  Window  of  the  Eye  in Sauron's 
line 45093=>shadow-mantled fortress. Often blocked  or destroyed by  the tumults  of the 
line 45094=>Mountain's furnaces, always  that road was repaired and cleaned again by the 
line 45095=>labours of countless orcs.  
line 45096=>     Sam drew a deep breath. There was a path, but how he was to get  up the 
line 45097=>slope to it he did not know. First he must ease his aching back. He lay flat 
line 45098=>beside Frodo for a  while. Neither spoke. Slowly the light  grew. Suddenly a  
line 45099=>sense of urgency which  he did not understand  came to Sam. It was almost as 
line 45100=>if he had been called: 'Now, now, or it will be too late!' He braced himself 
line 45101=>and  got up. Frodo also seemed to have felt  the  call. He struggled to  his 
line 45102=>knees. 
line 45103=>     'I'll crawl, Sam,' he gasped. 
line 45104=>     So foot by foot, like small grey insects, they crept up the sl ope. They 
line 45105=>came to the path and found  that it was broad, paved with broken rubble  and  
line 45106=>beaten  ash.  Frodo clambered on  to  it,  and  then  moved  as  if by  some 
line 45107=>compulsion he turned slowly to face  the East. Far off the shadows of Sauron 
line 45108=>hung; but  torn by some gust of wind out of the world, or else moved by some 
line 45109=>great  disquiet within,  the mantling  clouds swirled, and for a moment drew 
line 45110=>aside; and  then he saw,  rising  black,  blacker and  darker than  the vast  
line 45111=>shades  amid which it  stood,  the  cruel pinnacles  and  iron  crown of the 
line 45112=>topmost tower of Barad-dyr. One moment  only it stared out, but as from some 
line 45113=>great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward  a  flame of red, the 
line 45114=>flicker of  a piercing Eye;  and then the shadows were furled  again and the 
line 45115=>terrible vision was removed. The Eye was not  turned to them:  it was gazing 
line 45116=>north to where the Captains of  the West  stood at bay, and thither  all its 
line 45117=>malice was now bent, as the Power moved to strike its deadly blow; but Frodo 
line 45118=>at that dreadful glimpse fell as  one stricken mortally. His hand sought the 
line 45119=>chain about his neck. 
line 45120=>     Sam knelt  by him. Faint, almost  inaudibly, he heard Frodo whispering: 
line 45121=>'Help me, Sam! Help me, Sam! Hold  my hand! I can't  stop it.' Sam took  his 
line 45122=>master's hands a nd laid  them together, palm to  palm, and kissed them;  and  
line 45123=>
line 45124=>####-then he held them gently  between his own. The thought came suddenly to him: 
line 45125=>'He's spotted us! It's all  up, or it soon will be. Now, Sam Gamgee, this is 
line 45126=>the end of ends.' 
line 45127=>     Again  he  lifted Frodo  and drew  his  hands down to  his  own breast. 
line 45128=>letting his master's legs  dangle. Then he bowed his  head and struggled off 
line 45129=>along the climbing road. It was  not as easy a way to take as it had  looked 
line 45130=>at first.  By fortune the fires that had poured  forth in the great  turmoils 
line 45131=>when Sam stood upon  Cirith Ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern 
line 45132=>and 
line 45133=>western slopes,  and the road  on  this  side  was not blocked.  Yet in many 
line 45134=>places it had crumbled  away or was crossed  by gaping rents. After climbing 
line 45135=>eastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp  angle  and  went 
line 45136=>westward fox  a space. There at the bend it  was  cut deep through a crag of 
line 45137=>old weathered  stone once long  ago vomited  from the  Mountain's  furnaces. 
line 45138=>Panting under his load Sam turned the bend;  and even  as he did  so, out of 
line 45139=>the corner of his  eye, he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag, 
line 45140=>like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as he passed. 
line 45141=>     A sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward, tearing the backs  of 
line 45142=>his hands that still clasped his master's. Then  he knew what had  happened,  
line 45143=>for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice. 
line 45144=>     'Wicked masster!' it hissed. 'Wicked masster cheats us; cheats Smjagol, 
line 45145=>gollum. He musstn't go that  wa y. He  musstn't hurt  Preciouss. Give  it  to 
line 45146=>Smjagol, yess, give it to us! Give it to uss!' 
line 45147=>     With a  violent heave Sam rose up.  At once  he drew his  sword; but he 
line 45148=>could do nothing.  Gollum and Frodo were locked together. Gollum was tearing 
line 45149=>at  his master,  trying to  get at the chain and the Ring. This was probably 
line 45150=>the only thing  that could have roused the dying embers of Frodo's heart and  
line 45151=>will:  an  attack,  an attempt to wrest his  treasure from him by force.  He 
line 45152=>fought back with a sudden  fury  that  amazed Sam, and Gollum  also. Even so 
line 45153=>things  might have  gone far  otherwise,  if  Gollum  himself  had  remained 
line 45154=>unchanged;  but whatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he 
line 45155=>had trodden, driven by a devouring desire and a terrible fear, they had left  
line 45156=>grievous marks on him. He was a lean, starved, haggard thing, all  bones and 
line 45157=>tight-drawn sallow skin. A wild light flamed in his eyes, but his malice was 
line 45158=>no longer matched by his old griping strength. Frodo flung him off and  rose 
line 45159=>up quivering. 
line 45160=>     'Down,  down!' he gasped,  clutching his hand  to his  breast,  so that 
line 45161=>
line 45162=>####-beneath  the cover  of his  leather shirt  he clasped  the Ring.  'Down  you  
line 45163=>creeping  thing,  and out of  my path!  Your time is at an  end.  You cannot 
line 45164=>betray me or slay me now.' 
line 45165=>     Then  suddenly, as  before under the eaves of the  Emyn Muil,  Sam  saw 
line 45166=>these  two rivals  with other vision. A crouching shape, scarcely  more than 
line 45167=>the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet  
line 45168=>filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern,  untouchable 
line 45169=>now by pity, a figure robed  in white, but at its breast it held a  wheel of 
line 45170=>fire. Out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice. 
line 45171=>     'Begone, and trouble me no more! If you touch me ever again,  you shall  
line 45172=>be cast yourself into the Fire of Doom.' 
line 45173=>     The crouching  shape  backed away, terror in its blinking eyes, and yet 
line 45174=>at the same time insatiable desire. 
line 45175=>     Then the vision  passed and Sam saw Frodo standing, hand on breast, his 
line 45176=>breath coming in great gasps,  and Gollum at his feet, resting  on his knees 
line 45177=>with his wide-splayed hands upon the ground. 
line 45178=>     'Look  out!' cried Sam. 'He'll spring!' He stepped forward, brandishing 
line 45179=>his  sword. 'Quick, Master!' he gasped. 'Go on! Go on! No time to lose. I'll 
line 45180=>deal with him. Go on!' 
line 45181=>     Frodo looked at him as if at one now far away. 'Yes, I must  go on,' he 
line 45182=>said. 'Farewell, Sam!  This is the  end at last.  On  Mount  Doom doom shall 
line 45183=>fall. Farewell!'  He  turned and went on,  walking slowly  but  erect u p the 
line 45184=>climbing path. 
line 45185=>     'Now!' said Sam. 'At last  I can deal with you!' He leaped forward with 
line 45186=>drawn blade ready for battle. But  Gollum did not spring. He fell  flat upon 
line 45187=>the ground and whimpered. 
line 45188=>     'Don't kill us,'  he wept. 'Don't hurt us with  na ssty cruel steel! Let 
line 45189=>us live,  yes,  live just a little longer. Lost lost!  We're lost. And  when 
line 45190=>Precious goes we'll die, yes, die into the  dust.' He clawed up the ashes of 
line 45191=>the path with his long fleshless fingers.  'Dusst!' he hissed. 
line 45192=>     Sam's hand wa vered. His mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil. 
line 45193=>It would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous creature, just and many 
line 45194=>times deserved;  and also it  seemed the  only safe thing to do. But deep in 
line 45195=>his heart there was something that restrained him: he could not strike  this 
line 45196=>thing  lying  in the  dust, forlorn, ruinous,  utterly wretched. He himself, 
line 45197=>though only for a little while, had borne the Ring, and now dimly he guessed 
line 45198=>the  agony of  Gollum's  shrivelled  mind and body,  enslaved to tha t  Ring, 
line 45199=>
line 45200=>####-unable  to find peace or relief ever in  life again. But Sam had no words to 
line 45201=>express what he felt. 
line 45202=>     'Oh, curse you, you stinking thing!' he said. 'Go away! Be off! I don't  
line 45203=>trust you, not as far as I could kick you; but be off. Or I  shall hurt you, 
line 45204=>yes, with nasty cruel steel.' 
line 45205=>     Gollum got up on all fours, and backed away for several paces, and then 
line 45206=>he turned, and as  Sam aimed a kick at him  he fled away down the  path. Sam 
line 45207=>gave no  more heed  to him. He suddenly remembered his master. He looked  
line 45208=>up 
line 45209=>the  path and could not see him. As fast as he could he trudged up the road. 
line 45210=>If he had looked back, he might have seen  not  far below Gollum turn again, 
line 45211=>and then with a wild light of madness glaring in his eyes come,  swiftly but 
line 45212=>warily, creeping on behind, a slinking shadow among the stones.  
line 45213=>     The  path climbed on.  Soon  it bent again  and. with a  last  eastward 
line 45214=>course passed in a cutting along the face of the  cone  and came to the dark 
line 45215=>door in the Mountain's side, the door  of the  Samma th  Naur. Far  away  now 
line 45216=>rising  towards  the  South the  sun, piercing  the  smokes and haze, burned 
line 45217=>ominous, a dull  bleared  disc of red; but all Mordor lay about the Mountain  
line 45218=>like a dead land, silent, shadow-folded, waiting for some dreadful stroke. 
line 45219=>     Sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in. It was dark and  hot, and a  
line 45220=>deep rumbling shook the  air.  'Frodo!  Master!'  he  called. There  was  no 
line 45221=>answer. For a  moment he stood, his heart beating with wild fears,  and then  
line 45222=>he plunged in. A shadow followed him. 
line 45223=>     At first he could see nothing. In his great need he drew  out once more 
line 45224=>the phial of Galadriel, but it  was pale and cold in  his trembling hand and 
line 45225=>threw no light  into that stifling  dark. He was come  to the  heart of  the 
line 45226=>realm  of  Sauron  and  the  forges  of  his   ancient  might,  greatest  in 
line 45227=>Middle-earth;  all other powers  were here  subdued. Fearfully he took a few 
line 45228=>uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a  flash of red 
line 45229=>that leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. Then Sam saw  that he was 
line 45230=>in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the  Mountain's  smoking cone.  But 
line 45231=>only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by 
line 45232=>a great fissure, out of which the  red glare came, now leaping u p, now dying 
line 45233=>down  into  darkness; and all the while  far  below there was a rumour and a  
line 45234=>trouble as of great engines throbbing and labouring. 
line 45235=>     The light sprang up  again, and there on the brink of the chasm, at the 
line 45236=>very Crack of Doom, stood Frodo,  black against the glare, tense, erect, but 
line 45237=>
line 45238=>####-still as if he had been turned to stone. 
line 45239=>     'Master!' cried Sam. 
line 45240=>     Then Frodo stirred  and  spoke with a  clear voice, indeed with a voice 
line 45241=>clearer and more powerful than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above 
line 45242=>the throb and turmoil of Mount Doom, ringing in the roof and walls.  
line 45243=>     'I have come,' he said. 'But I  do not choose now to do what I  came to 
line 45244=>do. I will not do this  deed. The Ring is mine!' And suddenly, as he set  it 
line 45245=>on  his finger,  he  vanished  from Sam's sight.  Sam gasped,  but he had no 
line 45246=>chance to cry out, for at that moment many things happened. 
line 45247=>     Something struck Sam violently in the back,  his legs were knocked from 
line 45248=>under him and he was flung aside, striking his head against the stony  floor, 
line 45249=>as a dark shape sprang  over him. He  lay still  and for a  moment  all went 
line 45250=>black. 
line 45251=>     And far away, as Frodo put on the Ring and claimed it for his own, even 
line 45252=>in  Sammath Naur the  very heart  of his realm, the Power  in  Barad-dyr was 
line 45253=>shaken, and  the Tower trembled from its foundations to its  proud and bitter  
line 45254=>crown.  The  Dark Lord was suddenly  aware of him, and  his Eye piercing all 
line 45255=>shadows  looked  across the plain to  the door  that he had  made;  and  the 
line 45256=>magnitude of  his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash, and all 
line 45257=>the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare.  Then his wrath blazed in 
line 45258=>consuming flame, but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him. For 
line 45259=>he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon which his doom now hung. 
line 45260=>     From all his policies and  webs of  fear  and treachery, from  all  his 
line 45261=>stratagems and wars his mind shook  free; and throughout his realm  a tremor 
line 45262=>ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies  halted,  and his captains  suddenly 
line 45263=>steerless,  bereft of will, wavered and  despaired. For they were forgotten. 
line 45264=>The whole mind and purpose of the Power that wielded them was now bent  
line 45265=>with 
line 45266=>overwhelming  force  upon  the Mountain.  At his  summons,  wheeling with  a  
line 45267=>rending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the 
line 45268=>Nazgyl the Ringwraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to 
line 45269=>Mount Doom. 
line 45270=>     Sam got up. He was dazed,  and blood streaming from his head dripped in 
line 45271=>his eyes. He groped  forward, and then  he saw a strange and terrible thing. 
line 45272=>Gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen 
line 45273=>foe. To and fro he swayed, now  so near the brink that almost he tumbled in, 
line 45274=>now dragging back, falling to the ground, rising, and falling again. And all 
line 45275=>
line 45276=>####-the while he hissed but spoke no words. 
line 45277=>     The fires below  awoke in  anger,  the  red  light  blazed, and all the 
line 45278=>cavern was  filled with  a great glare  and heat. Suddenly  Sam saw Gollum's 
line 45279=>long hands  draw  upwards  to  his mouth; his white fangs gleamed,  and then 
line 45280=>snapped as  they bit. Frodo  gave a cry, and there he was, fallen  upon  his 
line 45281=>knees at the chasm's edge. But Gollum, dancing  like a mad thing, held aloft  
line 45282=>the ring, a finger still thrust within its circle. It shone now as if verily 
line 45283=>it was wrought of living fire. 
line 45284=>     'Precious,  precious,  precious!'  Gollum  cried. 'My  Precious!  O  my 
line 45285=>Precious!'  And with that, even as his eyes were lifted  up to gloat  on his 
line 45286=>prize, he  stepped  too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and 
line 45287=>then  with a shriek he fell. Out of the depths came  his last wail Precious, 
line 45288=>and he was gone. 
line 45289=>     There was a roar  and a great confusion  of noise. Fires leaped  up and 
line 45290=>licked the  roof.  The throbbing  grew to a great tumult,  and the  Mountain 
line 45291=>shook. Sam ran to Frodo and picked him up and carried him. out to the  door. 
line 45292=>And there upon the dark threshold of the Sammath Naur, high above the plains 
line 45293=>of Mordor, such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting 
line 45294=>all else, and gazed as one turned to st one. 
line 45295=>     A brief vision he had of  swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers 
line 45296=>and battlements, tall as  hills, founded upon a mighty mountain-throne above 
line 45297=>immeasurable pits;  great  courts and  dungeons, eyeless  prisons  sheer  as 
line 45298=>cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then  all passed.  Towers 
line 45299=>fell  and  mountains slid;  walls crumbled and melted,  crashing down;  vast 
line 45300=>spires  of  smoke and  spouting  steams  went  billowing  up, up, until they 
line 45301=>toppled  like  an overwhelming  wave, and  its  wild  crest  curled and came 
line 45302=>foaming down  upon the land. And then at last  over  the miles between there 
line 45303=>came a rumble, rising to a deafening  crash  and roar;  the earth shook, the 
line 45304=>plain heaved and  cracked, and Orodruin reeled. Fire belched from its   riven 
line 45305=>summit.  The  skies  burst  into  thunder seared  with lightning. Down  like 
line 45306=>lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain. And into the heart of the storm, 
line 45307=>with a cry that pierced all  other  sounds, tearing the clouds asunder,  the 
line 45308=>Nazgyl came, shooting  like  flaming bolts, as  caught in the  fiery ruin of 
line 45309=>hill and sky they crackled, withered, and went out. 
line 45310=>     'Well,  this  is the end, Sam Gamgee,'  said a  voice by his side.  And 
line 45311=>there was Frodo, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his eyes there 
line 45312=>was peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor any fear. His burden 
line 45313=>
line 45314=>####-was taken away. There was the dear master of the sweet days in the Shire. 
line 45315=>     'Master!' cried  Sam. and fell upon his knees. In all that ruin  of the 
line 45316=>world for the momen t he  felt only joy, great joy. The burden  was gone. His 
line 45317=>master had  been  saved;  he was  himself again, he was free. And  then  Sam 
line 45318=>caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand. 
line 45319=>     'Your poor hand!'  he said.  'And I have nothing to  bind it  with,  or 
line 45320=>comfort it.  I would have  spared him  a whole hand of mine rather. But he's 
line 45321=>gone now beyond recall, gone for ever.' 
line 45322=>     'Yes,'  said Frodo. 'But do  you remember Gandalf's words: Even  Gollum 
line 45323=>may  have something  yet to do? But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed 
line 45324=>the Ring. The Quest would  have been in vain, even at the bitter end. So let 
line 45325=>us forgive  him!  For the Quest  is achieved, and now all is over. I am glad 
line 45326=>you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam.' 
line 45327=>
line 45328=>####- 
line 45329=> 
line 45330=>
line 45331=>Chapter 4. The Field of Cormallen 
line 45332=>
line 45333=> 
line 45334=> 
line 45335=>     All about the hills the hosts of Mordor raged. The Captains of the West  
line 45336=>were foundering in a gathering sea. The sun gleamed red, and under the wings 
line 45337=>of the Nazgyl  the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth. Aragorn  stood 
line 45338=>beneath his  banner,  silent and stern, as one lost in thought of things long 
line 45339=>past or far away; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as 
line 45340=>the  night deepens.  Upon the hill-top stood Gandalf,  and  he was white and 
line 45341=>cold and no shadow fell on him. The onslaught of Mordor broke like a wave on 
line 45342=>the beleaguered hills,  voices roaring like a tide amid the  wreck and crash 
line 45343=>of arms.  
line 45344=>     As  if to his eyes some sudden vision had  been given, Gandalf stirred; 
line 45345=>and  he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear. Then 
line 45346=>he lifted up his hands and cried in  a loud voice ringing above the din: The 
line 45347=>Eagles are coming! And many voices answered crying:  The  Eagles are 
line 45348=>coming! 
line 45349=>The Eagles are  coming! The hosts of Mordor looked up and wondered what 
line 45350=>this 
line 45351=>sign might mean. 
line 45352=>     There came Gwaihir the Windlord, and Landroval his brother, greatest of  
line 45353=>all the Eagles of  the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor, 
line 45354=>who built his eyries in the inaccessible peaks of the  Encircling  Mountains 
line 45355=>when Middle-earth was young. Behind  them in long swift lines came all their 
line 45356=>vassals  from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathering wind. Straight 
line 45357=>down  upon the Nazgyl they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and 
line 45358=>the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale. 
line 45359=>     But the  Nazgyl  turned and  fled, and vanished into  Mordor's shadows, 
line 45360=>hearing  a sudden terrible  call  out of the  Dark Tower; and  even  at that 
line 45361=>moment  all the hosts of Mordor trembled, doubt clutched their hearts,  their 
line 45362=>laughter  failed, their hands shook  and their limbs were loosed.  The Power  
line 45363=>that drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wavering, its will  
line 45364=>was removed from them; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they 
line 45365=>saw 
line 45366=>a deadly light and were afraid. 
line 45367=>
line 45368=>####-     Then all the Captains  of  the West cried aloud, for their hearts  were 
line 45369=>filled  with a  new hope in the midst of darkness. Out  from the beleaguered 
line 45370=>hills   knights  of   Gondor,  Riders  of  Rohan,  D®nedain  of  the  North, 
line 45371=>close-serried  companies, drove against  their wavering  foes, piercing  the 
line 45372=>press with the thrust of bitter spears. But  Gandalf lifted up his arms  and 
line 45373=>called once more in a clear voice: 
line 45374=>     'Stand, Men of the West! Stand and wait! This is the hour of doom.' 
line 45375=>     And even  as he spoke  the earth rocked beneath their feet. Then rising 
line 45376=>swiftly  up,  far  above the  Towers  of  the  Black  Gate, high  above  the 
line 45377=>mountains,  a vast soaring  darkness  sprang into the sky,  flickering  with 
line 45378=>fire. The  earth  groaned  and quaked.  The  Towers  of  the  Teeth  swayed, 
line 45379=>tottered, and fell down; the mighty rampart  crumbled;  the Black  Gate  was 
line 45380=>hurled in ruin; and from far away, now dim, now growing, now mounting to 
line 45381=>the 
line 45382=>clouds, there came a drumming rumble, a roar, a long echoing roll of ruinous 
line 45383=>noise. 
line 45384=>     'The  realm of  Sauron is ended!'  said  Gandalf.  'The Ring-bearer has 
line 45385=>fulfilled his Quest.' And as the Captains gazed south to the Land of Mordor, 
line 45386=>it seemed to them that, black  against  the pall of cloud, there rose a huge 
line 45387=>shape of shadow,  impenetrable,  lightning-crowned,  filling  all  the  sky. 
line 45388=>Enormous it reared above the world,  and stretched  out towards  them a vast  
line 45389=>threatening hand, terrible but  impotent: for even as it leaned over them, a  
line 45390=>great wind took it, and  it was  all blown away, and passed; and then a hush 
line 45391=>fell. 
line 45392=>     The Captains  bowed their heads; and when they looked up again, behold! 
line 45393=>their enemies were flying and  the power of Mordor was scattering  like dust  
line 45394=>in the wind. As when death  smites the swollen brooding thing  that inhabits 
line 45395=>their crawling hill and holds them all in sway, ants will wander witless and 
line 45396=>purposeless and then feebly die, so the creatures of Sauron, orc or troll or  
line 45397=>beast  spell-enslaved,  ran  hither  and  thither  mindless;  and  some slew 
line 45398=>themselves, or  cast themselves  in pits,  or  fled wailing  back to hide in 
line 45399=>holes and dark lightless  places far  from hope. But the Men of  Rhyn and of 
line 45400=>Harad, Easterling and  Southron, saw  the ruin of their war  and  the  great 
line 45401=>majesty and glory  of the Captains of the West. And those  that were deepest  
line 45402=>and longest in evil servitude,  hating the West, and yet were men  proud and 
line 45403=>bold,  in their turn now gathered  themselves for a  last stand of desperate 
line 45404=>battle. But the most part fled eastward  as  they could; and some cast their  
line 45405=>
line 45406=>####-weapons down and sued for mercy. 
line 45407=>     Then Gandalf, leaving all such matters of battle and command to Aragorn 
line 45408=>and the  other  lords, stood  upon the hill-top  and called; and down to him 
line 45409=>came the great eagle, Gwaihir  the Windlord, and stood before him. 
line 45410=>     'Twice you have  borne me,  Gwaihir my friend,'  said  Gandalf. 'Thrice 
line 45411=>shall pay for all, if you  are willing. You will  not find  me a burden much 
line 45412=>greater than when  you bore me from  Zirak-zigil, where  my  old life burned 
line 45413=>away.' 
line 45414=>     'I would  bear you,' answered Gwaihir, 'whither you will, even were you  
line 45415=>made of stone.' 
line 45416=>     'Then  come, and let your  brother go with us,  and some other of  your 
line 45417=>folk who is most  swift! For we have need of  speed greater than  any  wind,  
line 45418=>outmatching the wings of the Nazgyl.' 
line 45419=>     'The North  Wind blows, but we  shall outfly it,' said Gwaihir. And  he 
line 45420=>lifted up Gandalf and  sped away south, and  with  him  went Landroval,  and 
line 45421=>Meneldor young and swift. And they passed over  Udyn and  Gorgoroth  and 
line 45422=>saw 
line 45423=>all  the land in  ruin and tumult  beneath them, and before them Mount  Doom 
line 45424=>blazing, pouring out its fire. 
line 45425=>     'I am glad that you are here with me,' said Frodo. 'Here at the end  of 
line 45426=>all things, Sam.' 
line 45427=>     'Yes, I  am with  you, Master,' said Sam, laying  Frodo's  wounded hand 
line 45428=>gently to his breast. 'And you're with me.  And  the journey's finished. But 
line 45429=>after  coming all that way I don't  want to give  up  yet. It's not like me, 
line 45430=>somehow, if you understand.' 
line 45431=>     'Maybe not, Sam,' said Frodo; 'but  it's like things  are in the world. 
line 45432=>Hopes fail. An end comes.  We have only  a little  time to wait  now. We are 
line 45433=>lost in ruin and downfall, and there is no escape.' 
line 45434=>     'Well,  Master, we could at  least go further from this dangerous place 
line 45435=>here, from this Crack of Doom,  if  that's its name. Now couldn't  we? Come, 
line 45436=>Mr. Frodo, let's go down the path at any rate!' 
line 45437=>     'Very  well,  Sam. If you wish to go, I'll come,' said  Frodo; and they 
line 45438=>rose and went slowly down the  winding road; and even as they passed towards 
line 45439=>the  Mountain's  quaking  feet, a  great smoke and steam  belched  from  the 
line 45440=>Sammath Naur, and the side  of  the cone was riven open,  and  a  huge fiery 
line 45441=>vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side. 
line 45442=>     Frodo and Sam could go no further. Their last strength of mind and body 
line 45443=>
line 45444=>####-was  swiftly  ebbing.  They  had  reached  a low ashen  hill  piled  at  the 
line 45445=>Mountain's foot; but from it there was no more escape. It was an island now,  
line 45446=>not long to  endure, amid the torment  of Orodruin. All about  it the  earth 
line 45447=>gaped, and from  deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up. Behind  them 
line 45448=>the Mountain was  convulsed. Great rents opened in  its side. Slow rivers of 
line 45449=>fire came down the  long slopes towards them. Soon they would be engulfed. A 
line 45450=>rain of hot ash was falling. 
line 45451=>     They stood now; and Sam still holding his master's hand caressed it. He 
line 45452=>sighed. 'What a  tale we have been in, Mr. Frodo, haven't  we?' he said.  'I  
line 45453=>wish I could hear it told! Do you think they'll say:  Now comes the story of 
line 45454=>Nine-fingered Frodo and the Ring of Doom? And then everyone  will hush, like 
line 45455=>we  did,  when  in Rivendell they told us the tale of Beren One-hand and the 
line 45456=>Great Jewel. I wish I could hear  it!  And I wonder how it will go on  after  
line 45457=>our part.' 
line 45458=>     But even while he spoke  so, to keep fear away until the very last, his 
line 45459=>eyes still strayed north,  north  into the eye of the wind, to where the sky 
line 45460=>far off was  clear,  as the cold  blast, rising to  a  gale, drove  back the 
line 45461=>darkness and the ruin of the clouds.  
line 45462=> 
line 45463=>     And so  it was that Gwaihir  saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes, as 
line 45464=>down  the  wild  wind he came,  and  daring the great peril of the skies  he 
line 45465=>circled in  the  air: two small dark figures,  forlorn, hand  in hand upon a  
line 45466=>little  hill, while the  world  shook under them, and  gasped, and rivers of 
line 45467=>fire drew near. And even as  he  espied them and came swooping down, he  
line 45468=>saw 
line 45469=>them  fall, worn out,  or  choked  with  fumes and heat, or stricken down by 
line 45470=>despair at last, hiding the ir eyes from death. 
line 45471=>     Side by side they lay; and  down swept Gwaihir, and down came Landroval 
line 45472=>and  Meneldor the swift; and in a dream, not  knowing what fate had befallen 
line 45473=>them,  the wanderers were  lifted up and borne far away  out of the darkness 
line 45474=>and the fire. 
line 45475=>     When Sam awoke, he found that he  was lying on some soft bed, but  over 
line 45476=>him  gently swayed wide  beechen boughs,  and  through  their  young  leaves 
line 45477=>sunlight glimmered, green and gold. All the  air was full of a sweet mingled  
line 45478=>scent. 
line 45479=>     He  remembered that smell: the  fragrance  of Ithilien. 'Bless  me!' he 
line 45480=>mused. 'How long have I been  asleep?' For the  scent had borne  him back to 
line 45481=>
line 45482=>####-the day when he  had  lit  his little  fire under  the sunny bank; and for a  
line 45483=>moment all else  between was out of  waking  memory. He stretched and drew 
line 45484=>a 
line 45485=>deep breath. 'Why, what a dream I've had!' he muttered. 'I am glad to wake!' 
line 45486=>He sat  up and then he  saw  that  Frodo  was  lying  beside  him, and slept 
line 45487=>peacefully,  one  hand  behind  his  head, and  the other  resting  upon the 
line 45488=>coverlet. It was the right hand, and the third finger was missing. 
line 45489=>     Full memory flooded back, and Sam cried aloud: 'It wasn't a dream! Then 
line 45490=>where are we?' 
line 45491=>     And a  voice spoke softly behind:  'In the land of Ithilien, and in the 
line 45492=>keeping of the King; and he awaits you.' With that Gandalf stood before him, 
line 45493=>robed in white, his beard now  gleaming like  pure snow in  the twinkling of 
line 45494=>the leafy sunlight. 'Well, Master Samwise, how do you feel?' he said. 
line 45495=>     But Sam lay back, and stared with open mouth, and for a moment, between 
line 45496=>bewilderment  and great  joy,  he  could  not  answer.  At  last  he gasped: 
line 45497=>'Gandalf! I thought you were dead! But then I thought I was  dead myself. Is 
line 45498=>everything sad going to come untrue? What's happened to the world?' 
line 45499=>     'A great Shadow  has departed,' said  Gandalf, and then he  laughed and 
line 45500=>the  sound was like music,  or  like  water in  a  parched land; and  as  he 
line 45501=>listened  the thought came to  Sam  that he had not heard laughter, the pure 
line 45502=>sound of merriment, for days upon days without count.  It fell upon his ears 
line 45503=>like  the echo of all the joys he had ever  known. But he himself burst into 
line 45504=>tears. Then, as a  sweet rain will pass down a wind of  spring  and the  sun 
line 45505=>will shine out the  clearer, his  tears  ceased, and his laughter welled up, 
line 45506=>and laughing he sprang from his bed. 
line 45507=>     'How do I feel?' he cried. 'Well, I don't know how to say it. I feel, I 
line 45508=>feel' - he waved his arms in the air  - 'I feel like spring after winter, and 
line 45509=>sun on the leaves; and like trumpets and harps and all the songs I have ever  
line 45510=>heard!' He stopped and he turned towards his  master. 'But how's Mr. Frodo?' 
line 45511=>he said. 'Isn't it a shame about  his poor hand? But  I hope he's all  right 
line 45512=>otherwise. He's had a cruel time.' 
line 45513=>     'Yes, I am all right otherwise,' said Frodo, sitting up and laughing in 
line 45514=>his turn. I fell asleep again waiting  for  you, Sam,  you sleepyhead. I was 
line 45515=>awake early this morning, and now it must be nearly noon.' 
line 45516=>     'Noon?' said Sam, trying to calculate. 'Noon of what day? ' 
line 45517=>     'The fourteenth  of the New Year,' said Gandalf; 'or  if you like,  the 
line 45518=>eighth day of April in the Shire reckoning.( But in Gondor the New Year will 
line 45519=>
line 45520=>####-always now begin upon  the twenty -fifth  of March when Sauron fell, and when 
line 45521=>you were brought out of the fire to the King. He has  tended you, and now he 
line 45522=>awaits you. You shall eat and drink with him. When you are ready I will lead 
line 45523=>you to him.' 
line 45524=>     'The King?' said Sam. 'What king, and who is he?' 
line 45525=>     'The King of Gondor and Lord  of the Western Lands,' said  Gandalf 'and  
line 45526=>he has taken back all his ancient realm. He will ride soon  to his crowning, 
line 45527=>but he waits for you.' 
line 45528=>     'What shall  we  wear?' said Sam; for all he could  see was the old and 
line 45529=>tattered clothes that  they  had journeyed  in, lying  folded  on the ground 
line 45530=>beside their beds.  
line 45531=>     'The clothes that you wore on your way  to Mordor,' said Gandalf. 'Even 
line 45532=>the orc-rags that you bore in the black land;  Frodo, shall be preserved. No 
line 45533=>silks  and linens, nor any armour or heraldry  could be more honourable. But 
line 45534=>later I will find some other clothes, perhaps.' 
line 45535=>     Then he held out his hands to  them, and they  saw that one shone  with 
line 45536=>light. 'What have you got there?' Frodo cried. 'Can it be - ? ' 
line 45537=>     'Yes, I  have brought your two treasures.  They  were found on Sam when 
line 45538=>you were rescued.  The  Lady Galadriel's gifts: your glass,  Frodo, and your 
line 45539=>box, Sam. You will be glad to have these safe again.' 
line 45540=>     When they were washed and clad, and had eaten a light meal, the Hobbits 
line 45541=>followed  Gandalf.  They  stepped out of  the beech-grove in which  they had 
line 45542=>lain, and passed on to  a long green  lawn, glowing in sunshine, bordered by 
line 45543=>stately dark-leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom. Behind them they could  
line 45544=>hear the  sound of falling water, and a stream  ran down before them between 
line 45545=>flowering banks, until it came to a greenwood at the lawn's foot and  passed 
line 45546=>then on under an archway of trees, through  which they saw  the  shimmer  of 
line 45547=>water far away. 
line 45548=>     As they  came  to the opening in the wood, they were surprised  to  see 
line 45549=>knights in bright mail and tall  guards in silver and black  standing there, 
line 45550=>who greeted them with honour and bowed before them. And then one blew a 
line 45551=>long 
line 45552=>trumpet, and  they  went on through the  aisle of trees  beside  the singing 
line 45553=>stream. So they came  to  a wide green land, and beyond it was a broad river  
line 45554=>in a silver haze, out of which rose  a  long wooded isle, and many ships lay 
line 45555=>by its shores. But on the field where they now stood  a great host was drawn 
line 45556=>up,  in  ranks  and  companies glittering  in  the  sun.  And as the Hobbits 
line 45557=>
line 45558=>####-approached swords were  unsheathed, and  spears  were  shaken, and horns and 
line 45559=>trumpets sang, and men cried with many voices and in many tongues:  
line 45560=>     'Long live the Halflings! Praise them with great praise! 
line 45561=>     Cuio i Pheriain anann! Aglar'ni Pheriannath! 
line 45562=>     Praise them with great praise, Frodo and Samwise! 
line 45563=>     Daur a Berhael, Conin en Annyn! Eglerio! 
line 45564=>     Praise them! 
line 45565=>     Eglerio! 
line 45566=>     A laita te, laita te! Andave laituvalmet! 
line 45567=>     Praise them! 
line 45568=>     Cormacolindor, a laita tbrienna! 
line 45569=>     Praise them! The Ring-bearers, praise them with great praise!'  
line 45570=>     And  so the  red blood blushing in their faces  and their eyes  shining 
line 45571=>with wonder, Frodo  and Sam went forward  and saw  that amidst the 
line 45572=>clamorous 
line 45573=>host were set three high-seats  built of green turves. Behind the seat  upon 
line 45574=>the right floated, white on green, a great horse running free; upon the left  
line 45575=>was a banner, silver upon  blue, a ship swan-prowed faring on  the sea;  but 
line 45576=>behind the highest throne in the midst of all a great standard was spread in 
line 45577=>the  breeze,  and there a white  tree flowered upon a sable  field beneath a  
line 45578=>shining crown and seven glittering stars. On the throne sat a mail-clad man, 
line 45579=>a great sword was laid  across his knees, but he wore no  helm. As they drew 
line 45580=>near he rose. And then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of 
line 45581=>face, kingly, lord of Men, dark-haired with eyes of grey. 
line 45582=>     Frodo  ran to meet  him, and Sam  followed close behind. 'Well, if that 
line 45583=>isn't the crown of all!' he said. 'Strider, or I'm still asleep!' 
line 45584=>     'Yes, Sam, Strider,'  said Aragorn. 'It is a long way, is  it not, from 
line 45585=>Bree, where you did not like the look of me? A long way for us all but yours 
line 45586=>has been the darkest road.' 
line 45587=>     And then to Sam's surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before 
line 45588=>them; and taking them by the hand,  Frodo upon  his  right and Sam upon  his 
line 45589=>left, he led them to the throne, and  setting them upon it, he turned to the 
line 45590=>men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the 
line 45591=>host, crying: 
line 45592=>     'Praise them with great praise!' 
line 45593=>     And  when  the glad shout had swelled up and died away  again, to Sam's 
line 45594=>final and  complete satisfaction  and pure joy, a  minstrel of Gondor  stood 
line 45595=>
line 45596=>####-forth, and knelt, and begged leave to sing. And behold! he said: 
line 45597=>     'Lo! lords and knights and  men of valour unashamed, kings and princes,  
line 45598=>and fair people of Gondor, and Riders of Rohan,  and ye sons of  Elrond, and 
line 45599=>D®nedain  of the North, and Elf and Dwarf, and greathearts of the Shire, and 
line 45600=>all free folk of the West, now  listen to my lay. For  I will sing to you of 
line 45601=>Frodo of the Nine Fingers and the Ring of Doom.' 
line 45602=>     And when  Sam  heard that he laughed aloud for  sheer delight,  and  he 
line 45603=>stood  up and cried:  'O great glory and  splendour! And all my wishes  have  
line 45604=>come true!' And then he wept. 
line 45605=>     And all  the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their merriment 
line 45606=>and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all 
line 45607=>men  were hushed. And he  sang to them, now in the  Elven-tongue, now in the 
line 45608=>speech  of  the  West,  until   their  hearts,  wounded  with  sweet  words, 
line 45609=>overflowed, and their joy was like swords, and they passed in thought out to 
line 45610=>regions where pain and delight flow together and tears are the  ver y wine of 
line 45611=>blessedness.  
line 45612=>     And at the last, as the Sun fell from the  noon and the  shadows of the 
line 45613=>trees lengthened,  he  ended. 'Praise them  with  great praise!' he said and 
line 45614=>knelt. And then Aragorn stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to 
line 45615=>pavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted. 
line 45616=>     Frodo and Sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old 
line 45617=>raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen  
line 45618=>was  given  to them. Then  Gandalf came and in his  arms,  to the  wonder of  
line 45619=>Frodo, he  bore  the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had 
line 45620=>been taken from him in Mordor. For Sam he brought a coat of gilded mail, and 
line 45621=>his elven-cloak all healed of  the soils and hurts that it had suffered; and 
line 45622=>then he laid before them two swords. 
line 45623=>     'I do not wish for any sword,' said Frodo. 
line 45624=>     'Tonight at least you should wear one,' said Gandalf. 
line 45625=>     Then Frodo took the small sword that had belonged to Sam, and had  been 
line 45626=>laid at his side in Cirith Ungol. 'Sting I gave to you Sam,' he said. 
line 45627=>     'No, master!  Mr. Bilbo gave it  to you,  and  it goes with his  silver  
line 45628=>coat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.' 
line 45629=>     Frodo gave way; and  Gandalf, as if  he  were their esquire, knelt  and 
line 45630=>girt  the sword-belts about them, and  then rising he set circlets of silver  
line 45631=>upon their heads. And when they were arrayed  they went  to the great feast; 
line 45632=>and  they sat at the King's table with Gandalf, and King Jomer of Rohan, and 
line 45633=>
line 45634=>####-the Prince Imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were Gimli and 
line 45635=>Legolas.  
line 45636=>     But  when, after the  Standing Silence, wine was brought there came  in 
line 45637=>two esquires to  serve  the kings; or  so they seemed to be: one was clad in 
line 45638=>the silver and sable of the Guards  of Minas Tirith, and the other  in white 
line 45639=>and green. But Sam wondered  what such young boys were  doing in an  army 
line 45640=>of 
line 45641=>mighty men. Then suddenly  as they  drew near and he could see them plainly, 
line 45642=>he exclaimed: 
line 45643=>     'Why, look Mr. Frodo! Look here! Well, if it isn't Pippin. Mr. Peregrin 
line 45644=>Took I should say, and Mr.  Merry! How they have grown! Bless  me! But I 
line 45645=>can 
line 45646=>see there's more tales to tell than ours.' 
line 45647=>     'There  are indeed,' said Pippin turning towards him. 'And  we'll begin 
line 45648=>telling them,  as soon  as this feast is ended. In the meantime you  can try 
line 45649=>Gandalf. He's not so close as he used to be,  though he laughs now more than 
line 45650=>he talks.  For the present Merry and I are busy.  We are knights of the City 
line 45651=>and of the Mark, as I hope you observe.' 
line 45652=>     At  last the glad day ended; and  when  the Sun  was gone and the  round 
line 45653=>Moon  rode  slowly  above  the  mists of  Anduin  and flickered through  the 
line 45654=>fluttering  leaves,  Frodo and  Sam sat under the whispering  trees amid the 
line 45655=>fragrance of fair Ithilien; and they talked deep into the  night  with Merry 
line 45656=>and Pippin  and Gandalf, and after  a  while Legolas  and Gimli joined them. 
line 45657=>There Frodo and  Sam learned much  of all that had happened to  the  Company 
line 45658=>after their fellowship was broken on the  evil day  at Parth Galen by Rauros 
line 45659=>Falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell. 
line 45660=>     Orcs, and talking  trees, and leagues of  grass,  and galloping riders. 
line 45661=>and  glittering caves, and white towers and  golden halls, and  battles, and 
line 45662=>tall  ships  sailing,  all  these  passed  before  Sam's  mind until he felt 
line 45663=>bewildered.  But  amidst  all  these  wonders  he  returned  always  to  his 
line 45664=>astonishment at the size of Merry and Pippin; and he made them stand back to 
line 45665=>back with Frodo and himself. He scratched his head. 'Can't understand it  at 
line 45666=>your  age!' he  said. 'But there it is: you're three  inches taller than you  
line 45667=>ought to he, or I'm a dwarf.' 
line 45668=>     'That you certainly are not,' said  Gimli. 'But what did I say? Mortals 
line 45669=>cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a  
line 45670=>pot of beer.' 
line 45671=>
line 45672=>####-     'Ent-draughts?' said Sam. 'There you go about Ents again; but what they 
line 45673=>are beats me. Why, it  will take weeks before we  get all these things sized 
line 45674=>up!' 
line 45675=>     'Weeks indeed,' said Pippin. 'And then Frodo will have  to be locked up 
line 45676=>in a tower in Minas Tirith and  write it  all down. Otherwise he will forget 
line 45677=>half of it, and poor old Bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed.' 
line 45678=>     At length  Gandalf rose. 'The hands of the King  are  hands of healing, 
line 45679=>dear friends,' he  said.  'But you  went  to the very brink of death ere  he 
line 45680=>recalled  you,  putting forth all his power,  and  sent you  into the  sweet 
line 45681=>forgetfulness of sleep. And though you have indeed slept long and blessedly, 
line 45682=>still it is now time to sleep again.' 
line 45683=>     And not  only Sam and Frodo  here, said  Gimli, but you too, Pippin.  I 
line 45684=>love you, if only because of the pains you have cost me, which I shall never  
line 45685=>forget. Nor shall I forget  finding you on the hill of  the last battle. But 
line 45686=>for Gimli the Dwarf you  would have been lost  then. But at least I know now 
line 45687=>the look of a  hobbit's foot, though it be all that can be seen under a heap 
line 45688=>of bodies.  And when  I heaved that  great  carcase off you, I made sure you  
line 45689=>were dead. I could have.  torn out my beard. And it is only a day  yet since 
line 45690=>you were first up and abroad again. To bed now you go. And so shall I.' 
line 45691=>     'And  I,'  said  Legolas, 'shall walk in  the woods of this  fair land, 
line 45692=>which is rest enough. In days to come, if my Elven-lord allows, some of  our 
line 45693=>folk shall remove hither; and when we come it shall be blessed, for a while. 
line 45694=>For a while: a month, a life,  a hundred years  of Men.  But Anduin is near, 
line 45695=>and Anduin leads down to the Sea. To the Sea! 
line 45696=>     To the Sea, to the Sea! The white gulls are crying, 
line 45697=>     The wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying. 
line 45698=>     West, west away, the round sun is falling. 
line 45699=>     Grey ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling. 
line 45700=>     The voices of my people that have gone before me? 
line 45701=>     I will leave, I will leave the wo ods that bore me; 
line 45702=>     For our days are ending and our years failing. 
line 45703=>     I will pass the wide waters lonely sailing. 
line 45704=>     Long are the waves on the Last Shore falling, 
line 45705=>     Sweet are the voices in the Lost Isle calling, 
line 45706=>     In Eressla, in Elvenhome that no man can discover, 
line 45707=>     Where the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!'  
line 45708=>     And so singing Legolas went away down the hill. 
line 45709=>
line 45710=>####-     Then the others also departed, and Frodo and Sam went to their beds and 
line 45711=>slept. And in the morning they  rose again in hope and peace; and they spent 
line 45712=>many days  in  Ithilien. For the Field of Cormallen, where the host was  now 
line 45713=>encamped was near to Henneth  Annyn,  and  the stream that  flowed  from its 
line 45714=>falls could be heard  in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate, 
line 45715=>and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of Anduin by the Isle of  
line 45716=>Cair Andros. The hobbits wandered here  and there visiting again the  places  
line 45717=>that  they had passed before; and Sam hoped always  in  some shadow  of  the 
line 45718=>woods or secret glade to catch, maybe, a glimpse of the great Oliphaunt. And 
line 45719=>when he learned that at the siege of Gondor there had been a great number of 
line 45720=>these beasts but that they were all destroyed, he thought it a sad loss.  
line 45721=>     'Well, one  can't be everywhere  at once, I  suppose,'  he said. 'But I 
line 45722=>missed a lot, seemingly.' 
line 45723=>     In the meanwhile  the host made  ready for  the return to Minas Tirith. 
line 45724=>The weary rested and the hurt were healed. For some had laboured and  fought 
line 45725=>much with the remnants  of  the  Easterlings  and Southrons, until  all were 
line 45726=>subdued. And, latest of  all, those returned who had passed into  Mordor and 
line 45727=>destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land. 
line 45728=>     But  at the last when the month of May was drawing near the Captains of 
line 45729=>the West set out a gain; and they  went  aboard ship with all  their men, and 
line 45730=>they  sailed  from  Cair Andros  down Anduin to  Osgiliath; and  there  they  
line 45731=>remained for one day; and the day after they came to the green fields of the 
line 45732=>Pelennor and saw again the white  towers  under tall Mindolluin, the City of 
line 45733=>the  Men of Gondor, last memory  of Westernesse, that had passed through the 
line 45734=>darkness and fire to a new day. 
line 45735=>     And there in the  midst of the fields they set up  their pavilions  and 
line 45736=>awaited the morning; for it was the Eve of May, and the King would enter his 
line 45737=>gates with the rising of the Sun. 
line 45738=> 
line 45739=>
line 45740=>####- 
line 45741=>
line 45742=>Chapter 5. The Steward and the King 
line 45743=>
line 45744=> 
line 45745=> 
line 45746=>     Over  the city of Gondor doubt and  great  dread had hung. Fair weather  
line 45747=>and clear  sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose days  held  little hope, 
line 45748=>and  who  looked each  morning  for  news  of doom. Their lord was  dead and 
line 45749=>burned, dead lay the King of Rohan in their citadel,  and the  new king that 
line 45750=>had  come to them in the night was gone again to  a war with powers too dark 
line 45751=>and terrible for any might or valour to conquer. And no news came. After the 
line 45752=>host left Morgul Vale and  took the northward road beneath the shadow of the 
line 45753=>mountains no messenger had  returned nor any rumour  of what was passing  in 
line 45754=>the brooding East. 
line 45755=>     When the Captains were but two days gone, the Lady Jowyn bade the 
line 45756=>women 
line 45757=>who tended her  to  bring her  raiment, and she would  not  be gainsaid, but 
line 45758=>rose; and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen, she 
line 45759=>went to the Warden of the Houses of Healing. 
line 45760=>     'Sir,' she  said, 'I am in great  unrest,  and  I cannot lie longer  in 
line 45761=>sloth.' 
line 45762=>     'Lady,' he answered, 'you are  not  yet  healed, and I was commanded to 
line 45763=>tend you  with especial care. You should  not  have risen  from your bed for  
line 45764=>seven days yet , or so I was bidden. I beg you to go back.' 
line 45765=>     'I am  healed,' she said,  'healed at  least in body, save  my left arm 
line 45766=>only, and  that is at ease. But I shall sicken anew, if there is naught that 
line 45767=>I can do. Are there no tidings of war? The women can tell  me nothing.' 
line 45768=>     'There are  no tidings,' said the Warden,  'save  that  the  Lords have 
line 45769=>ridden to Morgul Vale; and men say that the new captain out  of the North is 
line 45770=>their chief. A great lord is that, and a  healer;  and it is a thing passing 
line 45771=>strange to me that  the healing hand should  also wield the sword. It is not 
line 45772=>thus  in Gondor now,  though once it was  so, if old tales be  true. But for  
line 45773=>long years we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of 
line 45774=>swords. Though we should still have enough  to do without them: the world is 
line 45775=>full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them.' 
line 45776=>     It needs but one foe to breed a war, not two,  Master  Warden, answered 
line 45777=>Jowyn. 'And those who  have not swords can  still die  upon them. Would  you  
line 45778=>have  the folk  of Gondor gather you herbs  only, when the Dark Lord gathers 
line 45779=>
line 45780=>####-armies? And it  is not  always good  to be healed in  body. Nor is it always 
line 45781=>evil to die in battle, even  in bitter pain. Were I permitted,  in this dark 
line 45782=>hour I would choose the latter.' 
line 45783=>     The Warden looked at her. Tall she stood there, her eyes  bright in her  
line 45784=>white face, her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out of his window that 
line 45785=>opened to the East. He sighed and shook his head. After a pause  she  turned 
line 45786=>to him again. 
line 45787=>     'Is there no deed to do?' she said. 'Who commands in this City?' 
line 45788=>     'I do not  rightly know,' he  answered. 'Such things are  not my  care. 
line 45789=>There is a marshal over the Riders  of Rohan; and the Lord H®rin, I am told, 
line 45790=>commands the men of Gondor. But  the Lord Faramir is by right the Steward of 
line 45791=>the City.' 
line 45792=>     'Where can I find him?' 
line 45793=>     'In this house, lady. He was sorely  hurt,  but is now set again on the 
line 45794=>way to health. But I do not know--' 
line 45795=>     'Will you not bring me to him? Then you will know. ' 
line 45796=>     The Lord  Faramir was  walking  alone in  the garden  of the  Houses of 
line 45797=>Healing, and the sunlight warmed him, and he felt life run new in his veins; 
line 45798=>but his heart  was heavy, and he looked  out  over the  walls  eastward. And 
line 45799=>coming, the Warden  spoke his name, and he turned and saw the Lady  Jowyn 
line 45800=>of 
line 45801=>Rohan; and he  was  moved with pity, for  he saw that she was hurt,  and his 
line 45802=>clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest. 
line 45803=>     'My lord,' said  the Warden, 'here is the Lady Jowyn of Rohan. She rode 
line 45804=>wi th the king and  was sorely hurt, and dwells now in my keeping. But she is 
line 45805=>not content, and she wishes to speak to the Steward of the City.' 
line 45806=>     'Do not misunderstand him, lord,'  said Jowyn. 'It is not lack  of care 
line 45807=>that  grieves me.  No  houses  could be  fairer, for those who  desire to be 
line 45808=>healed.  But I  cannot  lie  in sloth,  idle,  caged. I looked  for death in 
line 45809=>battle. But I have not died, and battle still goes on.' 
line 45810=>     At a sign from  Faramir, the Warden bowed and departed. 'What would you  
line 45811=>have me do, lady?' said Faramir.  'I also am a prisoner of the healers.'  He 
line 45812=>looked  at her, and being a man  whom pity deeply stirred,  it seemed to him 
line 45813=>that her loveliness amid her grief would pierce his heart. And she looked at 
line 45814=>him and saw the grave tenderness in his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred 
line 45815=>among men of war, that here was one whom no Rider of the Mark would 
line 45816=>outmatch 
line 45817=>
line 45818=>####-in battle. 
line 45819=>     'What  do you wish?' he said again. 'If  it lies in my power, I will do 
line 45820=>it.' 
line 45821=>     'I would have  you  command this  Warden, and bid him  let me go,'  she 
line 45822=>said; but though her words were still proud, her heart faltered, and for the 
line 45823=>first time she doubted herself. She  guessed  that this tall man, both stern 
line 45824=>and  gentle, might think  her merely wayward, like a child that has not  the 
line 45825=>firmness of mind to go on with a dull task to the end. 
line 45826=>     'I myself am  in the Warden's  keeping,' answered Faramir. 'Nor  have I 
line 45827=>yet taken  up my authority in the City. But  had I done so,  I  should still 
line 45828=>listen to  his counsel,  and should  not cross  his will in  matters of  his 
line 45829=>craft, unless in some great need.' 
line 45830=>     'But I do not desire healing,' she said. 'I wish to ride to war like my 
line 45831=>brother Jomer, or better  like  Thjoden the king, for he  died  and has both 
line 45832=>honour and peace.' 
line 45833=>     'It  is too late, lady,  to follow the Captains, even  if you  had  the 
line 45834=>strength,'  said Faramir.  'But death  in battle  may  come  to  us all yet, 
line 45835=>willing  or unwilling. You will be  better prepared to  face it in your  own 
line 45836=>manner, if while there is still time you do as the Healer commanded. You and 
line 45837=>I, we must endure with patience the hours of waiting.' 
line 45838=>     She  did not answer, but  as  he looked  at her it  seemed to  him that 
line 45839=>something  in her  softened, as though  a bitter frost  were yielding at the 
line 45840=>first faint presage of Spring. A  tear sprang in her  eye  and fell down her  
line 45841=>cheek, like  a  glistening rain-drop.  Her proud head drooped a little. Then 
line 45842=>quietly, more as if speaking  to herself than to him: 'But the healers would 
line 45843=>have me lie abed seven days yet,'  she said. 'And  my  window does not  look 
line 45844=>eastward.' Her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad. 
line 45845=>     Faramir  smiled, though his heart was  filled with  pity.  'Your window 
line 45846=>does not look eastward?'  he said. 'That  can be  amended.  In  this I  will 
line 45847=>command  the Warden. If  you will stay in this  house in our care, lady, and 
line 45848=>take your rest, then you  shall walk in this garden in the sun, as you will; 
line 45849=>and you shall  look east, whither all our hopes have gone. And here you will  
line 45850=>find me, walking and waiting, and also looking east.  It would ease my care,  
line 45851=>if you would speak to me, or walk at whiles with me.' 
line 45852=>     Then she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again; and a colour 
line 45853=>came in her  pale face.  'How should I ease your care,  my  lord?' she said. 
line 45854=>'And I do not desire the speech of living men.' 
line 45855=>
line 45856=>####-     'Would you have my plain answer?' he said. 
line 45857=>     'I would.' 
line 45858=>     'Then, Jowyn  of Rohan, I say to  you  that you  are  beautiful. In the 
line 45859=>valleys  of our hills there are flowers fair  and bright, and maidens fairer  
line 45860=>still; but neither flower nor lady have I seen till now in Gondor so lovely, 
line 45861=>and so sorrowful. It may be that only a few days are left ere darkness falls 
line 45862=>upon our world,  and when it comes I hope to  face it steadily; but it would 
line 45863=>ea se my heart, if while the Sun yet shines, I  could see you  still. For you  
line 45864=>and I have both passed under the wings of the Shadow, and the same hand drew 
line 45865=>us back.' 
line 45866=>     'Alas, not me, lord!' she said. 'Shadow  lies on me still.  Look not to 
line 45867=>me for healing! I am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungentle. But I thank you  
line 45868=>for this at least, that I need not keep to my chamber. I will walk abroad by 
line 45869=>the grace of the Steward of the City.' And she did him a courtesy and walked 
line 45870=>back to the house. But Faramir for a long while walked  alone in the garden,  
line 45871=>and his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls. 
line 45872=>     When he returned to his chamber he called for the Warden, and heard all  
line 45873=>that he could tell of the Lady of Rohan. 
line 45874=>     'But I doubt  not,  lor d,'  said the Warden, 'that you would learn more 
line 45875=>from the Halfling that is with us; for he was in the riding of the king, and 
line 45876=>with the Lady at the end, they say.' 
line 45877=>     And so Merry was sent to Faramir, and while that day lasted they talked 
line 45878=>long  together, and  Faramir  learned  much, more  even  than Merry put into 
line 45879=>words; and  he  thought  that he understood now  something of the grief  and 
line 45880=>unrest of Jowyn of Rohan. And in the  fair evening Faramir and  Merry walked 
line 45881=>in the garden, but she did not come. 
line 45882=>     But in the morning, as Faramir came from the Houses, he saw her, as she 
line 45883=>stood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and gleamed in the sun. 
line 45884=>And he called to her, and she came down, and they walked on the grass or sat 
line 45885=>under a green  tree  together , now in  silence, now in speech. And  each day 
line 45886=>after they did likewise. And the Warden looking  from his window was glad in 
line 45887=>heart.  for  he was a healer. and his care was lightened; and certain it was 
line 45888=>that, heavy as was the dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of 
line 45889=>men, still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength. 
line 45890=>     And so the  fifth day came since the Lady Jowyn went  first to Faramir; 
line 45891=>and they stood now together once more upon the walls of  the City and looked 
line 45892=>out. No tidings  had  yet come, and all hearts  were darkened. The  weather, 
line 45893=>
line 45894=>####-too, was  bright  no  longer. It was cold. A wind  that had sprung up in the 
line 45895=>night was  blowing  now keenly from  the North, and it was  rising; but  the 
line 45896=>lands about looked grey and dr ear. 
line 45897=>     They were clad in warm  raiment and heavy cloaks, and over all the Lady  
line 45898=>Jowyn wore a  great blue  mantle of  the colour of deep summer -night, and it  
line 45899=>was set with silver stars  about hem and  throat. Faramir had  sent for this 
line 45900=>robe and had wrapped  it about her;  and he thought that  she looked fair and  
line 45901=>queenly indeed as  she stood there at  his  side. The mantle was wrought for  
line 45902=>his  mother,  Finduilas of Amroth,  who died untimely, and was  to him but a 
line 45903=>memory of loveliness in far days and of his first grief; and her robe seemed 
line 45904=>to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of Jowyn. 
line 45905=>     But  she  now  shivered  beneath the  starry  mantle,  and  she  looked 
line 45906=>northward, above the grey hither lands, into the eye of the  cold wind where 
line 45907=>far away the sky was hard and clear. 
line 45908=>     'What do you look for, Jowyn?' said Faramir. 
line 45909=>     'Does not the Black Gate lie yonder?' said she. 'And must he not now be 
line 45910=>come thither? It is seven days since he rode away.' 
line 45911=>     'Seven days,' said Faramir. 'But think not il l of me, if I say  to you: 
line 45912=>they have brought me both a joy and a pain that I never thought to know. Joy 
line 45913=>to see you; but pain, because now the fear  and doubt  of this evil time are 
line 45914=>grown dark  indeed. Jowyn, I would  not have this world end now, or lose  so 
line 45915=>soon what I have found.' 
line 45916=>     'Lose what you have found,  lord?' she answered; but she looked at  him 
line 45917=>gravely and her eyes  were  kind. 'I know  not what in  these days you  have 
line 45918=>found that you could lose. But come, my friend,  let us not speak of it! Let 
line 45919=>us not speak at all! I  stand  upon some dreadful  brink,  and it is utterly 
line 45920=>dark in the abyss before my feet, but whether there is any light behind me I 
line 45921=>cannot tell. For I cannot turn yet. I wait for some stroke of doom.' 
line 45922=>     'Yes, we wait for the stroke of doom,' said Faramir.  And  they said no 
line 45923=>more; and it seemed to them as  they stood upon the wall that the wind died,  
line 45924=>and the light failed, and the Sun was bleared, and all sounds in the City or  
line 45925=>in the  lands about were hushed: neither wind, nor voice , nor bird-call, nor  
line 45926=>rustle  of leaf,  nor  their own breath could  be heard; the very beating of 
line 45927=>their hearts was stilled. Time halted. 
line 45928=>     And as they stood so, their hands met and  clasped, though they did not 
line 45929=>know  it.  And still  they waited for they   knew not what. Then presently it 
line 45930=>seemed to them that above the ridges  of the distant  mountains another vast  
line 45931=>
line 45932=>####-mountain of darkness  rose, towering up like a wave  that  should engulf the 
line 45933=>world, and about it  lightnings flickered; and then a tremor ran through the 
line 45934=>earth, and they felt the  walls of the City quiver. A sound like a sigh went 
line 45935=>up from all the lands about them; and their hearts beat suddenly again. 
line 45936=>     'It  reminds me of N®menor,' said Faramir, and wondered to hear himself 
line 45937=>speak. 
line 45938=>     'Of N®menor?' said Jowyn. 
line 45939=>     'Yes,' said Faramir, 'of the land of Westernesse that  foundered and of 
line 45940=>the great dark wave climbing  over the green lands and above the hills,  and 
line 45941=>coming on, darkness unescapable. I often dream of it.' 
line 45942=>     'Then  you  think that the  Darkness is coming?' said Jowyn.  'Darkness 
line 45943=>Unescapable?' And suddenly she drew close to him. 
line 45944=>     'No,' said Faramir, looking into her face. 'It was but a picture in the 
line 45945=>mind. I do not know what is happening. The reason of my waking mind tells 
line 45946=>me 
line 45947=>that great evil  has befallen and we  stand at the end of days. But my heart 
line 45948=>says nay; and all my limbs are light, and a hope and joy are come to me that 
line 45949=>no reason can deny. Jowyn, Jowyn, White Lady of Rohan, in this hour I do not 
line 45950=>believe that any darkness will endure!' And he stooped and kissed her brow.  
line 45951=>     And so they stood on the walls of the City of Gondor,  and a great wind 
line 45952=>rose and blew, and  their hair, raven  and golden, streamed out  mingling in 
line 45953=>the air. And the Shadow departed, and the Sun was unveiled, and light leaped 
line 45954=>forth; and the waters of Anduin shone like silver, and in all  the houses of 
line 45955=>the  City  men  sang for  the joy that welled  up in their hearts  from what 
line 45956=>source they could not tell. 
line 45957=>     And before the Sun had fallen far  from the noon out of  the East there 
line 45958=>came a great Eagle flying, and he bore tidings beyond hope from the Lords of 
line 45959=>the West, crying: 
line 45960=>     Sing now, ye people of the Tower of Anor, 
line 45961=>     for the Realm of Sauron is ended for ever, 
line 45962=>     and the Dark Tower is thrown down. 
line 45963=> 
line 45964=>     Sing and rejoice, ye people of the Tower of Guard, 
line 45965=>     for your watch hath not been in vain, 
line 45966=>     and the Black Gate is broken, 
line 45967=>     and your King hath passed through, 
line 45968=>     and he is victorious. 
line 45969=>
line 45970=>####- 
line 45971=>     Sing and be glad, all ye children of the West, 
line 45972=>     for your King shall come again, 
line 45973=>     and he shall dwell among you 
line 45974=>     all the days of your life. 
line 45975=> 
line 45976=>     And the Tree that was withered shall be renewed, 
line 45977=>     and he shall plant it in the high places, 
line 45978=>     and the City shall be blessed. 
line 45979=> 
line 45980=>     Sing all ye people! 
line 45981=>     And the people sang in all the ways of the City. 
line 45982=>     The  days  that followed were golden,  and Spring and Summer joined and 
line 45983=>made revel  together in  the fields of Gondor. And tidings now came by swift 
line 45984=>riders from Cair  Andros of all  that  was done, and the City made ready for  
line 45985=>the coming of the King. Merry was summoned and rode away with the wains 
line 45986=>that 
line 45987=>took store  of  goods to Osgiliath and thence by  ship  to Cair  Andros; but 
line 45988=>Faramir did not go,  for now being healed he took upon him his authority and 
line 45989=>the  Stewardship, although it was only for a little while, and his duty  was 
line 45990=>to prepare for one who should replace him. 
line 45991=>     And Jowyn did not go, though her brother sent  word begging her to come 
line 45992=>to  the  field of  Cormallen.  And Faramir  wondered at this, but he saw her  
line 45993=>seldom, being  busy  with many matters; and she dwelt still in the Houses of 
line 45994=>Healing and walked alone in the garden, and her face grew pale again, and it  
line 45995=>seemed that  in  all the City she  only  was ailing  and sorrowful.  And the 
line 45996=>Warden of the Houses was troubled, and he spoke to Faramir. 
line 45997=>     Then Faramir came and sought her, and once more they stood on the walls 
line 45998=>together; and he said to  her: 'Jowyn, why  do you tarry here, and do not go 
line 45999=>to the rejoicing in  Cormallen beyond Cair Andros, where your brother awaits 
line 46000=>you?' 
line 46001=>     And she said: 'Do you not know?' 
line 46002=>     But he answered: 'Two reasons there may be, but which is true, l do not 
line 46003=>know.' 
line 46004=>     And she said: 'I do not wish to play at riddles. Speak plainer!' 
line 46005=>     'Then if you  will have it so, lady,' he  said: 'you do  not go, because 
line 46006=>only your brother called for you, and to look on the Lord Aragorn, Elendil's 
line 46007=>
line 46008=>####-heir, in his triumph would now bring you no joy. Or because I do not go, and 
line 46009=>you  desire still to be near me. And maybe for both  these reasons,  and you  
line 46010=>yourself cannot choose between them. Jowyn, do  you not love me, or will you  
line 46011=>not?' 
line 46012=>     'I wished to be loved by another,' she answered. 'But I desire no man's 
line 46013=>pity.' 
line 46014=>     'That I know,' he  said. 'You  desired  to  have  the love  of the Lord 
line 46015=>Aragorn. Because he was high and puissant, and you wished to have renown 
line 46016=>and 
line 46017=>glory and to be  lifted far above the  mean things that crawl on  the earth. 
line 46018=>And as a great captain may to a young soldier  he seemed  to you  admirable. 
line 46019=>For so he is, a lord among men,  the greatest that  now is. But when he gave  
line 46020=>you only  understanding and pity, then you desired to have nothing, unless a  
line 46021=>brave death in battle. Look at me, Jowyn!' 
line 46022=>     And Jowyn  looked at Faramir long and  steadily; and Faramir  said: 'Do 
line 46023=>not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, Jowyn! But I do not offer  
line 46024=>you my pity. For  you  are  a lady high  and valiant  and  have yourself won 
line 46025=>renown that shall not be forgotten; and you  are  a lady  beautiful, I deem, 
line 46026=>beyond even the words of  the Elven-tongue  to tell. And I love  you. Once I  
line 46027=>pitied your sorrow. But now, were you sorrowless, without fear  or any lack, 
line 46028=>were you the blissful Queen of Gondor, still I would love you. Jowyn, do you 
line 46029=>not love me?' 
line 46030=>     Then the heart of Jowyn changed, or else at last she understood it. And 
line 46031=>suddenly her winter passed, and the sun shone on her. 
line 46032=>     I stand in Minas Anor, the Tower of the Sun,  she  said; and behold the 
line 46033=>Shadow has departed! I  will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor  vie  with the  
line 46034=>great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, 
line 46035=>and love all things that  grow and are not barren.' And again  she looked at 
line 46036=>Faramir. 'No longer do I desire to be a queen,' she said. 
line 46037=>     Then Faramir laughed merrily.  'That is well,' he said; 'for I am not  a  
line 46038=>king. Yet I will wed with the White Lady of Rohan, if it be her will. And if 
line 46039=>she  will, then let us cross  the  River and in happier days let us dwell in 
line 46040=>fair Ithilien  and there make a garden. All things will grow with joy there, 
line 46041=>if the White Lady comes.' 
line 46042=>     'Then must I leave my own people, man of Gondor?' she said. 'And  would 
line 46043=>you have  your proud  folk say of you: (There  goes a  lord who tamed a wild 
line 46044=>shieldmaiden  of the North! Was  there  no woman of the race  of N®menor  to 
line 46045=>
line 46046=>####-choose?(' 
line 46047=>     'I  would,'  said  Faramir. And he took her in his arms and  kissed her  
line 46048=>under  the  sunlit sky, and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls 
line 46049=>in  the  sight  of many. And many indeed saw  them  and the light that shone 
line 46050=>about them as they came down from  the  walls  and went hand in hand  to the 
line 46051=>Houses of Healing. 
line 46052=>     And to the Warden of  the Houses Faramir said:  'Here is the Lady Jowyn 
line 46053=>of Rohan, and now she is healed.' 
line 46054=>     And the  Warden  said: 'Then I release her from  my charge and bid  her  
line 46055=>farewell, and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again. I commend her to 
line 46056=>the care of the Steward of the City, until her brother returns.' 
line 46057=>     But Jowyn said:  'Yet  now that I have leave to depart, I would remain. 
line 46058=>For this House has become to me of all dwellings  the most blessed.' And she 
line 46059=>remained there until King Jomer came. 
line 46060=>     All things  were  now  made  ready  in  the City; and there  was  great 
line 46061=>concourse of  people, for the tidings had gone out into all parts of Gondor, 
line 46062=>from Min-Rimmon even to Pinnath Gelin and the far coasts of the sea; and all 
line 46063=>that could  come to the  City made haste  to come.  And the City  was filled 
line 46064=>again with women  and fair children  that returned to their homes laden with 
line 46065=>flowers;  and from Dol Amroth came the harpers that harped most skilfully in 
line 46066=>all the land; and there  were players upon viols and  upon  flutes and  upon 
line 46067=>horns of silver, and clear-voiced singers from the vales of Lebennin. 
line 46068=>     At last an evening came when from the walls the pavilions could be seen 
line 46069=>upon  the field, and all night lights were  burning as men  watched for  the 
line 46070=>dawn. And when the sun rose in  the clear morning above the mountains in the 
line 46071=>East, upon which shadows lay no more, then  all  the bells rang, and all the 
line 46072=>banners  broke  and  flowed in the wind;  and upon  the White  Tower  of the  
line 46073=>citadel the standard of  the Stewards,  bright argent like snow  in the sun, 
line 46074=>bearing no charge nor device, was raised over Gondor for the last time. 
line 46075=>     Now the Captains of the West  led their host towards the City, and folk  
line 46076=>saw them advance in line upon line, flashing and glinting in the sunrise and 
line 46077=>rippling  like silver.  And  so they came  before the Gateway and  halted  a  
line 46078=>furlong from the walls. As yet no gates had been set up again, but a barrier  
line 46079=>was laid across the entrance  to the City, and  there  stood men at  arms in 
line 46080=>silver  and  black with long swords drawn.  Before the barrier stood Faramir  
line 46081=>the Steward, and H®rin Warden of the Keys, and other captains of Gondor, and 
line 46082=>the  Lady  Jowyn of Rohan with Elfhelm the Marshal and many  knights of  the 
line 46083=>
line 46084=>####-Mark; and upon either  side of  the Gate was a great press of fair people in 
line 46085=>raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers.  
line 46086=>     So now there was a wide space before  the walls of Minas Tirith, and it 
line 46087=>was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the  soldiers of Gondor  and 
line 46088=>of Rohan, and by the people of the City and of all parts of the land. A hush 
line 46089=>fell upon all as out from the host stepped  the D®nedain in silver and grey; 
line 46090=>and before  them  came  walking slow the Lord Aragorn. He was  clad in black  
line 46091=>mail  girt  with silver, and  he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at 
line 46092=>the throat with a great jewel  of green that shone  from afar;  but his head 
line 46093=>was bare  save for a star  upon his forehead bound  by a  slender fillet  of 
line 46094=>silver.  With him were Jomer of Rohan,  and the Prince  Imrahil, and Gandalf 
line 46095=>robed all in white, and four small figures that many men marvelled to see. 
line 46096=>     'Nay,  cousin! they are  not  boys,' said Ioreth to her  kinswoman from 
line 46097=>Imloth  Melui,  who stood beside  her. 'Those  are Periain , out  of the  far 
line 46098=>country of  the Halflings, where they are princes of great fame, it is said. 
line 46099=>I should know, for I had one to tend in the Houses. They are small, but they 
line 46100=>are valiant. Why, cousin, one  of them went  with only his esquire  into the 
line 46101=>Black Country and fought with the Dark Lord all by himself, and set fire  to  
line 46102=>his  Tower,  if  you can believe it. At least that is  the tale in the City. 
line 46103=>That will be the one that walks with our Elfstone. They are dear friends,  I 
line 46104=>hear.  Now  he  is  a marvel, the Lord Elfstone: not too soft in his speech, 
line 46105=>mind  you, but  he  has a golden heart,  as  the saying is; and  he has  the 
line 46106=>healing hands. (The hands  of the king are  the  hands of a healer(, I said; 
line 46107=>and  that was how  it  was all  discovered. And  Mithrandir,  he said to me: 
line 46108=>(Ioreth, men will long remember your words(, and--' 
line 46109=>     But  Ioreth  was  not  permitted  to  continue the instruction  of  her  
line 46110=>kinswoman  from  the country,  for a single trumpet rang, and a dead silence 
line 46111=>followed. Then forth from the Gate went  Faramir with H®rin of the Keys, and 
line 46112=>no  others, save  that behind  them  walked four men  in  the high helms and  
line 46113=>armour of the Citadel, and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound 
line 46114=>with silver. 
line 46115=>     Faramir met  Aragorn in  the  midst  of those there  assembled, and  he 
line 46116=>knelt,  and said: 'The last  Steward of Gondor begs  leave to  surrender his 
line 46117=>office.' And he held out a  white rod; but Aragorn took the  rod and gave it 
line 46118=>back, saying:  'That  office is  not ended, and  it shall be thine  and  thy 
line 46119=>heirs' as long as my line shall last. Do now thy office!' 
line 46120=>     Then Faramir stood up and spoke in  a clear voice:  'Men of Gondor hear  
line 46121=>
line 46122=>####-now the  Steward of this Realm! Behold! one has come  to  claim the kingship 
line 46123=>again at last. Here is Aragorn son of Arathorn, chieftain of the D®nedain of  
line 46124=>Arnor,  Captain of the Host of  the West,  bearer of the  Star of the North, 
line 46125=>wielder of  the Sword  Reforged, victorious  in  battle,  whose hands  bring 
line 46126=>healing,  the Elfstone,  Elessar  of  the line of Valandil,  Isildur's  son, 
line 46127=>Elendil's son of N®menor. Shall he be king and enter into the City and dwell 
line 46128=>there?' 
line 46129=>     And all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice. 
line 46130=>     And Ioreth  said  to her kinswoman: 'This is just a ceremony such as we 
line 46131=>have in the City, cousin; for  he has already entered, as I was telling you; 
line 46132=>and he said  to me--' And then again she was obliged to silence, for Faramir 
line 46133=>spoke again. 
line 46134=>     'Men of Gondor, the loremasters tell that it was the custom of old that 
line 46135=>the king should receive the  crown from his father ere  he died; or if  that 
line 46136=>might not be, that  he should  go alone and  take  it from the hands  of his 
line 46137=>father  in the tomb  where  he was  laid.  But since things must now be done  
line 46138=>otherwise,  using the authority of the Steward, I  have today brought hither 
line 46139=>from Rath Dnnen the  crown of Edrnur the last king, whose days passed in the 
line 46140=>time of our longfathers of old.' 
line 46141=>     Then the  guards stepped forward, and Faramir opened the casket, and he 
line 46142=>held up an ancient  crown. It was shaped like the helms of the Guards of the 
line 46143=>Citadel, save  that it was loftier, and it was all  white, and the  wings at 
line 46144=>either side were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of 
line 46145=>a sea -bird, for it was the emblem of kings  who came over the Sea; and seven 
line 46146=>gems  of adamant  were  set  in  the circlet, and upon  its summit was set a  
line 46147=>single jewel the light of which went up like a flame. 
line 46148=>     Then Aragorn took the crown and held it up and said: 
line 46149=>     Et  Edrello  Endorenna  ut®lien.  Sinome  maruvan  ar  Hildinyar  tenn' 
line 46150=>Ambar-metta! 
line 46151=>     And those were the  words that Elendil spoke when he came up out of the 
line 46152=>Sea on the wings  of  the wind: 'Out of  the Great Sea to  M iddle-earth I am 
line 46153=>come.  In this place will I abide,  and  my heirs, unto  the  ending of  the 
line 46154=>world.' 
line 46155=>     Then to the wonder of many Aragorn did not put the crown upon his head, 
line 46156=>but  gave it back to Faramir, and  said: 'By the labour and valour of many I 
line 46157=>have come into my inheritance. In token of this I would have the Ring-bearer 
line 46158=>bring the crown to me,  and let Mithrandir set it upon my  head, if he will; 
line 46159=>
line 46160=>####-for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his 
line 46161=>victory.' 
line 46162=>     Then Frodo  came forward and took the crown from Faramir and bore  it to 
line 46163=>Gandalf; and Aragorn  knelt,  and Gandalf set the White Crown upon his head, 
line 46164=>and said: 
line 46165=>     'Now  come  the days  of the  King, and may  they be blessed  while the 
line 46166=>thrones of the Valar endure!' 
line 46167=>     But when  Aragorn arose  all that beheld him  gazed in  silence, for it 
line 46168=>seemed to them  that he was revealed to them now for the first time. Tall as 
line 46169=>the sea -kings of old, he stood  above all that were near; ancient of days he 
line 46170=>seemed and yet in  the fl ower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow,  and 
line 46171=>strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was  about him. And then 
line 46172=>Faramir cried: 
line 46173=>     'Behold the King!' 
line 46174=>     And  in that moment all the trumpets  were  blown, and the King Elessar  
line 46175=>went  forth  and came to the barrier, and  H®rin  of the Keys thrust it back; 
line 46176=>and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear 
line 46177=>voices the  King passed through  the flower -laden streets,  and  came to the 
line 46178=>Citadel,  and  entered  in;  and the banner  of  the Tree and the Stars  was 
line 46179=>unfurled  upon the topmost tower,  and  the reign of King Elessar began,  of 
line 46180=>which many songs have told. 
line 46181=>     In his time  the City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in 
line 46182=>the  days of  its first  glory;  and it  was  filled  with  trees  and  with 
line 46183=>fountains, and its gates were wrought of mithril  and steel, and its streets 
line 46184=>were paved  with white marble; and the Folk of the Mountain laboured in  it,  
line 46185=>and the Folk of the Wood rejoiced to come there; and all was healed and made 
line 46186=>good, and  the  houses were filled with men  and women  and  the laughter of 
line 46187=>children,  and no window was blind nor any courtyard  empty;  and after  the 
line 46188=>ending  of  the Third  Age of  the world into the  new  age it preserved the 
line 46189=>memory and the glory of the years that were gone. 
line 46190=>     In the days  that  followed his crowning  the King sat on his throne in 
line 46191=>the Hall of the Kings and pronounced his judgements. And embassies came 
line 46192=>from 
line 46193=>many lands and peoples, from the East and the South, and from the borders of 
line 46194=>Mirkwood,  and  from  Dunland  in  the  west.  And  the  King  pardoned  the 
line 46195=>Easterlings that had  given themselves up, and sent them  away free, and  he 
line 46196=>made peace with  the peoples of Harad;  and the slaves of Mordor he released 
line 46197=>
line 46198=>####-and gave  to them all the lands about Lake N®rnen to be their own. And there 
line 46199=>were  brought  before him many to  receive  his praise and reward  for their 
line 46200=>valour; and  last the  captain  of the Guard brought to him  Beregond  to be 
line 46201=>judged. 
line 46202=>     And  the  King said  to  Beregond: 'Beregond, by  your sword blood  was 
line 46203=>spilled  in the Hallows, where that  is forbidden.  Also  you left your post  
line 46204=>without leave of Lord or of Captain. For these things, of old, death was the 
line 46205=>penalty. Now therefore I must pronounce your doom. 
line 46206=>     'All penalty  is remitted  for  your valour in battle,  and still  more 
line 46207=>because all that you  did was for the love of the Lord Faramir.  Nonetheless 
line 46208=>you must leave the Guard of the Citadel, and you must go forth from the City 
line 46209=>of Minas Tirith.' 
line 46210=>     Then the blood left Beregond's face, and he was stricken to  the  heart 
line 46211=>and bowed his head. But the King said.: 
line 46212=>     'So it must be,  for you are  appointed to the White Company, the Guard 
line 46213=>of Faramir,  Prince of Ithilien, and you shall  be its captain  and dwell in 
line 46214=>Emyn  Arnen in  honour  and peace, and in  the service of him  for whom  you  
line 46215=>risked all, to save him from death.' 
line 46216=>     And then Beregond, perceiving the mercy  and justice  of the  King, was 
line 46217=>glad,  and kneeling kissed his hand, and  departed  in joy  and content. And 
line 46218=>Aragorn gave to Faramir Ithilien to  be his princedom, and bade him dwell in 
line 46219=>the hills of Emyn Arnen within sight of the City. 
line 46220=>     'For,' said he, 'Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, 
line 46221=>and though it may in time to come be made clean,  no man may dwell there for  
line 46222=>many long years.' 
line 46223=>     And last of  all Aragorn greeted Jomer of Rohan, and they embraced, and  
line 46224=>Aragorn said: 'Between  us there can be no word of giving or taking,  nor of 
line 46225=>reward; for we are brethren. In happy hour did Eorl ride from the North, and 
line 46226=>never has  any league of peoples been more blessed, so that neither has ever  
line 46227=>failed the other, nor shall fail. Now, as you know, we have laid Thjoden the 
line 46228=>Renowned in a tomb in the Hallows, and there he shall lie for ever among the 
line 46229=>Kings of Gondor, if you will. Or if you desire it, we will come to Rohan and 
line 46230=>bring him back to rest with his own people.' 
line 46231=>     And Jomer answered: 'Since the day when you rose before me  out of  the 
line 46232=>green grass of the downs I have loved you , and that love shall not fail. But 
line 46233=>now I must depart  for a while to my own realm, where there is much  to heal 
line 46234=>and set in order.  But as for  the Fallen,  when  all is made ready we  will 
line 46235=>
line 46236=>####-return for him; but here let him sleep a while.' 
line 46237=>     And Jowyn  said to Faramir: 'Now I must go back to my own land and look  
line 46238=>on it once again, and help my brother in his labour;  but  when  one  whom I  
line 46239=>long loved as father is laid at last to rest, I will return.' 
line 46240=>     So  the  glad days  passed; and on the  eighth day o f May the Riders of 
line 46241=>Rohan made ready, and rode off by the North-way, and with them went the 
line 46242=>sons 
line 46243=>of Elrond. All the road  was lined with people to do them  honour and praise 
line 46244=>them, from the Gate of the City  to  the  walls of the  Pelennor.  Then  all 
line 46245=>others that dwelt afar went back to their homes  rejoicing; but in the  City 
line 46246=>there was  labour of many willing hands to  rebuild  and renew and to remove 
line 46247=>all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness.  
line 46248=>     The hobbits still remained in Minas Tirith, with Legolas and Gimli; for  
line 46249=>Aragorn  was  loth for the fellowship  to be dissolved. 'At  last  all  such 
line 46250=>things must end,' he said, 'but I would have you wait a little while longer: 
line 46251=>for  the end  of the deeds  that you have  shared in has not yet come. A day 
line 46252=>draws near that  I have looked for in all the years of my manhood,  and when 
line 46253=>it comes I would have my friends beside me.' But of that day he would say no 
line 46254=>more. 
line 46255=>     In those days the Companions of the Ring dwelt together in a fair house 
line 46256=>with Gandalf,  and  they went to and fro as  they  wished. And Frodo said to 
line 46257=>Gandalf:  'Do you know what this  day is that  Aragorn speaks of? For we are 
line 46258=>happy here, and I don't wish to go; but the days are running away, and Bilbo  
line 46259=>is waiting; and the Shire is my home.' 
line 46260=>     'As for  Bilbo,' said Gandalf, 'he is waiting for the same day, and  he 
line 46261=>knows what keeps you. And as for the passing of the days, it is now only May 
line 46262=>and high summer is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if 
line 46263=>an  age of the world had gone by,  yet to the trees and the grass it is less 
line 46264=>than a year since you set out.' 
line 46265=>     'Pippin,' said Frodo, 'didn't you say  that Gandalf was less close than 
line 46266=>of old? He was weary of his labours then, I think. Now he is recovering.' 
line 46267=>     And Gandalf said: 'Many  folk  like to know beforehand what is to be set 
line 46268=>on the table; but those who have laboured  to prepare the feast like to keep 
line 46269=>their secret;  for  wonder makes the words of  praise  louder.  And  Aragorn 
line 46270=>himself waits for a sign.' 
line 46271=>     There came a day when  Gandalf could not  be  found, and  the Companions 
line 46272=>
line 46273=>####-wondered what was going forward. But Gandalf took Aragorn  out from the 
line 46274=>City 
line 46275=>by night, and he brought him to the  southern feet  of Mount Mindolluin; and 
line 46276=>there they found a path made  in ages  past that few now dared to tread. For  
line 46277=>it led up on to the mountain to a high hallow where only the kings had  been 
line 46278=>wont to go. And they went up by steep ways,  until they came to a high field 
line 46279=>below  the  snows that clad the  lofty peaks, and it  looked down  over  the 
line 46280=>precipice that stood behind the  City. And standing there they  surveyed the 
line 46281=>lands, for the  morning  was come; and they saw the towers  of the  City far 
line 46282=>below  them  like white pencils touched by the sunlight, and all the Vale of 
line 46283=>Anduin was like a  garden, and  the  Mountains  of Shadow  were veiled in  a 
line 46284=>golden mist. Upon the one side their  sight reached  to the grey Emyn  Muil,  
line 46285=>and  the  glint of  Rauros was like a star twinkling far  off; and upon  the 
line 46286=>other  side they  saw  the River like  a ribbon  laid down to Pelargir,  and 
line 46287=>beyond that was a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the Sea. 
line 46288=>     And Gandalf said: 'This  is  your realm, and  the heart  of the greater  
line 46289=>realm that shall be. The Third Age of the world is ended, and the new age is 
line 46290=>begun; and it is your  task to order its beginning  and to preserve what may 
line 46291=>be preserved. For though much has been  saved, much must  now pass away; 
line 46292=>and 
line 46293=>the power  of the Three Rings also is ended. And all the lands that you see, 
line 46294=>and those that lie round about them, shall be dwellings of Men. For the time 
line 46295=>comes of the Dominion of Men, and the Elder Kindred shall fade or depart.' 
line 46296=>     'I  know it well, dear  friend,' said Aragorn; 'but I would still  have 
line 46297=>your counsel.' 
line 46298=>     'Not for long now,' said Gandalf. 'The Third Age  was my age. I was the 
line 46299=>Enemy of Sauron; and my work  is finished. I shall go soon. The  burden must  
line 46300=>lie now upon you and your kindred.' 
line 46301=>     'But I  shall die,' said Aragorn. 'For  I  am a mortal man, and  though 
line 46302=>being what I am and of the race of the West unmingled, I shall have life far 
line 46303=>longer than other  men,  yet that is but a little while;  and when those who 
line 46304=>are now in the wombs of women are  born and have grown old, I too shall grow 
line 46305=>old.  And who then shall govern Gondor and those who look to this City as to 
line 46306=>their queen,  if my  desire be  not  granted? The Tree in the Court  of  the 
line 46307=>Fountain is still withered and barren. When shall  I see a sign that it will 
line 46308=>ever be otherwise?' 
line 46309=>     'Turn your face from the  green world, and look where all seems  barren 
line 46310=>
line 46311=>####-and cold!' said Gandalf.  
line 46312=>     Then Aragorn  turned. and there was  a  stony  slope behind him running  
line 46313=>down from  the skirts of the snow; and as he looked he  was aware that alone 
line 46314=>there in the waste a growing thing stood. And he climbed to it, and saw that 
line 46315=>out of  the very edge  of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no  more than 
line 46316=>three  foot  high. Already it had  put forth young  leaves long and shapely, 
line 46317=>dark above and silver beneath,  and upon its slender crown it bore one small  
line 46318=>cluster of flowers whose white petals shone like the sunlit snow.  
line 46319=>     Then Aragorn cried:  'Yj! ut®vienyes! I  have found it!  Lo! here is  a  
line 46320=>scion  of the Eldest of Trees!  But how comes it here? For it  is not itself 
line 46321=>yet seven years old.' 
line 46322=>     And Gandalf coming  looked at it, and said: 'Verily this is a sapling of 
line 46323=>the line of  Nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling  of Galathilion,  and 
line 46324=>that a fruit of Telperion of  many names, Eldest of Trees. Who shall say how 
line 46325=>it comes here  in the appointed hour? But this is an ancient hallow, and ere 
line 46326=>the kings  failed or the Tree  withered in the court, a fruit must have been 
line 46327=>set here.  For it is said that, though the fruit of the Tree comes seldom to 
line 46328=>ripeness, yet the life within may then lie sleeping through many long years, 
line 46329=>and none can foretell the time in which it will awake. Remember this. For if 
line 46330=>ever  a fruit ripens,  it should  be planted, lest  the  line die out of the 
line 46331=>world. Here it has lain. hidden on the mountain, even as the race of Elendil 
line 46332=>lay hidden in the wastes of the North. Yet the line of Nimloth is older  far 
line 46333=>than your line, King Elessar.' 
line 46334=>     Then Aragorn laid his hand  gently to the sapling, and lo! it seemed to 
line 46335=>hold only lightly to the earth, and it was removed without hurt; and Aragorn 
line 46336=>bore it back  to  the Citadel. Then the withered tree was uprooted, but with 
line 46337=>reverence; and they did not burn it, but laid it  to rest in the silence  of 
line 46338=>Rath Dnnen. And Aragorn planted the new tree in the  court by the  fountain, 
line 46339=>and swiftly and gladly it began to grow; and when the month  of June entered 
line 46340=>in it was laden with blossom. 
line 46341=>     'The sign has been given,'  said Aragorn, 'and the day is not far off.' 
line 46342=>And he set watchmen upon the walls.  
line 46343=>     It was the day  before Midsummer  when messengers came from Amon D(n 
line 46344=>to 
line 46345=>the  City,  and  they said that there was a  riding of fair folk out of  the 
line 46346=>North,  and they drew near now to  the walls of the Pelennor. And  the  King 
line 46347=>said: 'At last they have come. Let all the City be made ready!' 
line 46348=>
line 46349=>####-     Upon the very Eve of Midsummer, when  the sky  was blue as sapphire and 
line 46350=>white stars opened in the East,  but the West was still  golden  and the air 
line 46351=>was  cool and  fragrant, the riders came down the North-way to the gates  of 
line 46352=>Minas Tirith. First rode Elrohir  and  Elladan with a  banner of silver, and 
line 46353=>then  came Glorfindel  and Erestor  and  all the household of Rivendell, and  
line 46354=>after them came the Lady Galadriel and Celeborn,  Lord of Lothlurien, riding 
line 46355=>upon white steeds and with  them many fair folk of their land,  grey-cloaked 
line 46356=>with  white  gems in their hair; and last came Master  Elrond, mighty  among 
line 46357=>Elves and Men, bearing the sceptre of Ann®minas,  and beside him upon a 
line 46358=>grey 
line 46359=>palfrey rode Arwen his daughter, Evenstar of her people. 
line 46360=>     And Frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening, with stars on 
line 46361=>her brow and a sweet fragrance about her,  was moved with  great wonder, and 
line 46362=>he said to Gandalf: 'At  last I  understand why we  have waited! This is the 
line 46363=>ending. Now not day only shall be beloved, but  night too shall be beautiful 
line 46364=>and blessed and all its fear pass away!' 
line 46365=>     Then  the  King welcomed  his  guests, and  they  alighted;  and Elrond 
line 46366=>surrendered  the sceptre, and  laid the hand of  his daughter in the hand of 
line 46367=>the King, and together they went up into  the  High City,  and a ll the stars 
line 46368=>flowered in the sky.  And  Aragorn the King Elessar wedded Arwen Undumiel 
line 46369=>in 
line 46370=>the City of the Kings upon the day of Midsummer, and  the tale of their long 
line 46371=>waiting and labours was come to fulfilment. 
line 46372=> 
line 46373=>
line 46374=>####- 
line 46375=>
line 46376=>Chapter 6. Many Partings 
line 46377=>
line 46378=> 
line 46379=> 
line 46380=>     When the days of rejoicing were over at last the Companions  thought of 
line 46381=>returning to their own homes.  And Frodo went to the  King as he was sitting 
line 46382=>with the Queen Arwen by  the fountain, and she sang a song of Valinor, while 
line 46383=>the Tree grew and blossomed. They welcomed Frodo  and rose to greet him; 
line 46384=>and 
line 46385=>Aragorn said: 
line 46386=>     'I  know what you have come to say, Frodo: you wish to  return to  your 
line 46387=>own  home. Well, dearest friend,  the tree grows  best  in the  land of  its 
line 46388=>sires; but  for  you in  all  the lands of the  West  there will  ever  be a  
line 46389=>welcome. And though your people have had little fame in the  legends  of the 
line 46390=>great, they will  now have  more renown than  any wide  realms that  are  no 
line 46391=>more.' 
line 46392=>     'It  is true that  I  wish to  go back to the Shire,' said Frodo.  'But 
line 46393=>first I must  go to Rivendell.  For  if there could be anything wanting in a  
line 46394=>time so  blessed,  I missed Bilbo;  and  I was  grieved when  among all  the 
line 46395=>household of Elrond I saw that he was not come.' 
line 46396=>     'Do  you wonder at that,  Ring-bearer?' said  Arwen.  'For you know the 
line 46397=>power  of that thing  which is now destroyed; and  all that was done by that 
line 46398=>power is now passing away. But your kinsman possessed this thing longer than 
line 46399=>you.  He is ancient in years now, according to his kind; and  he awaits you, 
line 46400=>for he will not again make any long journey save one.' 
line 46401=>     'Then I beg leave to depart soon,' said Frodo. 
line 46402=>     'In seven days we will go,' said Aragorn. 'For we  shall ride  with you  
line 46403=>far on the road, even as far as  the  country  of Rohan.  In three days  now 
line 46404=>Jomer will return hither to bear Thjoden back to rest  in  the Mark, and  we 
line 46405=>shall ride  with  him to honour  the fallen.  But now before  you go  I will 
line 46406=>confirm the words that Faramir spoke to you, and you are made free  for ever 
line 46407=>of the realm of Gondor; and  all your companions likewise. And if there were 
line 46408=>any gifts that I could give to match with  your deeds you  should have them;  
line 46409=>but whatever you  desire you  shall  take  with you, and  you shall ride  in 
line 46410=>honour and arrayed as princes of the land.' 
line 46411=>     But the  Queen  Arwen  said:  'A  gift I will give  you.  For I  am the 
line 46412=>daughter  of Elrond. I shall not  go  with  him now when  he departs to  the 
line 46413=>
line 46414=>####-Havens; for mine is the choice of L®thien, and as she so have I chosen, both 
line 46415=>the  sweet  and the bitter. But in  my stead you shall go, Ring-bearer, when 
line 46416=>the time  comes, and if you  then desire it. If your hurts grieve you  still 
line 46417=>and the memory of  your  burden is heavy, then  you may pass  into the West, 
line 46418=>until all your wounds and weariness  are hea led. But wear this now in memory 
line 46419=>of Elfstone and Evenstar with whom your life has been woven!' 
line 46420=>     And she took  a white gem like a star that lay upon her  breast hanging 
line 46421=>upon a silver chain,  and she  set the chain  about Frodo's neck.  'When the 
line 46422=>memory  of the  fear  and  the darkness troubles you,'  she said, 'this will 
line 46423=>bring you aid.' 
line 46424=>     In three days, as the King had said, Jomer  of Rohan came riding to the 
line 46425=>City, and with him came an  jored of the fairest knights  of the Mark. He was 
line 46426=>welcomed; and when they sat all  at table in Merethrond,  the  Great Hall of 
line 46427=>Feasts, he beheld the beauty of  the ladies that he  saw and was filled with 
line 46428=>great  wonder. And before  he went to his rest he sent for Gimli  the Dwarf, 
line 46429=>and he said to him: 'Gimli Gluin's son, have you your axe ready?' 
line 46430=>     'Nay,  lord,' said Gimli, 'but  I  can  speedily fetch it, if there  be 
line 46431=>need.' 
line 46432=>     'You  shall  judge,'  said  Jomer.  'For  there are  certain rash words 
line 46433=>concerning the Lady in the Golden  Wood that lie still between us. And now I 
line 46434=>have seen her with my eyes.' 
line 46435=>     'Well, lord,' said Gimli, 'and what say you now?' 
line 46436=>     'Alas!'  said Jomer. 'I will not say that she  is the fairest lady that 
line 46437=>lives.' 
line 46438=>     'Then I must go for my axe,' said Gimli. 
line 46439=>     'But first I will  plead this excuse,' said Jomer. 'Had  I seen  her in 
line 46440=>other company, I would have said all that you could wish. But now I will put 
line 46441=>Queen Arwen Evenstar first, and I  am ready to do battle on my own part with 
line 46442=>any who deny me. Shall I call for my sword?' 
line 46443=>     Then  Gimli bowed low.  'Nay, you are excused  for my  part, lord,'  he 
line 46444=>said. 'You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the Morning. And 
line 46445=>my heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever.' 
line 46446=>     At last  the day of departure came, and a  great and fair  company made 
line 46447=>ready to ride  north from the City. Then the kings of Gondor and Rohan  went 
line 46448=>to the Hallows and they came  to the tombs in Rath Dnnen, and they bore away 
line 46449=>King Thjoden upon  a golden  bier,  and passed through the City  in silence.  
line 46450=>Then they laid the bier upon a great wain with  Riders of Rohan all about it 
line 46451=>
line 46452=>####-and his banner borne before; and Merry being Thjoden's esquire rode upon the 
line 46453=>wain and kept the arms of the king. 
line 46454=>     For  the  other  Companions steeds  were furnished  according to  their 
line 46455=>stature; and Frodo and Samwise rode at Aragorn's side, and Gandalf rode upon 
line 46456=>Shadowfax, and Pippin rode with the knights of Gondor; and Legolas and 
line 46457=>Gimli 
line 46458=>as ever rode together upon Arod. 
line 46459=>     In that riding went  also Queen  Arwen, and Celeborn and Galadriel with 
line 46460=>their  folk,  and Elrond  and his sons; and the princes of Dol Amroth and of 
line 46461=>Ithilien, and many captains and knights. Never had any king of the Mark such 
line 46462=>company upon the road as went with Thjoden Thengel's  son to the land of his 
line 46463=>home. 
line 46464=>     Without haste and at peace they passed into Anurien,  and they came  to 
line 46465=>the  Grey  Wood under Amon  D(n; and  there they heard a sound  as  of drums 
line 46466=>beating in the hills, though no living thing could be seen. Then Aragorn let 
line 46467=>the trumpets be blown; and heralds cried: 
line 46468=>     'Behold  the King  Elessar is come! The Forest  of Dr®adan he  gives to 
line 46469=>Ghvn-buri-ghvn and to his folk, to be their own  for ever; and hereafter let 
line 46470=>no man enter it without their leave!' 
line 46471=>     Then the drums rolled loudly, and were silent. 
line 46472=>     At length after fifteen days of journey the wain of King Thjoden passed 
line 46473=>through the green  fields of Rohan and  came to Edoras;  and  there they all 
line 46474=>rested. The  Golden Hall  was arrayed  with fair hangings and it was  filled 
line 46475=>with light, and there was  held the highest feast that it had known since the 
line 46476=>days of its building. For after three days the Men  of the Mark prepared the 
line 46477=>funeral  of Thjoden; and  he was laid in a  house of stone with his arms and 
line 46478=>many  other  fair things that  he had possessed,  and over him was raised  a  
line 46479=>great mound, covered with green turves of grass and  of white evermind.  And 
line 46480=>now there were eight mounds on the east -side of the Barrowfield. 
line 46481=>     Then the Riders of the King's House  upon white horses rode round about 
line 46482=>the barrow and sang together a song of Thjoden Thengel's  son that  Gljowine 
line 46483=>his minstrel made,  and he made no  other song after. The slow voices of the 
line 46484=>Riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not  know the speech of that 
line 46485=>people; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of 
line 46486=>the Mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of the North and  
line 46487=>the voice of Eorl crying  above the battle upon the  Field of Celebrant; and 
line 46488=>the  tale  of  the kings rolled on, and the  horn  of Helm  was  loud in the 
line 46489=>
line 46490=>####-mountains, until the Darkness  came and King Thjoden arose  and rode through 
line 46491=>the Shadow  to  the fire,  and died in splendour, even as the Sun, returning 
line 46492=>beyond hope, gleamed upon Mindolluin in the morning. 
line 46493=>     Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising 
line 46494=>     he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing. 
line 46495=>     Hope he rekindled, and in hope ended; 
line 46496=>     over death, over dread, over doom lifted 
line 46497=>     out of loss, out of life, unto long glory. 
line 46498=>     But Merry stood at the foot of the green mound,  and he wept, and  when 
line 46499=>the song was ended he arose and cried: 
line 46500=>     'Thjoden King, Thjoden King!  Farewell! As a father you were to me. for  
line 46501=>a little while. Farewell!' 
line 46502=>     When the burial  was  over and the  weeping of  women was stilled,  and  
line 46503=>Thjoden was  left  at  last alone in his barrow, then folk gathered  to  the 
line 46504=>Golden Hall for the great feast and  put away sorrow;  for Thjoden had lived 
line 46505=>to full years  and ended in  honour no  less than the greatest of his sires.  
line 46506=>And when the time  came that in the  custom of the Mark they should drink to 
line 46507=>the memory of the kings, Jowyn  Lady of Rohan came  forth, golden as the sun 
line 46508=>and white as snow, and she bore a filled cup to Jomer. 
line 46509=>     Then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and  named all the names of the  
line 46510=>Lords of the Mark in their  order: Eorl the Young;  and Brego builder of the  
line 46511=>Hall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless;  and Frja, and  Frjawine, and 
line 46512=>Goldwine, and Djor, and Gram; and Helm who lay  hid in Helm's Deep when  
line 46513=>the 
line 46514=>Mark was overrun; and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that 
line 46515=>time the  line  was  broken,  and after came  the  mounds of the  east-side: 
line 46516=>Frjalaf,  Helm s sister -son, and  Ljofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine,  
line 46517=>and Fengel, and Thengel, and Thjoden the latest. And when Thjoden  was 
line 46518=>named 
line 46519=>Jomer drained the  cup. Then Jowyn bade those  that served to fill the cups, 
line 46520=>and all  there assembled rose  and  drank to the  new  king, crying:  'Hail, 
line 46521=>Jomer, King of the Mark!' 
line 46522=>     At the  last when the  feast drew to an end Jomer arose and  said: 'Now 
line 46523=>this is the funeral feast of Thjoden the King; but I will speak ere we go of 
line 46524=>tidings of joy,  for  he would not grudge that I should do so, since he  was 
line 46525=>ever a father of Jowyn my sister. Hear then all my guests, fair folk of many 
line 46526=>realms, such  as  have never before  been gathered  in  this  hall! Faramir, 
line 46527=>
line 46528=>####-Steward  of  Gondor, and Prince of  Ithilien, asks that  Jowyn Lady of Rohan 
line 46529=>should be his wife,  and she grants it full willing. Therefore they shall be 
line 46530=>trothplighted before you  all.' 
line 46531=>     And Faramir and Jowyn stood  forth and set hand in  hand; and all there 
line 46532=>drank to them  and were glad. 'Thus,'  said Jomer, 'is the friendship of the 
line 46533=>Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.' 
line 46534=>     'No niggard are you, Jomer,' said Aragorn, 'to give  thus to Gondor the 
line 46535=>fairest thing in your realm!' 
line 46536=>     Then Jowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and  she said: 'Wish  me joy,  
line 46537=>my liege-lord and healer!' 
line 46538=>     And he answered: 'I have wished  thee joy  ever since first I saw thee. 
line 46539=>It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.' 
line 46540=>     When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of King Jomer. 
line 46541=>Aragorn and his knights, and  the people  of Lurien  and of Rivendell,  made 
line 46542=>ready  to  ride;  but Faramir  and Imrahil  remained  at  Edoras; and  Arwen 
line 46543=>Evenstar remained also, and she said farewell  to her brethren. None saw her  
line 46544=>last meeting with Elrond  her father, for  they went up into the  hills  and 
line 46545=>there  spoke long together, and bitter was  their parting that should endure 
line 46546=>beyond the ends of the world. 
line 46547=>     At the last  before the guests set oat Jomer and  Jowyn came to  Merry, 
line 46548=>and  they said: 'Farewell now, Meriadoc of the  Shire  and Holdwine  of  the 
line 46549=>Mark! Ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to our welcome!' 
line 46550=>     And Jomer said: 'Kings of  old would  have laden you  with gifts that a  
line 46551=>wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of Mundburg; and yet  you 
line 46552=>will take  naught,  you say, but the  arms that  were given to you.  This  I 
line 46553=>suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is  worthy; but my sister begs you to 
line 46554=>receive this small thing, as a memorial of Dernhelm and of the horns  of the  
line 46555=>Mark at the coming of the morning.' 
line 46556=>     Then  Jowyn gave to Merry  an ancient horn, small but cunningly wrought 
line 46557=>all of fair silver with a baldric of green; and wrights had engraven upon it 
line 46558=>swift horsemen riding in  a  line  that  wound about it from the tip  to the 
line 46559=>mouth; and there were set runes of great virtue. 
line 46560=>     'This is  an  heirloom of  our house,' said Jowyn. 'It was made  by the 
line 46561=>Dwarves, and came from the hoard of Scatha the  Worm. Eorl the Young 
line 46562=>brought 
line 46563=>it from the North. He that blows it  at need shall set fear in the hearts of 
line 46564=>his enemies and joy in the hearts of  his friends, and they  shall hear  him 
line 46565=>
line 46566=>####-and come to him.' 
line 46567=>     Then Merry  took  the  horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed 
line 46568=>Jowyn's hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time. 
line 46569=>     Now the guests were  ready,  and  they drank the stirrup-cup, and  with 
line 46570=>great praise  and friendship they departed, and  came at  length  to  Helm's  
line 46571=>Deep, and there they rested two  days. Then Legolas  repaid  his  promise to 
line 46572=>Gimli and went with him to the  Glittering Caves;  and when they returned he 
line 46573=>was silent, and  would  say only that Gimli  alone could find fit  words  to 
line 46574=>speak of them. 'And never  before has  a Dwarf claimed a victory over an Elf 
line 46575=>in a contest of words,' said he. 'Now therefore let us go to Fangorn and set 
line 46576=>the score right!' 
line 46577=>     From  Deeping-coomb  they rode to Isengard,  and saw  how the Ents  had 
line 46578=>busied  themselves. All the stone-circle had been  thrown down and  removed, 
line 46579=>and  the land within was made into a garden  filled with orchards and trees,  
line 46580=>and a stream  ran through  it;  but in  the midst of all there was a lake of 
line 46581=>clear  water, and out of it  the  Tower  of  Orthanc  rose  still, tall  and 
line 46582=>impregnable, and its black rock was mirrored in the pool. 
line 46583=>     For a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of Isengard had 
line 46584=>stood, and there were now two tall trees like sentinels  a t the beginning of 
line 46585=>a green-bordered path that ran towards Orthanc; and they looked in wonder at 
line 46586=>the work that had been done, but no living thing could they see far or near. 
line 46587=>But presently they heard a voice calling hoom-hom, hoom-hom;  and there 
line 46588=>came 
line 46589=>Treebeard striding down the path to greet them with Quickbeam at his side. 
line 46590=>     'Welcome to the  Treegarth of Orthanc!' he said. 'I  knew that you were 
line 46591=>coming, but I was at work up the valley; there is much still to be done. But 
line 46592=>you  have  not been idle  either away in the south and the east, I hear; and 
line 46593=>all that I hear is good, very good.' Then Treebeard praised all their deeds,  
line 46594=>of which he seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked 
line 46595=>long at Gandalf. 
line 46596=>     'Well, come  now!' he said.  'You  have proved mightiest,  and all your 
line 46597=>labours have gone well.  Where now would you be  going? And why  do you 
line 46598=>come 
line 46599=>here?' 
line 46600=>     'To see how your work goes, my friend,' said Gandalf, 'and to thank you  
line 46601=>for your aid in all that has been achieved.' 
line 46602=>     'Hoom, well, that is fair enough,' said Treebeard; 'for to be sure Ents 
line 46603=>
line 46604=>####-have played  their  part. And  not  only in  dealing with that,  hoom,  that 
line 46605=>accursed tree-slayer that dwelt here. For there was a great inrush of those, 
line 46606=>burbrum,   those  evileyed  -  blackhanded  -  bowlegged  -  flinthearted  - 
line 46607=>clawfingered  - foulbellied  -  bloodthirsty,  morimaite -  sincahonda,  hoom, 
line 46608=>well, since  you are  hasty folk and their full name is as long as  years of 
line 46609=>torment, those vermin  of orcs; and they came  over  the River a nd down from 
line 46610=>the  North and all round the wood of  Laurelindurenan, which they could  not 
line 46611=>get into, thanks  to the Great ones who  are here.' He bowed to the Lord and 
line 46612=>Lady of Lurien. 
line 46613=>     'And these same foul creatures were more than  surprised to meet us  out 
line 46614=>on the Wold, for they had  not heard of us before; though that might be said 
line 46615=>also of better folk. And not many  will remember us, for not many escaped us 
line 46616=>alive, and the River had most of those. But it was well for you, for if they 
line 46617=>had  not met us,  then the king of the grassland would not have  ridden far, 
line 46618=>and if he had there would have been no home to return to.' 
line 46619=>     'We know it  well,' said Aragorn, 'and never  shall it be forgotten  in 
line 46620=>Minas Tirith or in Edoras.' 
line 46621=>     'Never is too long a word even for me,' said Treebeard. 'Not while your 
line 46622=>kingdoms last, you mean; but they will have to last long indeed to seem long  
line 46623=>to Ents.' 
line 46624=>     'The New Age begins,' said Gandalf, 'and in this age it may  well prove 
line 46625=>that the  kingdoms of Men shall outlast you, Fangor n my friend. But now come 
line 46626=>tell me: what of the task that I set you? How is Saruman? Is he not weary of 
line 46627=>Orthanc yet? For I do  not suppose that he will think you  have improved the 
line 46628=>view from his windows.' 
line 46629=>     Treebeard gave Gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, Merry thought. 
line 46630=>'Ah!'  he said.  'I thought you would come to  that. Weary of  Orthanc? Very 
line 46631=>weary  at last; but  not so weary of his tower as he  was weary of my voice. 
line 46632=>Hoom! I gave  him some long tales, or at least what might be thought long in 
line 46633=>your speech.' 
line 46634=>     'Then why  did he  stay  to  listen?  Did  you go into  Orthanc?' asked 
line 46635=>Gandalf. 
line 46636=>     'Hoom,  no, not  into Orthanc!'  said  Treebeard. 'But he came  to  his 
line 46637=>window and listened,  because he could  not get news in any  other  way, and 
line 46638=>though he hated the news, he was greedy to have it; and  I saw that he heard 
line 46639=>it all. But I added a great many things to the news that it was good for him 
line 46640=>to think of. He grew very weary. He always was hasty. That was his ruin.' 
line 46641=>
line 46642=>####-     'l  observe, my good  Fangorn,' said Gandalf,  'that with great care you  
line 46643=>say dwelt, was, grew. What about is? Is he dead?' 
line 46644=>     'No, not dead, so far as I know,' said Treebeard. 'But he is gone. Yes, 
line 46645=>he is gone seven days.  I let him go.  There  was little left of him when he 
line 46646=>crawl ed  out,  and as  for  that worm-creature of his,  he was  like  a pale 
line 46647=>shadow. Now do not tell me, Gandalf, that I promised to keep him safe; for I  
line 46648=>know it.  But things have changed since then.  And  I kept him until  he was 
line 46649=>safe, safe from doing any  mor e harm. You should know that above all  I hate 
line 46650=>the  caging of live things, and I will not keep even such creatures as these 
line 46651=>caged beyond great need. A snake without fangs may crawl where he will.' 
line 46652=>     'You may be right,'  said Gandalf; 'but this snake  had still one tooth 
line 46653=>left, I think. He had the poison of his voice, and I guess that he persuaded 
line 46654=>you, even you Treebeard,  knowing the soft spot in your heart.  Well,  he is 
line 46655=>gone, and there is no more to be said.  But the Tower  of  Orthanc now  goes 
line 46656=>back to  the King, to whom it belongs. Though maybe he will not need it.' 
line 46657=>     'That  will  be seen later,' said Aragorn. 'But I will give to Ents all 
line 46658=>this valley  to  do with as they will, so long  as  they  keep a watch  upon 
line 46659=>Orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave.' 
line 46660=>     'It is locked,' said Treebeard. 'I made Saruman lock it and give me the 
line 46661=>keys. Quickbeam has them.' 
line 46662=>     Quickbeam  bowed like a tree bending in the wind and  handed to Aragorn 
line 46663=>two great black keys of intricate shape, joined by a  ring of steel.  'Now I 
line 46664=>thank you once more,' said Aragorn, 'and I bid you farewell. May your forest 
line 46665=>grow again in peace. When  this valley is filled there  is room and to spare 
line 46666=>west of the mountains, where once you walked long ago.' 
line 46667=>     Treebeard's face became sad. 'Forests may  grow,' he  said.  'Woods may 
line 46668=>spread. But not Ents. There are no Entings.' 
line 46669=>     'Yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,' said Aragorn. 'Lands 
line 46670=>will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.' 
line 46671=>     But  Treebeard shook his head and said: 'It is far to go. And there are 
line 46672=>too  many Men there in these days. But I am forgetting  my manners! Will you  
line 46673=>stay here and rest a  while? And maybe there are  some that would be pleased 
line 46674=>to pass through Fangorn Forest and so shorten their road home?' He looked at 
line 46675=>Celeborn and Galadriel. 
line 46676=>     But  all  save Legolas said  that they  must  now take  their leave and 
line 46677=>depart, either south or west. 'Come, Gimli!' said Legolas. 'Now by Fangorn's 
line 46678=>leave I will visit the deep places of the Entwood and  see such trees as are 
line 46679=>
line 46680=>####-nowhere  else  to be found in Middle-earth. You  shall come with me and keep 
line 46681=>your word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in Mirkwood 
line 46682=>and beyond.' To this Gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed. 
line 46683=>     'Here  then  at last comes the ending of the Fellowship  of  the Ring,' 
line 46684=>said Aragorn. 'Yet I hope that ere long you will  return to my land with the 
line 46685=>help that you promised.' 
line 46686=>     'We will come, if our own lords allow it,' said Gimli. 'Well, farewell. 
line 46687=>my hobbits! You  should  come safe to your own homes now, and I shall not be 
line 46688=>kept  awake for fear  of your peril. We will send word when we may, and some 
line 46689=>of us  may yet meet at times; but I fear that we shall not all  be  gathered 
line 46690=>together ever again.' 
line 46691=>     Then Treebeard  said farewell to  each of  them  in turn, and  he bowed 
line 46692=>three times slowly and with great reverence to Celeborn and  Galadriel.  'It 
line 46693=>is long,  long since we  met by stock  or by  stone, A  vanimar,  vanimblion 
line 46694=>nostari!' he said. 'It is sad that we should meet only  thus at  the ending. 
line 46695=>For the world is changing: I  feel it in the  water, I feel it in the earth, 
line 46696=>and I smell it in the air. I do not think we shall meet again.' 
line 46697=>     And Celeborn said: 'I do not know, Eldest.' But Galadriel sa id: 'Not in 
line 46698=>Middle-earth, nor  until the lands  that lie  under the wave  are lifted  up 
line 46699=>again. Then in the  willow-meads  of  Tasarinan we may meet in  the  Spring. 
line 46700=>Farewell!' 
line 46701=>     Last of all Merry and Pippin said good-bye to the  old Ent, and he grew 
line 46702=>gayer as he looked at  them. 'Well, my merry folk,' he said, 'will you drink  
line 46703=>another draught with me before you go?' 
line 46704=>     'Indeed we  will,' they said,  and he took them aside into the shade of 
line 46705=>one  of the trees, and there they saw that  a  great stone jar had been set. 
line 46706=>And Treebeard  filled  three bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange 
line 46707=>eyes looking at them over the  rim of his bowl. 'Take  care take  care!'  he 
line 46708=>said. 'For you have already grown  since I saw you last.'  And  they laughed 
line 46709=>and drained their bowls.  
line 46710=>     'Well, good-bye!' he said. 'And don't forget  that if you hear any news 
line 46711=>of the Entwives in your land, you  will send word to me.'  Then he waved his 
line 46712=>great hands to all the company and went off into the trees.  
line 46713=> 
line 46714=>     The  travellers now  rode with more  speed,  and  they made  their  way 
line 46715=>towards  the Gap of Rohan; and Aragorn took leave  of them at last  close to 
line 46716=>that  very place where  Pippin had looked  into  the Stone  of  Orthanc. The 
line 46717=>
line 46718=>####-Hobbits were grieved at this parting; for Aragorn had never failed  them and 
line 46719=>he had been their guide through many perils.  
line 46720=>     'I wish  we  could have a Stone that  we could see all our friends in,' 
line 46721=>said Pippin, 'and that we could speak to them from far away!' 
line 46722=>     'Only  one  now remains  that you could use ,'  answered Aragorn for you  
line 46723=>would not wish to see what the Stone of Minas Tirith would show you. But the 
line 46724=>Palantnr of Orthanc the King will keep, to see what is passing in his realm, 
line 46725=>and what his servants are doing. For do not forget, Peregrin Took, that  you  
line 46726=>are a knight  of Gondor, and I do not release you from your service. You are 
line 46727=>going now on leave, but I may recall you.  And remember, dear friends of the 
line 46728=>Shire, that my realm  lies  also in the  North, and I shall  come there  one 
line 46729=>day.' 
line 46730=>     Then Aragorn took leave of Celeborn and Galadriel; and the Lady said to 
line 46731=>him: 'Elfstone,  through  darkness  you have come to your hope, and have now 
line 46732=>all your desire. Use well the days!' 
line 46733=>     But  Celeborn  said: 'Kinsman,  farewell! May  your doom be  other than 
line 46734=>mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!' 
line 46735=>     With that they parted,  and  it was then the  time  of sunset; and when 
line 46736=>after  a  while  they turned and looked back,  they saw the King of the West 
line 46737=>sitting upon his horse with his knights about him; and the falling Sun shone 
line 46738=>upon them and made all  their harness to gleam like red gold,  and the white 
line 46739=>mantle of Aragorn  was turned  to a flame. Then Aragorn took the green stone 
line 46740=>and held it up, and there came a green fire from his hand. 
line 46741=>     Soon the dwindling company, following the  Isen,  turned west  and rode 
line 46742=>through  the  Gap  into  the  waste  lands  beyond,  and  then  they  turned 
line 46743=>northwards, and passed over the borders of Dunland. The Dunlendings fled and 
line 46744=>hid themselves, for they were afraid of Elv ish Folk,  though few indeed ever  
line 46745=>came to  their country; but the travellers  did not heed them, for they were 
line 46746=>still a great company and were well provided  with all that they needed; and  
line 46747=>they went  on  their way at their leisure, setting  up their tents when they 
line 46748=>would. 
line 46749=>     On the  sixth day  since their  parting  from the  King  they journeyed 
line 46750=>through  a wood  climbing  down from the  hills  at the  feet  of the  Misty 
line 46751=>Mountains that now marched on their right hand. As they came out  again into 
line 46752=>the open country at sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff, and 
line 46753=>he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty white, and at his heels went another  
line 46754=>beggar, slouching and whining. 
line 46755=>
line 46756=>####-     'Well Saruman!' said Gandalf. 'Where are you going?' 
line 46757=>     'What is  that to  you?' he answered. 'Will you  still  order my goings,  
line 46758=>and are you not content with my ruin?' 
line 46759=>     'You know the  answers,' said Gandalf: 'no and no. But in  any case the 
line 46760=>time of my labours now draws to an end. The King has taken on the burden. If 
line 46761=>you had waited at Orthanc, you would have seen  him, and he would have 
line 46762=>shown 
line 46763=>you wisdom and mercy.' 
line 46764=>     'Then all the A more reason  to have left sooner,' said Saruman; 'for I 
line 46765=>desire  neither  of  him.  Indeed if  you wish for  an answer  to your first 
line 46766=>question, I am seeking a way out of his realm.' 
line 46767=>     'Then once  more you are going the wrong way,' said Gandalf, 'and I see 
line 46768=>no hope in your journey.  But  will  you scorn our help?  For we offer it to 
line 46769=>you.' 
line 46770=>     'To  me?' said  Saruman. 'Nay, pray do not smile  at me! I prefer  your 
line 46771=>frowns. And as  for the Lady here, I do not trust her:  she always hated me, 
line 46772=>and schemed  for your part. I do not doubt that she has brought you this way 
line 46773=>to have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty. Had  I been warned of your 
line 46774=>pursuit, I would have denied you the pleasure.' 
line 46775=>     'Saruman,' said Galadriel, 'we have other errands  and other cares that 
line 46776=>seem  to us more  urgent  than  hunting  for  you. Say rather  that  you are 
line 46777=>overtaken by good fortune; for now you have a last chance.' 
line 46778=>     'If it be truly the last, I am glad,'  said  Saruman;  'for I shall  be 
line 46779=>spared the  trouble of  refusing it  again. All  my hopes are ruined,  but I 
line 46780=>would not share yours. If you have any.' 
line 46781=>     For  a  moment his eyes kindled. 'Go!'  he said. 'I did   not spend long 
line 46782=>study on these matters for naught. You have  doomed yourselves, and you 
line 46783=>know 
line 46784=>it. And it will afford me  some comfort as I wander to think that you pulled 
line 46785=>down your own house  when you destroyed  mine. And now, what  ship will 
line 46786=>bear 
line 46787=>you back across so wide a sea?' he mocked. 'It will be a grey ship, and full 
line 46788=>of ghosts.' He laughed, but his voice was cracked and hideous.  
line 46789=>     'Get up, you  idiot!' he shouted to the other  beggar, who had sat down 
line 46790=>on the ground; and  he struck him with his staff. 'Turn about! If these fine 
line 46791=>folk are going our way, then we will  take another. Get on, or I'll give you  
line 46792=>no crust for your supper!' 
line 46793=>
line 46794=>####-     The beggar  turned and slouched past  whimpering: 'Poor old Grnma! Poor  
line 46795=>old Grnma!  Always beaten and cursed. How  I hate him!  I wish I could leave 
line 46796=>him!' 
line 46797=>     'Then leave him!' said Gandalf.  
line 46798=>     But Wormtongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at 
line 46799=>Gandalf, and then shuffled quickly past behind Saruman. As the wretched pair 
line 46800=>passed  by the  company they came  to the hobbits, and Saruman  stopped  and 
line 46801=>stared at them; but they looked at him with pity. 
line 46802=>     'So you have  come  to  gloat too, have you, my urchins?' he said. 'You  
line 46803=>don't care what a beggar lacks, do you? For  you have all you want, food and 
line 46804=>fine clothes, and the best weed for your pipes. Oh yes, I know! I know where 
line 46805=>it comes from. You would not give a pipeful to a beggar, would you?' 
line 46806=>     'I would, if I had any,' said Frodo. 
line 46807=>     'You can have what I have  got left,' said Merry,  'if you will wa it  a  
line 46808=>moment.' He got down and searched  in  the bag at his saddle. Then he handed 
line 46809=>to Saruman a leather pouch.  'Take what there is,' he said. 'You are welcome 
line 46810=>to it; it came from the flotsam of Isengard.' 
line 46811=>     'Mine, mine, yes and dearly bought!' cried  Saruman,  clutching  at the 
line 46812=>pouch. 'This is only a repayment in token; for you took more, I'll be bound. 
line 46813=>Still,  a beggar must  be grateful,  if a thief returns him even a morsel of 
line 46814=>his own. Well, it  will serve you right  when you  come  home,  if  you find 
line 46815=>things  less good in  the Southfarthing than you  would like. Long  may your  
line 46816=>land be short of leaf!' 
line 46817=>     'Thank you!' said Merry. 'In that case I will have my pouch back, which 
line 46818=>is not yours and has journeyed  far with me.  Wrap the weed in a rag of your  
line 46819=>own.' 
line 46820=>     'One thief  deserves  another,' said  Saruman,  and turned his back  on 
line 46821=>Merry, and kicked Wormtongue, and went away towards the wood. 
line 46822=>     'Well, I  like that!' said Pippin. 'Thief indeed! What of our claim for  
line 46823=>waylaying, wounding, and orc-dragging us through Rohan?' 
line 46824=>     'Ah!' said Sam. 'And bought he said. How,  I  wonder? And I didn't like 
line 46825=>the sound of what he said about the Southfarthing. It's time we got back.' 
line 46826=>     'I'm sure it is,' said Frodo. 'But  we can't go  any quicker, if we are 
line 46827=>to see Bilbo. I am going to Rivendell first, whatever happens.' 
line 46828=>     'Yes, I  think  you  had better do that,' said Gandalf. 'But  alas  for  
line 46829=>Saruman! I fear nothing more can be made of him. He has withered altogether. 
line 46830=>All the same, I am not sure that  Treebea rd  is right: I  fancy he could  do 
line 46831=>
line 46832=>####-some mischief still in a small mean way.' 
line 46833=>     Next day they went on into  northern Dunland, where  no men now  dwelt, 
line 46834=>though  it was  a green and pleasant country. September came  in with golden 
line 46835=>days  and  silver  nights, and they  rode  at  ease  until  they reached the 
line 46836=>Swanfleet  river, and  found the  old ford, east of the  falls where it went 
line 46837=>down suddenly into the lowlands. Far to the west in a haze lay the meres and 
line 46838=>eyots through which it wound its way to the Greyflood: there countless swans 
line 46839=>housed in a land of reeds. 
line 46840=>     So  they  passed into  Eregion,  and at last  a  fair  morning  dawned, 
line 46841=>shimmering above gleaming mists;  and looking from their camp on a  low hill 
line 46842=>the travellers saw away in the east the Sun catching three peaks that thrust  
line 46843=>up into the sky through floating clouds: Caradhras, Celebdil, and Fanuidhol.  
line 46844=>They were near to the Gates of Moria. 
line 46845=>     Here  now  for  seven  days they tarried, for the  time was at hand for  
line 46846=>another parting which  they  were loth to make.  Soon Celeborn and Galadriel 
line 46847=>and their folk would turn eastward, and so pass by the Redhorn Gate and down 
line 46848=>the  Dimrill Stair to the  Silverlode  and to  their own  country.  They had 
line 46849=>journeyed  thus far  by the  west -ways, for  they had  much  to speak of with 
line 46850=>Elrond and with Gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their 
line 46851=>friends.  Often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep  they would sit 
line 46852=>together under  the stars, recalling  the ages that were gone and  all their 
line 46853=>joys  a nd  labours in the world, or holding council, concerning  the days to 
line 46854=>come. If any wanderer had chanced  to  pass,  little would he  have seen  or  
line 46855=>heard, and it would have seemed to him only that he saw grey figures, carved 
line 46856=>in stone, memorials of forgotten  things now  lost in  unpeopled  lands. For 
line 46857=>they did  not move or speak with mouth, looking from mind  to mind; and only 
line 46858=>their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro. 
line 46859=>     But at length all was said, and they parted again for a  while, until it 
line 46860=>was time for  the Three Rings to  pass away. Quickly fading into  the stones 
line 46861=>and  the  shadows  the  grey-cloaked  people  of  Lurien  rode  towards  the 
line 46862=>mountains;  and  those  who  were going  to  Rivendell sat  on the hill  and 
line 46863=>watched,   until there came out of the gathering mist a flash; and  then they 
line 46864=>saw no more. Frodo knew that Galadriel  had held aloft her ring  in token of 
line 46865=>farewell. 
line 46866=>     Sam turned away and sighed: 'I wish I was going back to Lurien!' 
line 46867=>     At last one  evening  they came over  the  high moors, suddenly  as  to 
line 46868=>travellers it always seemed,  to  the brink of the  deep valley of Rivendell 
line 46869=>
line 46870=>####-and saw far below the lamps  shining  in Elrond's house. And they went  down 
line 46871=>and crossed the bridge and came to  the doors,  and all  the house was filled 
line 46872=>with light and song for joy at Elrond's homecoming. 
line 46873=>     First of  all, before  they  had  eaten or  washed  or even shed  their 
line 46874=>cloaks, the hobbits went in search of Bilbo. They found him all alone in his 
line 46875=>little room. It was littered with papers and pens and pencils; but Bilbo was 
line 46876=>sitting in  a  chair before  a small  bright fire. He looked  very old,  but 
line 46877=>peaceful, and sleepy. 
line 46878=>     He  opened his eyes and  looked up as they came in. 'Hullo, hullo!'  he 
line 46879=>said. 'So you've  come back? And  tomorrow's my birthday, too. How clever of 
line 46880=>you! Do you know,  I shall  be one hundred and twenty-nine? And  in one year 
line 46881=>more, if I am spared, I shall equal the Old Took. I should like to beat him; 
line 46882=>but we shall see.' 
line 46883=>     After the celebration  of  Bilbo's birthday  the four hobbits stayed in 
line 46884=>Rivendell for some days, and they sat much with  their old friend, who spent 
line 46885=>most  of his time  now in his room,  except at meals. For these he was still 
line 46886=>very punctual as a rule, and he seldom failed to wake  up in t ime  for them. 
line 46887=>Sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of 
line 46888=>their journeys and adventures. At first he pretended to take some notes; but 
line 46889=>he often fell asleep; and when he  woke  he would  say:  'How splendid!  How 
line 46890=>wonderful!  But where were we?'  Then they went  on with  the story from the 
line 46891=>point where he had begun to nod. 
line 46892=>     The only  part that  seemed really to rouse him and  hold his attention 
line 46893=>was the account of  the crowning and marriage of Aragorn. 'I was  invited to  
line 46894=>the wedding of course,' he said. 'And I have  waited for it long enough. But 
line 46895=>somehow, when it came  to it,  I found I had so much to do here; and packing 
line 46896=>is such a bother.' 
line 46897=>     When  nearly a fortnight had passed Frodo  looked out of his window and 
line 46898=>saw that  there had been a frost  in the night, and  the  cobwebs were  like 
line 46899=>white  nets.  Then  suddenly he knew that he must go,  and  say  good-bye to 
line 46900=>Bilbo. The weather  was still calm  and fair, after one  of the  most lovely 
line 46901=>summers that people could remember; but October had  come, and it must 
line 46902=>break 
line 46903=>soon  and begin to rain and blow again. And there was still a very long  way 
line 46904=>to go. Yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him. He 
line 46905=>had  a feeling  that  it  was time he went back to the Shire. Sam shared it. 
line 46906=>Only the night before he had said: 
line 46907=>
line 46908=>####-     'Well, Mr. Frodo, we've been far and seen a deal, and yet I don't think  
line 46909=>we've found a better place than this. There's  something of everything here, 
line 46910=>if  you understand me:  the Shire and the Golden  Wood and  Gondor and kings' 
line 46911=>houses and  inns and  meadows and mountains all mixed.  And  yet, somehow, 
line 46912=>I 
line 46913=>feel we ought to be going soon. I'm worried about my gaffer, to tell you the 
line 46914=>truth.' 
line 46915=>     'Yes,  something  of  everything,  Sam,  except  the  Sea,'   Frodo  had 
line 46916=>answered; and he repeated it now to himself: 'Except the Sea.' 
line 46917=>     That  day  Frodo spoke to Elrond, and  it was  agreed  that they should 
line 46918=>leave the next morning. To their delight Gandalf said: 'I think I shall come 
line 46919=>too. At least as far as Bree. I want to see Butterbur.' 
line 46920=>     In  the evening  they went to say good-bye to Bilbo. 'Well, if you must  
line 46921=>go, you must,' he said.  'I am sorry.  I shall miss you.  It is nice just to 
line 46922=>know that  you are about the  place. But I am getting very sleepy.' Then  he 
line 46923=>gave Frodo his mithril-coat  and Sting, forgetting that he had  already done 
line 46924=>so;  and  he gave him  also three books of lore that he had made  at various 
line 46925=>times,  written  in  his spidery hand,  and labelled  on  their  red  backs: 
line 46926=>Translations from the Elvish, by B.B. 
line 46927=>     To Sam he gave a little bag of gold. 'Almost the last drop of the Smaug 
line 46928=>vintage,' he  said.  'May come in  useful,  if you think of getting married, 
line 46929=>Sam.' Sam blushed. 
line 46930=>     'I have nothing  much to give to you young fellows,' he said   to  Merry 
line 46931=>and Pippin, 'except  good advice.'  And when he had given them a fair sample 
line 46932=>of  this, he added a last item in Shire-fashion:  'Don't let your heads  get 
line 46933=>too big for  your hats! But  if you don't  finish growing  up soon,  you are 
line 46934=>going to find hats and clothes expensive.' 
line 46935=>     'But if you want to  beat  the Old Took,' said Pippin, 'I don't see why 
line 46936=>we shouldn't try and beat the Bullroarer.' 
line 46937=>     Bilbo laughed, and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with 
line 46938=>pearl mouth-pieces and bound with fine-wrought silver.  'Think of me when you  
line 46939=>smoke them!' he said. 'The  Elves made them for  me, but I don't smoke now.' 
line 46940=>And then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little; and when he woke 
line 46941=>up again he said: 'Now where were we? Yes, of course, g iving presents. Which 
line 46942=>reminds me: what's become of my ring, Frodo, that you took away?' 
line 46943=>     'I have lost it, Bilbo dear,' said Frodo. 'I got rid of it, you know.' 
line 46944=>     'What a  pity!' said  Bilbo. 'I should have liked to see  it again. But 
line 46945=>
line 46946=>####-no, how silly  of me! That's what you went for, wasn't it: to get rid of it?  
line 46947=>But it is all so confusing, for such a lot of  other things seem to have got 
line 46948=>mixed  up  with it: Aragorn's affairs, and the White Council and Gondor, and 
line 46949=>the Horsemen, and Southrons, and oliphaunts - did you really see one, Sam? - 
line 46950=>and caves and towers and golden trees, and goodness knows what besides. 
line 46951=>     'I  evidently came  back  by much too straight a  road from my trip.  I 
line 46952=>think Gandalf might have shown  me round  a bit. But then the  auction  would 
line 46953=>have been  over  before I got back,  and I should have had even more trouble 
line 46954=>than I  did. Anyway  it's  too  late  now; and really I think it's much more 
line 46955=>comfortable to sit  here and hear about it all.  The fire's  very cosy here, 
line 46956=>and the food's very good, and there are Elves when you want  them. What more 
line 46957=>could one want?  
line 46958=>     The Road goes ever on and on  
line 46959=>     Out from the door where it began. 
line 46960=>     Now far ahead the Road has gone, 
line 46961=>     Let others follow it who can! 
line 46962=>     Let them a journey new begin, 
line 46963=>     But I at last with weary feet 
line 46964=>     Will turn towards the lighted inn, 
line 46965=>     My evening-rest and sleep to meet.' 
line 46966=>     And  as Bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and 
line 46967=>he slept soundly. 
line 46968=>     The evening deepened in the room,  and the  firelight  burned brighter; 
line 46969=>and they looked at Bilbo  as he slept and saw that his face was smiling. For  
line 46970=>some time they sat in silence; and then Sam  looking round  at  the room and 
line 46971=>the shadows flickering on the walls, said softly: 
line 46972=>     'I don't think, Mr. Frodo, that he's done much writing while we've been 
line 46973=>away. He won't ever write our story now.' 
line 46974=>     At that  Bilbo opened an eye, almost as if he had heard. Then he roused 
line 46975=>himself. 'You see, I am getting so  sleepy,' he said. 'And when I have  time 
line 46976=>to write, I only really like writing poetry. I wonder, Frodo my dear fellow,  
line 46977=>if you  would very much mind  tidying things up a bit before you go? Collect 
line 46978=>all my notes and  papers, and my diary too, and  take them with you, if  you  
line 46979=>will. You see, I haven't much time for the selection and the arrangement and 
line 46980=>all that.  Get Sam to help, and when you've knocked things into  shape, come 
line 46981=>back, and I'll run over it. I won't be too critical.' 
line 46982=>     'Of course I'll do it!' said Frodo. 'And of course I'll come back soon: 
line 46983=>
line 46984=>####-it won't be dangerous any  more. There  is a real king now and he  will soon 
line 46985=>put the roads in order.' 
line 46986=>     'Thank  you, my dear fellow!' said Bilbo. 'That really is a  very great 
line 46987=>relief to my mind.' And with that he fell fast asleep again. 
line 46988=>     The next day Gandalf and the hobbits took leave  of Bilbo  in his room, 
line 46989=>for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to Elrond  and all 
line 46990=>his household. 
line 46991=>     As Frodo stood upon  the threshold, Elrond  wished him  a fair journey, 
line 46992=>and blessed him, and he said: 
line 46993=>     'I think,  Frodo, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you  
line 46994=>come  very soon. For  about this time of the year, when the  leaves are gold 
line 46995=>before they fall, look for Bilbo in  the woods of the Shire. I shall be with 
line 46996=>him.' 
line 46997=>     These wor ds no one else heard, and Frodo kept them to himself.  
line 46998=>

line 47001=>
line 47002=>Chapter 7. Homeward Bound 
line 47003=>
line 47004=> 
line 47005=> 
line 47006=>     At last  the  hobbits had  their  faces  turned towards home. They were 
line 47007=>eager now to see the  Shire again; but at first they  rode  only slowly, for  
line 47008=>Frodo had been il l at  ease.  When they came to the  Ford of Bruinen, he had 
line 47009=>halted, and seemed loth  to ride into the stream; and they  noted that for a  
line 47010=>while his eyes appeared not to see them or things about him. All that day he  
line 47011=>was silent. It was the sixth of October. 
line 47012=>     'Are you in  pain,  Frodo?' said Gandalf quietly  as he rode by Frodo's 
line 47013=>side. 
line 47014=>     'Well, yes I am,' said Frodo. 'It is my shoulder. The  wound aches, and 
line 47015=>the memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was a year ago today.' 
line 47016=>     'Alas!  there  are  some  wounds  that  cannot be  wholly  cured,' said 
line 47017=>Gandalf. 
line 47018=>     'I  fear it may be so with  mine,'  said Frodo. 'There is no real going 
line 47019=>back. Though I may come to the Shire, it will not seem the same; for I shall 
line 47020=>not  be the same.  I am  wounded  with  knife, sting,  and tooth, and a long 
line 47021=>burden. Where shall I find rest?' 
line 47022=>     Gandalf did not answer. 
line 47023=>     By the end of the next day  the pain and  unease had passed, and  Frodo 
line 47024=>was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day 
line 47025=>before. After that the journey went well,  and the days went quickly by; for  
line 47026=>they rode  at leisure,  and often they lingered in the fair  woodlands where 
line 47027=>the leaves were red  and yellow  in the  autumn  sun. At length they came to  
line 47028=>Weathertop; and  it was then drawing  towards  evening and the shadow of the 
line 47029=>hill lay  dark  on the road. Then Frodo begged them to  hasten, and he would  
line 47030=>not look towards the hill,  but rode through its shadow with  head bowed and 
line 47031=>cloak drawn close about him. That night the weather changed, and a wind came 
line 47032=>from the  West laden with rain, and it blew loud and  chill,  and the yellow 
line 47033=>leaves whirled like birds in the air. When they came to the Chetwood already 
line 47034=>the boughs were almost bare, and a great  curtain  of rain  veiled Bree Hill 
line 47035=>from their sight. 
line 47036=>     So it was that near the end of a wild and wet  evening in the last days 
line 47037=>of October the  five travellers rode up  the  climbing road and came  to the 
line 47038=>South-gate of Bree.  It was locked fast; and the rain  blew in  their faces,  
line 47039=>
line 47040=>####-and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying  by, and their hearts sank  
line 47041=>a little, for they had expected more welcome. 
line 47042=>     When they had called many times, at last  the Gate-keeper came out, and 
line 47043=>they saw that  he  carried a great cudgel. He looked at them  with  fear and 
line 47044=>suspicion; but  when he saw that Gandalf  was there, and that his companions 
line 47045=>were hobbits,  in spite of their strange gear, then he brightened and wished 
line 47046=>them welcome. 
line 47047=>     'Come in!' he said,  unlocking  the  gate. 'We  won't stay for news out 
line 47048=>here  in the  cold  and the wet, a ruffianly evening. But old Barley will no 
line 47049=>doubt give you a welcome at The Pony, and there you'll hear all there is  to 
line 47050=>hear.' 
line 47051=>     'And  there  you'll hear  later all  that  we say,  and  more,' laughed 
line 47052=>Gandalf. 'How is Harry? ' 
line 47053=>     The Gate-keeper scowled. 'Gone,' he said. 'But you'd best ask Barliman. 
line 47054=>Good evening!' 
line 47055=>     'Good  evening  to  you!' they said, and passed through; and then  they 
line 47056=>noticed  that  behind the  hedge at  the road-side a long low  hut had  been 
line 47057=>built, and a  number of  men had come out and were staring at  them over the 
line 47058=>fence. When they  came  to  Bill Ferny's house they saw that the hedge there 
line 47059=>was tattered and unkempt, and the windows were all boarded up. 
line 47060=>     'Do you think you killed him with that apple, Sam?' said Pippin. 
line 47061=>     'I'm not so hopeful, Mr. Pippin,' said Sam. 'But  I'd like to know what 
line 47062=>became  of that poor  pony. He's  been on my mind many a time and the wolves 
line 47063=>howling and all.' 
line 47064=>     At last they  came  to  The Prancing  Pony,  and that at  least  looked 
line 47065=>outwardly unchanged;  and  there were lights behind the red curtains  in the 
line 47066=>lower windows. They rang the bell, and Nob came to the door, and opened it a  
line 47067=>crack and peeped through; and when  he saw  them standing under the  lamp he 
line 47068=>gave a cr y of surprise. 
line 47069=>     'Mr. Butterbur! Master!' he shouted. 'They've come back!' 
line 47070=>     'Oh  have  they? I'll learn them,' came  Butterbur's voice, and out  he 
line 47071=>came with a rush, and he  had a club in his hand.  But when he  saw who they 
line 47072=>were he stopped short, a nd the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and 
line 47073=>delight. 
line 47074=>     'Nob,  you woolly-pated  ninny!'  he cried. 'Can't you give old friends 
line 47075=>their names? You shouldn't go scaring  me like that, with times as they are. 
line 47076=>
line 47077=>####-Well, well! And where have you come from? I never expected to see any of 
line 47078=>you 
line 47079=>folk again, and that's a fact: going  off into the Wild with  that  Strider, 
line 47080=>and all those Black Men about. But I'm right glad to  see you, and none more 
line 47081=>than Gandalf. Come in! Come  in!  The same rooms as  - before? They're free. 
line 47082=>Indeed  most rooms  are empty  these  days, as I'll  not  hide from you, for  
line 47083=>you'll find it out soon enough. And I'll see what can be done  about supper, 
line 47084=>as soon as may be; but I'm short-handed at  present. Hey, Nob you slowcoach!  
line 47085=>Tell Bob! Ah, but there I'm forgetting, Bob's gone: goes home to his folk at 
line 47086=>nightfall now. Well, take the guests' ponies to the stables, Nob! And you'll 
line 47087=>be  taking your horse to his  stable yourself Gandalf; I don't doubt. A fine 
line 47088=>beast, as  I  said  when  I  first  set eyes  on  him.  Well, come in!  Make 
line 47089=>yourselves at home!' 
line 47090=>     Mr. Butterbur had at  any rate not  changed his manner  of talking, and 
line 47091=>still  seemed to live in his old breathless bustle. And yet there was hardly 
line 47092=>anybody about, and all  was  quiet; from the  Common  Room  there came a 
line 47093=>low 
line 47094=>murmur of no more than two or three voices. And seen  closer in the light of 
line 47095=>two  candles that he lit and carried before them the landlord's face  looked 
line 47096=>rather wrinkled and careworn. 
line 47097=>     He led them down the passage to the parlour that they  had used on that 
line 47098=>strange  night more  than  a  year  ago;  and  they  followed him,  a little 
line 47099=>disquieted,  for it seemed  plain  to them  that old Barliman was putting  a  
line 47100=>brave  face on some trouble.  Things were not what they  had been.  But they 
line 47101=>said nothing, and waited. 
line 47102=>     As  they expected Mr. Butterbur came to the parlour after supper to see 
line 47103=>if  all had been to their liking. As indeed  it had: no change for the worse 
line 47104=>had  yet come upon the beer  or the victuals at The Pony at any rate. 'Now I 
line 47105=>won't  make  so  bold as  to  suggest you should  come  to the  Common  Room 
line 47106=>tonight,' said Butterbur. 'You'll be tired; and there isn't many folk  there 
line 47107=>this evening, anyway. But if you could spare me half an  hour before you  go 
line 47108=>to  your beds, I would dearly like to have some talk with you, quiet-like by 
line 47109=>ourselves.' 
line 47110=>     'That  is  just what we should like,  too,'  said Gandalf. 'We  are not 
line 47111=>tired.  We have been taking things easy.  We were wet, cold and hungry,  but 
line 47112=>all  that you  have  cured.  Come, sit down!  And if you have any pipe-weed, 
line 47113=>we'll bless you.' 
line 47114=>
line 47115=>####-     'Well, if you'd called  for anything else, I'd have been happier,' said 
line 47116=>Butterbur. 'That's just a thing that we're  short of, seeing how  we've only 
line 47117=>got  what we  grow ourselves,  and  that's not enough. There's none to be had 
line 47118=>from the Shire these days. But I'll do what I can.' 
line 47119=>     When he came back he brought them enough to last them for a day or two, 
line 47120=>a wad of uncut leaf.  'Southlinch,' he said, 'and the best  we have; but not 
line 47121=>the match of Southfarthing,  as I've always said though I'm all  for Bree in 
line 47122=>most matters, begging your pardon.' 
line 47123=>     They put him  in a large chair by the wood-fire, and Gandalf sat on the 
line 47124=>other side of the hearth, and the  hobbits  in low chairs between them;  and 
line 47125=>then they talked for many times half an hour, and exchanged all such news as 
line 47126=>Mr.  Butterbur wished to hear or give. Most of the  things which they had to  
line 47127=>tell were a mere  wonder and bewilderment to  their host, and far beyond his 
line 47128=>vision; and  they  brought forth few  comments other than: 'You  don't  say; 
line 47129=>often repeated in defiance of the evidence of Mr. Butterbur's own ears. 'You  
line 47130=>don't say, Mr. Baggins, or is it Mr. Underhill? I'm getting so mixed up. You  
line 47131=>don't  say,  Master  Gandalf! Well I never!  Who'd  have  thought it in  our 
line 47132=>times!' 
line 47133=>     But he did say much on  his  own account. Things were far from well, he 
line 47134=>would say. Business was  not even fair, it was downright bad.  'No one comes 
line 47135=>nigh Bree  now from Outside,'  he said. 'And the inside  folks, they stay at 
line 47136=>home mostly and keep their doors barred. It all comes of those newcomers and 
line 47137=>gangrels that began coming up the Greenway  last year,  as you may remember; 
line 47138=>but  more came later. Some were just poor bodies running away from  trouble; 
line 47139=>but most were bad men, full o' thievery and  mischief. And there was trouble 
line 47140=>right here  in Bree, bad trouble. Why, we had a real set-to, and there  were 
line 47141=>some folk killed, killed dead! If you'll believe me.' 
line 47142=>     'I will indeed,' said Gandalf. 'How many?' 
line 47143=>     'Three  and two,' said  Butterbur,  referring to the big  folk  and the 
line 47144=>little. 'There was poor  Mat Heathertoes, and  Rowlie Appledore,  and little 
line 47145=>Tom Pickthorn from over the Hill; and  Willie Banks from up-away, and one of 
line 47146=>the Underhills from Staddle: all good fellows, and they're missed. And Harry 
line 47147=>Goatleaf that used to be on the West -gate, and that Bill Ferny, they came in 
line 47148=>on the strangers' side, and they've gone off  with them; and it's my  belief 
line 47149=>they let them in. On the night of the  fight, I  mean. And that was after we 
line 47150=>showed them the gates and  pushed them out: before the year's end, that was; 
line 47151=>and the fight was early in the New Year, after the heavy snow we had. 
line 47152=>
line 47153=>####-     'And now they're gone for robbers and live outside, hiding in the woods 
line 47154=>beyond Archet, and out  in the wilds north-away. It's like a  bit of the bad 
line 47155=>old  times tales tell of, I say. It  isn't safe  on the road and nobody goes 
line 47156=>far, and folk lock up  early. We have to keep watchers all round  the  fence 
line 47157=>and put a lot of men on the gates at nights.' 
line 47158=>     'Well, no one troubled us,' said Pippin, 'and we came along slowly, and 
line 47159=>kept no watch. We thought we'd left all trouble behind us.' 
line 47160=>     'Ah, that you haven't, Master,  more's the pity,'  said Butterbur. 'But 
line 47161=>it's  no wonder they left  you a lone. They wouldn't go for  armed folk, with 
line 47162=>swords and helmets and  shields  and all. Make them think twice, that would. 
line 47163=>And I must say it put me aback a bit when I saw you.' 
line 47164=>     Then the hobbits suddenly realized  that people had looked at them with 
line 47165=>amazement  not out of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their 
line 47166=>gear.  They  themselves  had  become  so  used to warfare and  to  riding in 
line 47167=>well-arrayed  companies  that they had quite  forgotten that the bright mail 
line 47168=>peeping from  under their cloaks, and the helms of Gondor and the Mark,  and 
line 47169=>the  fair devices  on  their  shields,  would seem  outlandish in  their own 
line 47170=>country. And Gandalf, too, was now  riding on his tall grey  horse, all clad 
line 47171=>in white with a great mantle of blue and silver over all, and the long sword 
line 47172=>Glamdring at his side. 
line 47173=>     Gandalf  laughed. 'Well,  well,'  he  said, 'if they are afraid of just 
line 47174=>five of us, then we have met worse enemies on our travels. But  at any  rate 
line 47175=>they will give you peace at night while we stay.' 
line 47176=>     'How long will that be?' said Butterbur.  'I'll  not deny we  should be 
line 47177=>glad to have you about for a bit. You see, we're not used to  such troubles; 
line 47178=>and  the  Rangers have all gone  away,  folk tell  me.  I don't  think we've 
line 47179=>rightly understood  till  now what  they did for us. For there's  been worse 
line 47180=>than robbers about.  Wolves  were howling round  the fences last winter. And 
line 47181=>there's  dark shapes in the woods, dreadful  things that it makes the  blood 
line 47182=>run cold to think of. It's been very disturbing, if you  understand me.' 
line 47183=>     'I expect it has,' said Gandalf. 'Nearly all  lands have been disturbed 
line 47184=>these days, very disturbed. But cheer up,  Barliman!  You  have been  on the 
line 47185=>edge  of very great troubles, and I  am only glad to hear that  you have not 
line 47186=>been  deeper in.  But  better times are  coming. Maybe,  better than any you  
line 47187=>remember. The Rangers have returned. We came back with them.  And there is 
line 47188=>a 
line 47189=>king again, Barliman. He will soon be turning his mind this way. 
line 47190=>
line 47191=>####-     'Then the Greenway will  be opened again , and his  messengers will come 
line 47192=>north,  and  there will  be comings and  goings, and the evil things will be 
line 47193=>driven out of  the waste-lands. Indeed the  waste in  time will be  waste no 
line 47194=>longer,  and  there   will  be  people  and  fields  where  once  ther e  was 
line 47195=>wilderness.' 
line 47196=>     Mr. Butterbur shook his head. 'If there's a few decent respectable folk  
line 47197=>on the roads, that  won't do no harm,' he said. 'But  we  don't want no more 
line 47198=>rabble and ruffians. And  we don't want no outsiders at Bree, nor  near Bree 
line 47199=>at all. We want to be let alone.  I  don't want a  whole  crowd o' strangers 
line 47200=>camping here and settling there and tearing up the wild country.' 
line 47201=>     'You will be let  alone, Barliman,' said Gandalf. 'There is room enough 
line 47202=>for realms between Isen and Greyflood, or  along the shore lands south of the  
line 47203=>Brandywine, without any one living within many days' ride of  Bree. And many 
line 47204=>folk used to dwell away north, a hundred miles or more from here, at the far  
line 47205=>end of the Greenway: on the North Downs or by Lake Evendim.' 
line 47206=>     'Up away by Deadmen's Dike?' said Butterbur, looking even more dubious.  
line 47207=>'That's haunted land, they say. None but a robber would go there.' 
line 47208=>     'The Rangers go  there,' said Gandalf.  'Deadmen's Dike, you say. So it 
line 47209=>has  been called for long years;  but its right  name, Barliman, is  Fornost  
line 47210=>Erain, Norbury of the Kings. And the King will come there again one day; and 
line 47211=>then you'll have some fair folk riding through.' 
line 47212=>     'Well,  that sounds more hopeful, I'll  allow,' said Butterbur. 'And it 
line 47213=>will be good for  business, no doubt. So long as he lets Bree alone.' 
line 47214=>     'He will,' said Gandalf. 'He knows it and loves it.' 
line 47215=>     'Does he now?' said Butterbur looking puzzled. 'Though I'm sure I don't 
line 47216=>know  why  he  should, sitting  in his  big  chair up in his  great   castle, 
line 47217=>hundreds  of miles away. And drinking wine out of a  golden cup, I shouldn't 
line 47218=>wonder.  What's  The Pony to him, or mugs  o'  beer? Not  but what my beer's 
line 47219=>good, Gandalf. It's been uncommon good, since you came in the autumn of last  
line 47220=>year and put a good word on it. And that's been a comfort in trouble, I will 
line 47221=>say.' 
line 47222=>     'Ah!' said Sam. 'But he says your beer is always good.' 
line 47223=>     'He says?' 
line 47224=>     'Of course he does. He's Strider. The chief of the Rangers. Haven't you  
line 47225=>got that into your head yet?' 
line 47226=>     It went in at last, and  Butterbur's face was  a study in  wonder.  The 
line 47227=>eyes in his broad face grew round, and his mouth opened wide, and he gasped. 
line 47228=>
line 47229=>####-'Strider!' he exclaimed when he  got back his breath.  'Him with a crown and 
line 47230=>all and a golden cup! Well, what are we coming to?' 
line 47231=>     'Better times, for Bree at any rate,' said Gandalf.  
line 47232=>     'I hope so, I'm sure,' said Butterbur. 'Well, this  has been the nicest  
line 47233=>chat I've  had  in  a month of  Mondays. And  I'll not deny that I'll  sleep 
line 47234=>easier  tonight and with a lighter heart. You've given  me a powerful lot to 
line 47235=>think over, but  I'll put that off until tomorrow. I'm  for bed, and I've no 
line 47236=>doubt  you'll be glad  of your beds too. Hey, Nob!' he called, going to  the 
line 47237=>door.  'Nob, you slowcoach!' 
line 47238=>     'Now!' he said to himself, slapping his  forehead. 'Now what  does that 
line 47239=>remind me of?' 
line 47240=>     'Not  another letter  you've forgotten. I hope,  Mr.  Butterbur?'  said 
line 47241=>Merry. 
line 47242=>     'Now, now, Mr.  Brandybuck, don't go reminding me of  that! But  there,  
line 47243=>you've  broken my  thought. Now where was I? Nob,  stables, ah! that was it. 
line 47244=>I've something that  belongs to  you.  If you recollect Bill  Ferny  and the 
line 47245=>horsethieving: his pony as you bought,  well,  it's  here. Come  back all of 
line 47246=>itself, it did. But where it had been to you know better than me. It was  as 
line 47247=>shaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes-rail, but it  was alive. Nob's 
line 47248=>looked after it.' 
line 47249=>     'What! My Bill?' cried Sam. 'Well, I was born lucky, whatever my gaffer  
line 47250=>may say. There's another  wish come true! Where is he?' Sam  would not go to 
line 47251=>bed until he had visited Bill in his stable. 
line 47252=>     The travellers stayed in Bree all the next day, and Mr. Butterbur could 
line 47253=>not complain of his  business next evening at any  rate. Curiosity  overcame  
line 47254=>all fears,  and his house was  crowded.  For a while  out of politeness  the 
line 47255=>hobbits  visited the Common  Room in the evening  and  answered a  good 
line 47256=>many 
line 47257=>questions. Bree memories being retentive,  Frodo was  asked many times if he 
line 47258=>had written his book. 
line 47259=>     'Not yet,' he answered. 'I am going home now to put my notes in order.' 
line 47260=>He promised to deal  with the amazing events at Bree, and so  give a bit  of 
line 47261=>interest to  a book that appeared likely to  treat mostly of  the remote and 
line 47262=>less important affairs 'away south'.  
line 47263=>     Then  one of  the  younger folk called for  a song. But at that a  hush 
line 47264=>fell,  and he was frowned  down,  and the  call  was not repeated. Evidently 
line 47265=>there was no wish for any uncanny events in the Common Room again. 
line 47266=>
line 47267=>####-     No trouble by day, nor  any sound by night, disturbed the peace of Bree 
line 47268=>while the travellers remained there; but the next morning they got up early, 
line 47269=>for  as the  weather  was still rainy they wished to reach the  Shire before 
line 47270=>night, and it was a long ride. The Bree folk were  all out  to see them off,  
line 47271=>and were in merrier mood than they had  been  for a year; and  those who had 
line 47272=>not seen the  strangers in all  their gear before gaped with wonder at them: 
line 47273=>at Gandalf with his white beard,  and  the light that  seemed to  gleam from 
line 47274=>him, as if his  blue mantle was on ly a  cloud over sunshine; and at the four 
line 47275=>hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost  forgotten tales. Even those 
line 47276=>who had laughed at all the talk about the King began to think there might be 
line 47277=>some truth in it. 
line 47278=>     'Well, good luck on your road,  and good luck to your home-coming! said 
line 47279=>Mr. Butterbur. 'I  should have warned you before that  all's not well in the 
line 47280=>Shire neither, if what we  hear is true.  Funny goings on, they say. But one 
line 47281=>thing drives out another, and I was full of my own troubles. But i f I may be 
line 47282=>so  bold, you've come back  changed from your travels, and you look now like 
line 47283=>folk as  can deal with troubles  out of hand. I don't  doubt you'll soon set 
line 47284=>all to rights. Good  luck to you! And the  oftener you  come back the better  
line 47285=>I'll be pleased.' 
line 47286=>     They wished  him  farewell  and  rode  away,  and  passed  through  the 
line 47287=>West-gate and on  towards  the  Shire. Bill the  pony was with them, and  as 
line 47288=>before he  had a  good deal of  baggage, but he trotted along beside Sam and 
line 47289=>seemed well content. 
line 47290=>     'I wonder what old Barliman was hinting at,' said Frodo. 
line 47291=>     'I can guess some of it,' said Sam gloomily. 'What I saw in the Mirror: 
line 47292=>trees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the Row.  I ought to 
line 47293=>have hurried back quicker.' 
line 47294=>     'And something's wrong  with the Southfarthing evidently,'  said Merry. 
line 47295=>'There's a general shortage of pipe-weed.' 
line 47296=>     'Whatever it  is,' said Pippin, 'Lotho will be at the bottom of it: you  
line 47297=>can be sure of that.' 
line 47298=>     'Deep in,  but not at the bottom,' said Gandalf.  'You  have  forgotten 
line 47299=>Saruman. He began to take an interest in the Shire before Mordor did.' 
line 47300=>     'Well,  we've  got you  with us,' said Merry,  'so things  will soon be 
line 47301=>cleared up.' 
line 47302=>     'I am with you at  present,' said Gandalf, 'but soon I  shall not be. I 
line 47303=>am not coming to the Shire. You must  settle its affairs yourselves; that is 
line 47304=>
line 47305=>####-what  you have been trained for. Do you not yet understand? My time is over: 
line 47306=>it is no longer my  task to set things to rights, nor to help folk to do so. 
line 47307=>And  as for you ,  my dear friends, you will need no  help. You are  grown up 
line 47308=>now. Grown indeed very high; among the  great you are,  and I have no longer  
line 47309=>any fear at all for any of you. 
line 47310=>     'But if you would know, I am turning aside soon.  I  am going to have a  
line 47311=>long talk with Bombadil: such a talk as I have not had in all my time. He is 
line 47312=>a moss-gatherer, and I have been a  stone doomed to rolling. But  my rolling 
line 47313=>days are ending, and now we shall have much to say to one another.' 
line 47314=>     In a little while  they came to the point on the East  Road  where they 
line 47315=>had taken  leave of  Bombadil; and  they hoped and  half expected to see him 
line 47316=>standing there to greet them as they went by. But there was no sign  of him; 
line 47317=>and  there was  a grey mist on the Barrow-downs southwards, and  a deep veil 
line 47318=>over the Old Forest far away. 
line 47319=>     They halted and Frodo looked south wistfully. 'I should dearly  like to 
line 47320=>see the old fellow again,' he said. 'I wonder how he is getting on?' 
line 47321=>     'As well as ever, you may be sure,' said Gandalf. 'Quite untroubled and 
line 47322=>I  should guess, not much interested in anything  that we have done or seen, 
line 47323=>unless perhaps in our visits to the Ents. There may be a time  later for you  
line 47324=>to go and see him. But if I were you, I should press on now for home, or you  
line 47325=>will not come to the Brandywine Bridge before the gates are locked.' 
line 47326=>     'But there aren't any  gates,' said  Merry, 'not  on the Road; you know 
line 47327=>that quite well.  There's  the  Buckland Gate, of course; but they'll let me 
line 47328=>through that at any time.' 
line 47329=>     'There  weren't any  gates,  you mean,'  said Gandalf. 'I think you will 
line 47330=>find some  now. And  you might have  more trouble even  at the Buckland Gate 
line 47331=>than you think. But you'll! manage all right. Good -bye dear friends! Not for  
line 47332=>the last time, not yet. Good-bye!' 
line 47333=>     He turned Shadowfax off the  Road, and the great horse leaped the green 
line 47334=>dike that here ran beside  it;  and then at a cry from Gandalf he  was gone, 
line 47335=>racing towards the Barrow-downs like a wind from the North. 
line 47336=>     'Well here we are, just the four of us that started out together,' said 
line 47337=>Merry. 'We have left all the rest behind, one after another. It seems almost  
line 47338=>like a dream that has slowly faded.' 
line 47339=>     'Not to  me,'  said  Frodo. 'To me it  feels  more  like falling asleep 
line 47340=>again.' 
line 47341=> 
line 47342=>
line 47343=>####- 
line 47344=>
line 47345=>Chapter 8. The Scouring of the Shire 
line 47346=>
line 47347=> 
line 47348=> 
line 47349=>     It was after nightfall when, wet and tired, the travellers came at last  
line 47350=>to  the Brandywine, and  they found  the way  barred. At  either  end of the 
line 47351=>Bridge there was a great  spiked gate;  and on the further side of the river  
line 47352=>they could see that some new houses had been built: two-storeyed with narrow 
line 47353=>straight-sided   windows,  bare   and   dimly  lit,  all  very   gloomy  and 
line 47354=>un-Shirelike. 
line 47355=>     They  hammered on  the outer gate and called, but there was at first no  
line 47356=>answer;  and then to their  surprise someone blew a horn, and  the lights in 
line 47357=>the windows went out. A voice shouted in the dark: 
line 47358=>     'Who's that?  Be off! You  can't come in: Can't you read the notice: No 
line 47359=>admittance between sundown and sunrise?' 
line 47360=>     'Of  course we can't read the notice  in the  dark.' Sam shouted  back. 
line 47361=>'And if hobbits of the Shire are to be  kept out in the wet on  a night like 
line 47362=>this, I'll tear down your notice when I find it.' 
line 47363=>     At that a  window slammed, and a crowd  of hobbits with lanterns poured  
line 47364=>out of the house on the  left. They opened the  further gate, and some  came 
line 47365=>over the bridge. When they saw the travellers they seemed frightened. 
line 47366=>     'Come along!' said Merry, recognizing one of the hobbits. 'If you don't 
line 47367=>know me, Hob Hayward, you ought to. I am Merry Brandybuck, and I should 
line 47368=>like 
line 47369=>to know what  all this is  about,  and  what a Bucklander  like you is doing 
line 47370=>here. You used to be on the Hay Gate.' 
line 47371=>     'Bless  me!  It's Master Merry, to  be sure,  and all  dressed  up  for  
line 47372=>fighting!'  said  old Hob. 'Why,  they  said you was  dead! Lost in  the Old 
line 47373=>Forest by all accounts. I'm pleased to see you alive after all!' 
line 47374=>     'Then  stop gaping  at  me  through the  bars, and open the gate!' said 
line 47375=>Merry. 
line 47376=>     'I'm sorry, Master Merry, but we have orders.' 
line 47377=>     'Whose orders?' 
line 47378=>     'The Chief's up at Bag End.' 
line 47379=>     'Chief? Chief? Do you mean Mr. Lotho?' said Frodo. 
line 47380=>     'I suppose  so,  Mr.  Baggins;  but  we have  to say  just  "the Chief" 
line 47381=>nowadays.' 
line 47382=>
line 47383=>####-     'Do you indeed!'  said  Frodo. 'Well,  I am  glad he  has  dropped  the 
line 47384=>Baggins at any  rate. But  it is evidently high  time that the  family dealt 
line 47385=>with him and put him in his place.' 
line 47386=>     A  hush fell  on the hobbits  beyond the  gate. 'It  won't do  no  good 
line 47387=>talking that  way,' said one. 'He'll  get to hear  of it. And if you make so 
line 47388=>much noise, you'll wake the Chief's Big Man.' 
line 47389=>     'We shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him,' said Merry. 'If 
line 47390=>you mean that your precious Chief has  been hiring ruffians out of the wild, 
line 47391=>then we've not come back too  soon.' He sprang from his pony, and seeing the 
line 47392=>notice in  the light of the lanterns, he  tore it down and threw it over the 
line 47393=>gate. The  hobbits  backed  away and  made no move  to open  it.  'Come  on, 
line 47394=>Pippin!' said Merry. 'Two is enough.' 
line 47395=>     Merry and Pippin  c limbed the gate, and the hobbits fled.  Another horn 
line 47396=>sounded. Out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure  appeared 
line 47397=>against a light in the doorway. 
line 47398=>     'What's all this,' he snarled as he  came  forward. 'Gate-breaking? You  
line 47399=>clear out, or I'l l break your filthy little necks!' Then he  stopped, for he 
line 47400=>had caught the gleam of swords. 
line 47401=>     'Bill Ferny,' said Merry, 'if you don't open that gate in ten  seconds,  
line 47402=>you'll regret it. I shall set steel  to you, if you don't obey. And when you  
line 47403=>have opened the gates you will go  through  them and never return. You are a 
line 47404=>ruffian and a highway-robber.' 
line 47405=>     Bill  Ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it. 'Give me 
line 47406=>the key!' said Merry. But  the ruffian flung it  at his head and then darted 
line 47407=>out into the darkness. As he  passed the ponies one of them let fly with his 
line 47408=>heels  and just caught him as he ran. He went off with a yelp into the night 
line 47409=>and was never heard of again. 
line 47410=>     'Neat work, Bill,' said Sam, meaning the pony. 
line 47411=>     'So much for your  Big Man,' said Merry. 'We'll see the Chief later. In 
line 47412=>the meantime we want a lodging for the night, and as you seem to have pulled 
line 47413=>down the Bridge Inn and built  this dismal place instead, you'll have to put 
line 47414=>us up.' 
line 47415=>     'I am sorry, Mr. Merry,' said Hob, 'but it isn't allowed.' 
line 47416=>     'What isn't allowed?' 
line 47417=>     Taking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food, and  all that, said 
line 47418=>Hob. 
line 47419=>     'What's the  matter  with the place?'  said Merry. 'Has it  been a  bad 
line 47420=>
line 47421=>####-year, or what? I thought it had been a fine summer and harvest.' 
line 47422=>     'Well no, the year's been good enough,'  said  Hob. 'We grows a lot  of 
line 47423=>food,  but  we  don't  rightly  know what  becomes  of  it.  It's all  these 
line 47424=>"gatherers" and "sharers", I reckon, going round counting and measuring  and 
line 47425=>taking off to storage. They do more gathering than sharing, and we never see 
line 47426=>most of the stuff again.' 
line 47427=>     'Oh  come!' said  Pippin yawning.  'This  is all too  tiresome  for  me 
line 47428=>tonight.  We've  got food in our bags.  Just give  us a room to lie down in. 
line 47429=>It'll be better than many places I have seen.' 
line 47430=>     The hobbits at the gate still seemed ill  at  ease, evidently some rule 
line 47431=>or other was being broken;  but there was no gainsaying four such  masterful 
line 47432=>travellers, all armed, and two of them uncommonly  large and strong-looking. 
line 47433=>Frodo ordered the gates to be locked again. There was some sense at any rate 
line 47434=>in  keeping  a  guard,  while  ruffians  were  still about.  Then  the  four 
line 47435=>companions   went  into  the  hobbit  guard-house  and  made  themselves  as 
line 47436=>comfortable as they  could. It was a bare and ugly place, with a mean little 
line 47437=>grate that would not allow a good fire. In the upper  rooms were little rows 
line 47438=>of  hard  beds, and on every wall  there was  a notice and a list  of Rules. 
line 47439=>Pippin tore them down. There was no beer and very little food, but with what 
line 47440=>the travellers brought and shared out they all made a  fair meal; and Pippin 
line 47441=>broke Rule 4 by putting most of next day's allowance of wood on the fire. 
line 47442=>     'Well now,  what  about a  smoke,  while  you tell  us  what  has  been 
line 47443=>happening in the Shire?' he said. 
line 47444=>     'There isn't  no pipe-weed  now,' said  Hob; 'at  least  only  for  the 
line 47445=>Chief's  men. All the stocks seem to have gone. We do hear that waggon-loads 
line 47446=>of  it went away down the  old road out of the Southfarthing, over Sarn Ford 
line 47447=>way. That would  be the end  o' last year, after you left.  But it  had been 
line 47448=>going away quietly before that, in a small way. That Lotho--' 
line 47449=>     'Now you  shut up, Hob Hayward!' cried several of the others. 'You know 
line 47450=>talk o' that sor t isn't allowed. The Chief will hear of it, and we'll all be 
line 47451=>in trouble.' 
line 47452=>     'He wouldn't hear naught, if some of you here weren't sneaks,' rejoined 
line 47453=>Hob hotly. 
line 47454=>     'All right, all right!' said Sam. "That's quite enough. I don't want to 
line 47455=>hear no more. No welcome, no beer, no smoke, and a lot of rules and orc-talk 
line 47456=>instead.  I  hoped  to have a rest, but I can see there's work  and  trouble 
line 47457=>ahead. Let's sleep and forget it till morning!' 
line 47458=>
line 47459=>####-     The new  'Chief' evidently had  means of getting news. It  was  a  good 
line 47460=>forty miles from  the Bridge to Bag End,  but someone made the journey  in a 
line 47461=>hurry. So Frodo and his friends soon discovered. 
line 47462=>     They had not made any definite plans, but  had vaguely thought of going  
line 47463=>down to Crickhollow together first, and resting there a bit. But now, seeing 
line 47464=>what things  were like, they decided to go straight to Hobbiton. So the next 
line 47465=>day they  set out  along  the Road and jogged  along  steadily. The wind had 
line 47466=>dropped but the sky was grey. The land looked rather sad and forlorn; bu t it 
line 47467=>was after all the first of  November and the fag-end of Autumn. Still  there 
line 47468=>seemed  an unusual  amount of burning  going  on, and  smoke rose  from many 
line 47469=>points  round  about.  A great cloud of  it  was  going up  far  away in the 
line 47470=>direction of the Woody End. 
line 47471=>     As evening fell they were  drawing near to  Frogmorton, a village right 
line 47472=>on the Road, about  twenty -two  miles  from the Bridge. There  they meant to 
line 47473=>stay  the night; The Floating Log at  Frogmorton was a good inn. But as they  
line 47474=>came to the  east  end of the village they met a barrier with  a large  board 
line 47475=>saying NO ROAD; and behind it stood a large band of Shirriffs with staves in 
line 47476=>their hands  and  feathers in their caps,  looking both important and rather  
line 47477=>scared. 
line 47478=>     'What's all this?' said Frodo, feeling inclined to laugh. 
line 47479=>     This is  what it is, Mr. Baggins, said  the leader  of the Shirriffs, a  
line 47480=>two-feather hobbit: 'You're arrested for  Gate-breaking,  and  Tearing up of 
line 47481=>Rules,  and  Assaulting  Gate-keepers,  and  Trespassing,  and  Sleeping  in 
line 47482=>Shire-buildings without Leave, and Bribing Guards with Food.' 
line 47483=>     'And what else?' said Frodo. 
line 47484=>     'That'll do to go on with,' said the Shirriff-leader. 
line 47485=>     'I  can add some more, if  you like it,' said Sam. 'Calling your  Chief 
line 47486=>Names, Wishing to punch his Pimply Face, and Thinking you  Shirriffs look  a  
line 47487=>lot of Tom-fools.' 
line 47488=>     'There now, Mister, that'll do.  It's the Chief's orders that you're to 
line 47489=>come  along quiet. We're going to  take you to Bywater and hand  you over to 
line 47490=>the Chief's Men; and when he deals with your case you can have your say. But 
line 47491=>if  you don't want  to  stay in the  Lockholes any longer than you  need,  I 
line 47492=>should cut the say short, if I was you.' 
line 47493=>     To  the  discomfiture  of  the Shirriffs  Frodo  and his companions all 
line 47494=>roared with laughter.  'Don't  be absurd!' said Frodo.  'I am  going where I 
line 47495=>please, and in my own time. I happen to be going to Bag End on business, but 
line 47496=>
line 47497=>####-if you insist on going too, well that is your affair.' 
line 47498=>     'Very  well, Mr. Baggins,' said the  leader, pushing the barrier aside. 
line 47499=>'But don't forget I've arrested you.' 
line 47500=>     'I won't,'  said Frodo. 'Never.  But  I may forgive  you. Now I am  not 
line 47501=>going any  further today, so if you'll kindly escort me to The Floating Log, 
line 47502=>I'll be obliged.' 
line 47503=>     'I   can't  do   that,  Mr.  Baggins.  The  inn's   closed.  There's  a  
line 47504=>Shirriff-house at the far end of the village. I'll take you there. ' 
line 47505=>     'All right,' said Frodo. 'Go on and we'll follow.' 
line 47506=>     Sam had been looking the Shirriffs up and down and had spotted one that 
line 47507=>he knew.  'Hey, come here  Robin Smallburrow!' he called.  'I want a word with 
line 47508=>you.' 
line 47509=>     With a sheepish glance at his leader, who looked  wrathful but did  not  
line 47510=>dare to interfere, Shirriff Smallburrow fell back and walked beside Sam, who 
line 47511=>got down off his pony. 
line 47512=>     'Look here, Cock -robin!' said  Sam. 'You're Hobbiton-bred and ought  to 
line 47513=>have more sense,  coming a -waylaying Mr. Frodo and all.  And what's all this 
line 47514=>about the inn being closed?' 
line 47515=>     'They're all closed,' said Robin.  'The  Chief  doesn't hold with beer. 
line 47516=>Leastways  that is how it started. But now I reckon it's his Men that has it 
line 47517=>all.  And he  doesn't  hold with folk moving about; so if they  will or they 
line 47518=>must, then they has to go to the Shirriff-house and explain their business.' 
line 47519=>     'You  ought to   be ashamed of  yourself having anything to do with such 
line 47520=>nonsense,' said Sam. 'You used to like the inside of an inn better than  the 
line 47521=>outside yourself. You were always popping in, on duty or off.' 
line 47522=>     'And so I would be still,  Sam,  if I  could. But don't be  hard on me. 
line 47523=>What  can I  do? You know  how I went for a Shirriff seven years ago, before 
line 47524=>any of this began. Gave me a chance of walking round the  country and seeing 
line 47525=>folk, and hearing the news,  and knowing where the  good beer was.  But  now 
line 47526=>it's different.' 
line 47527=>     'But you can give it  up,  stop Shirriffing, if it has  stopped being a  
line 47528=>respectable job,' said Sam. 
line 47529=>     'We're not allowed to,' said Robin. 
line 47530=>     'If  I hear  not allowed much oftener,' said  Sam, 'I'm  going  to  get 
line 47531=>angry.' 
line 47532=>     'Can't say as I'd be sorry to see  it,'  said Robin lowering his voice. 
line 47533=>'If we  all got angry together something might be done. But  it's these Men, 
line 47534=>
line 47535=>####-Sam, the Chief's Men. He sends them round everywhere, and if any of us small 
line 47536=>folk stand  up for our rights, they drag him off to the Lockholes. They took  
line 47537=>old Flourdumpling, old Will Whitfoot the Mayor,  first,  and they've taken a  
line 47538=>lot more. Lately it's been getting worse. Often they beat 'em now.' 
line 47539=>     'Then  why do you do their work far them?' said Sam  angrily. 'Who sent 
line 47540=>you to Frogmorton?' 
line 47541=>     'No one did. We stay  here in the big  Shirriff-house. We're the  First 
line 47542=>Eastfarthing Troop now. There's hundreds of Shirriffs all told and they want  
line 47543=>more, with  all these new rules. Most of them  are in it against their will, 
line 47544=>but not all. Even in  the Shire there are some as like  minding other folk's 
line 47545=>business and talking big. And there's worse than  that: there's a  few as do 
line 47546=>spy-work for the Chief and his Men.' 
line 47547=>     'Ah! So that's how you had news of us, is it?' 
line 47548=>     'That's right. We  aren't allowed to send by it  now, but they use  the 
line 47549=>old Quick Post service,  and keep  special runners at  different points. One 
line 47550=>came in  from  Whitfurrows  last  night with a "secret message", and another  
line 47551=>took it on from  here. And a message came back this afternoon saying you was 
line 47552=>to be  arrested and taken to Bywater, not direct to the Lockholes. The Chief 
line 47553=>wants to see you at once, evidently.' 
line 47554=>     'He won't be so eager when Mr. Frodo has finished with him,' said Sam. 
line 47555=>     The Shirriff-house at Frogmorton was as bad as the Bridge-house. It had 
line 47556=>only one storey,  but it  had the  same narrow windows, and it was built  of 
line 47557=>ugly pale bricks,  badly laid. Inside  it was damp and cheerless, and supper 
line 47558=>was served on a long  bare table that  had not been scrubbed  for weeks. The 
line 47559=>food  deserved no better  setting. The travellers  were  glad  to  leave the 
line 47560=>place.  It was about eighteen  miles to  Bywater,  and they  set off at  ten 
line 47561=>o'clock  in the morning. They  would have started earlier, only the delay so 
line 47562=>plainly annoyed the Shirriff-leader. The west wind had shifted northward and 
line 47563=>it was turning colder, but the rain was gone. 
line 47564=>     It was rather  a comic  cavalcade that left the village, though the few 
line 47565=>folk that came out to  stare at the  'get-up' of the travellers did not seem 
line 47566=>quite sure whether laughing was allowed. A dozen Shirriffs had been told off 
line 47567=>as escort to the  'prisoners'; but Merry made  them  march  in front,  while 
line 47568=>Frodo and his friends rode behind. Merry, Pippin, and  Sam sat at their ease 
line 47569=>laughing and talking  and singing, while the Shirriffs stumped along  trying 
line 47570=>to  look stern and important. Frodo, however, was  silent  and looked rather  
line 47571=>sad and thoughtful. 
line 47572=>
line 47573=>####-     The last person  they passed was a sturdy  old gaffer clipping a hedge. 
line 47574=>'Hullo, hu llo!' he jeered. 'Now who's arrested who?' 
line 47575=>     Two of the Shirriffs immediately  left the  party and went towards him. 
line 47576=>'Leader!' said  Merry. 'Order your  fellows back to their places at once, if 
line 47577=>you don't want me to deal with them!' 
line 47578=>     The two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily. 'Now 
line 47579=>get on!' said Merry,  and after that  the  travellers  saw  to it that their 
line 47580=>ponies'  pace was quick enough to  push  the Shirriffs along as fast as they 
line 47581=>could go. The sun came out,  and in spite of the  chilly wind they were soon  
line 47582=>puffing and sweating. 
line 47583=>     At  the Three-Farthing  Stone they  gave  it  up.  They had done nearly 
line 47584=>fourteen  miles with only one rest  at noon. It was now three  o'clock. They 
line 47585=>were hungry and very footsore and they could not  stand the pace. 
line 47586=>     'Well, come along in your own time!' said Merry. 'We are going on.' 
line 47587=>     'Good-bye, Cock -robin!' said Sam. 'I'll wait for you outside  The Green 
line 47588=>Dragon, if you haven't forgotten where that is. Don't dawdle on the way!' 
line 47589=>     'You're  br eaking  arrest,  that's what you're doing,'  said the leader  
line 47590=>ruefully, 'and I can't be answerable.' 
line 47591=>     'We shall  break  a  good many things  yet, and not ask you to answer ' 
line 47592=>said Pippin. 'Good luck to you!' 
line 47593=>     The  travellers trotted on, and as the  sun began to  sink towards  the 
line 47594=>White Downs far away on the western horizon they came to Bywater by its 
line 47595=>wide 
line 47596=>pool; and there  they had their first really  painful shock. This  was Frodo 
line 47597=>and Sam's own country, and they found out  now that they cared about it  more 
line 47598=>than any other place in  the world. Many  of  the houses that they had known  
line 47599=>were missing. Some seemed to  have been burned down. The pleasant row of 
line 47600=>old 
line 47601=>hobbit-holes in the  bank on the north  side  of the Pool were deserted, and 
line 47602=>their little  gardens that used to run down bright to the water's  edge were 
line 47603=>rank with weeds. Worse,  there was a whole line  of the ugly new houses  all 
line 47604=>along Pool Side, where the Hobbiton Road ran close to the bank. An avenue of 
line 47605=>trees had stood there. They were all  gone.   And  looking with dismay up the 
line 47606=>road towards Bag  End they saw  a  tall chimney of brick in the distance. It 
line 47607=>was pouring out black smoke into the evening air. 
line 47608=>     Sam was beside himself. 'I'm going right on, Mr. Frodo!' he cried. 'I'm 
line 47609=>going to see what's up. I want to find my gaffer.' 
line 47610=>
line 47611=>####-     'We  ought  to find  out first what we're in for, Sam,'  said Merry. 'I  
line 47612=>guess  that  the "Chief" will have a gang of ruffians handy.  We  had better  
line 47613=>find someone who will tell us how things are round here.' 
line 47614=>     But in the village of Bywater all  the houses and holes  were shut, and 
line 47615=>no  one greeted them. They wondered  at  this, but they soon  discovered the 
line 47616=>reason  of  it. When they  reached  The Green Dragon, the last house  on the 
line 47617=>Hobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken  windows, they were disturbed to 
line 47618=>see half a dozen  large ill-favoured Men lounging against the inn-wall; they 
line 47619=>were squint-eyed and sallow-faced. 
line 47620=>     'Like that friend of Bill Ferny's at Bree,' said Sam. 
line 47621=>     'Like many that I saw at Isengard,' muttered Merry. 
line 47622=>     The ruffians had clubs in their  hands  and  horns by their  belts, but 
line 47623=>they had no other weapons, as far as could be seen.  As the  travellers rode 
line 47624=>up they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way. 
line 47625=>     'Where d'you  think   you're  going?'  said  one,  the largest and  most  
line 47626=>evil-looking of the crew.  'There's no road for you any  further.  And where 
line 47627=>are those precious Shirriffs?' 
line 47628=>     'Coming along nicely,'  said  Merry.  'A  little  footsore, perhaps. We 
line 47629=>promised to wait for them here.' 
line 47630=>     'Garn, what did I  say?' said the ruffian to his mates. 'I told Sharkey 
line 47631=>it was no  good trusting those little fools. Some of our chaps ought to have 
line 47632=>been sent.' 
line 47633=>     'And  what difference would that have made,  pray?' said Merry. 'We are 
line 47634=>not used to footpads in this country, but we know how to deal with them.' 
line 47635=>     'Footpads, eh?'  said the man: 'So that's your tone, is  it? Change it, 
line 47636=>or we'll change  it for you.  You little folk are getting too  uppish. Don't  
line 47637=>you trust too much in the Boss's kind heart. Sharkey's come now and he'll do 
line 47638=>what Sharkey says.' 
line 47639=>     'And what may that be?' said Frodo quietly. 
line 47640=>     'This country wants waking up and setting to rights,' said the ruffian, 
line 47641=>'and Sharkey's going to do it; and make it hard, if you drive him to it. You  
line 47642=>need a  bigger Boss. And you'll get one  before the year is  out, if there's 
line 47643=>any more trouble. Then you'll learn a thing or two, you little rat-folk.' 
line 47644=>     'Indeed. I am glad to hear of your plans,' said Frodo. 'I am on  my way 
line 47645=>to call on Mr. Lotho, and he may be interested to hear of them too.' 
line 47646=>     The ruffian laughed. 'Lotho! He knows all right. Don't you worry. He'll 
line 47647=>do what  Sharkey says. Because if a  Boss  gives trouble, we can change him. 
line 47648=>
line 47649=>####-See? And if little folks try to push in where they're not wanted, we can put 
line 47650=>them out of mischief. See?' 
line 47651=>     'Yes, I see,' said Frodo.  'For one thing, I see that you're behind the 
line 47652=>times  and the news here. Much has happened  since you  left the South. Your 
line 47653=>day is over, and all other ruffians'. The Dark Tower has  fallen, and  there 
line 47654=>is  a  King in  Gondor. And  Isengard has been destroyed,  and your precious 
line 47655=>master is  a beggar in  the wilderness. I passed him on the road. The King's 
line 47656=>messengers will ride up the Greenway now not bullies from Isengard. ' 
line 47657=>     The  man stared at him  and smiled.  'A  beggar in  the wilderness!' he 
line 47658=>mocked.  'Oh, is he  indeed? Swagger it, swagger it, my little cock -a -whoop.  
line 47659=>But that won't  stop us  living  in this fat  little country  where you have 
line 47660=>lazed long enough. And' - he snapped his fingers in Frodo's face   -  'King's 
line 47661=>messengers! That for them! When I see one, I'll take notice, perhaps.' 
line 47662=>     This was too much for  Pippin. His thoughts  went back to  the Field of 
line 47663=>Cormallen, and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the Ring-bearer  'little 
line 47664=>cock -a -whoop'. He cast back his cloak, flashed out his sword, and the silver  
line 47665=>and sable of Gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward. 
line 47666=>     'I  am a  messenger of  the  King,' he  said. 'You are speaking  to the 
line 47667=>King's friend,  and one  of the most renowned in all the lands  of the West. 
line 47668=>You are a ruffian and a fool. Down on your knees in the road and ask pardon, 
line 47669=>or I will set this troll's bane in you!' 
line 47670=>     The sword glinted in the westering sun. Merry and Sam drew their swords 
line 47671=>also a nd rode  up to support  Pippin;  but Frodo did  not move. The ruffians 
line 47672=>gave back. Scaring  Breeland peasants, and  bullying bewildered hobbits, had 
line 47673=>been their work. Fearless  hobbits with  bright swords and grim faces were a  
line 47674=>great surprise.  And there  was a note in the voices of these newcomers that 
line 47675=>they had not heard before. It chilled them with fear. 
line 47676=>     'Go!'  said Merry. 'If you trouble this  village again, you will regret 
line 47677=>it.'  The three  hobbits  came  on, and then  the ruffians  turned and  fled 
line 47678=>running away up the Hobbiton Road; but they blew their horns as they ran. 
line 47679=>     'Well, we've come back none too soon,' said Merry. 
line 47680=>     'Not a day too soon. Perhaps too late, at any rate to save Lotho,' said 
line 47681=>Frodo. 'Miserable fool, but I am sorry for him.' 
line 47682=>     'Save Lotho? Whatever do you mean?' said Pippin. 'Destroy  him I should 
line 47683=>say.' 
line 47684=>     'I don't think you quite understand things, Pippin,' said Frodo. 'Lotho 
line 47685=>never meant things to come to this pass. He has been a wicked fool, but he's 
line 47686=>
line 47687=>####-caught now. The  ruffians are on top, gathering, robbing  and bullying,  and 
line 47688=>running or ruining things  as they  like, in his name.  And not  in his name 
line 47689=>even for much longer. He's a  prisoner in Bag  End  now,  I expect, and very 
line 47690=>frightened. We ought to try and rescue him.' 
line 47691=>     'Well I  am staggered!' said  Pippin.  'Of all the ends to  our journey 
line 47692=>that is the very last I should  have thought  of: to have to fight half-orcs 
line 47693=>and ruffians in the Shire itself - to rescue Lotho Pimple!' 
line 47694=>     'Fight?'  said  Frodo.  'Well,  I  suppose it  may  come  to  that. But 
line 47695=>remember: there is to be  no  slaying of hobbits, not even if they have gone 
line 47696=>over to the other side. Really gone over, I mean; not just obeying ruffians' 
line 47697=>orders  because they  are  frightened.  No hobbit has ever killed another on  
line 47698=>purpose in the Shire, and it is not to begin now. And nobody is to be killed 
line 47699=>at all,  if it  can be helped. Keep your tempers and hold your hands  to the 
line 47700=>last possible moment!' 
line 47701=>     'But  if  there  are many of  these  ruffians,'  said  Merry,  'it will 
line 47702=>certainly mean fighting. You won't rescue Lotho, or the Shire, just by being 
line 47703=>shocked and sad, my dear Frodo.' 
line 47704=>     'No,'  said Pippin. 'It  won't be  so easy scaring them  a second time. 
line 47705=>They were taken by  surprise. You heard  that horn-blowing? Ev idently  there 
line 47706=>are other ruffians near at hand. They'll be much bolder when there's more of 
line 47707=>them together. We ought  to think of taking cover somewhere for  the  night. 
line 47708=>After all we're only four, even if we are armed.' 
line 47709=>     'I've an idea,' said  Sam.  'Let's go  to old  Tom Cotton's down  South 
line 47710=>Lane! He  always was a  stout fellow. And he has a lot of lads that were all 
line 47711=>friends of mine.' 
line 47712=>     'No!'  said Merry.  'It's  no good "getting under cover".  That is just  
line 47713=>what people have been  doing, and just what these  ruffians like.  They will 
line 47714=>simply come  down on us in force, corner us, and  then drive us out, or burn 
line 47715=>us in. No, we have got to do something at once.' 
line 47716=>     'Do what?' said Pippin. 
line 47717=>     'Raise the Shire!' said Merry. 'Now! Wake all our people! They hate all 
line 47718=>this, you can  see: all of them except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few 
line 47719=>fools that want to be important, but  don't at all understand what is really 
line 47720=>going  on. But Shire-folk have  been  so comfortable so long they don't know 
line 47721=>what to  do. They just want  a match, though, and they'll go up in fire. The 
line 47722=>Chief's Men must know that. They'll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. 
line 47723=>We've only got a very short time. 
line 47724=>
line 47725=>####-     'Sam, you can make  a  dash for  Cotton's  farm, if  you like. He's the 
line 47726=>chief person round here,  and the sturdiest. Come on! I am going to blow the 
line 47727=>horn of Rohan, and give them all some music they have never heard before.' 
line 47728=>     They rode back to the middle of the village. There Sam turned aside and 
line 47729=>galloped off down the  lane that led south to Cotton's.  He had not gone far 
line 47730=>when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing  into the sky. Far over  
line 47731=>hill and field it echoed; and  so compelling  was that call that Sam himself 
line 47732=>almost turned and dashed back. His pony reared and neighed. 
line 47733=>     'On, lad! On!' he cried. 'We'll be going back soon.' 
line 47734=>     Then  he heard  Merry  change the  note, and  up went the  Horn-cry  of 
line 47735=>Buckland, shaking the air. 
line 47736=>     Awake! Awake! Fear, Fire, Foes! Awake! 
line 47737=>     Fire, Foes! Awake! 
line 47738=>     Behind him Sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of 
line 47739=>doors. In front of him lights sprang out in  the gloaming; dogs barked; feet 
line 47740=>came running. Before he got  to the lane's end there was Farmer Cotton  with 
line 47741=>three  of his lads, Young Tom,  Jolly, and Nick,  hurrying towards him. They 
line 47742=>had axes in their hands, and barred the way. 
line 47743=>     'Nay! It's not one of them ruffians,' Sam heard the farmer say. 'It's a  
line 47744=>hobbit by the size of it, but all dressed up queer. Hey!' he cried. 'Who are 
line 47745=>you, and what's all this to-do? ' 
line 47746=>     'It's Sam, Sam Gamgee. I've come back.' 
line 47747=>     Farmer Cotton came up close  and stared at him in the twilight. 'Well!' 
line 47748=>he exclaimed. 'The voice is right, and your face is  no worse  than  it was,  
line 47749=>Sam. But  I should a' passed you in the street in that gear. You've been  in 
line 47750=>foreign parts, seemingly. We feared you were dead.' 
line 47751=>     'That I ain't!'  said Sam.  'Nor Mr. Frodo. He's here and  his friends. 
line 47752=>And  that's  the to-do. They're raising the Shire. We're going to clear  out 
line 47753=>these ruffians, and their Chief too. We're starting now.' 
line 47754=>     'Good, good!' cried Farmer Cotton.  'So  it's  begun at last! I've been 
line 47755=>itching for trouble all this year, but folks wouldn't help. And I've had the 
line 47756=>wife  and Rosie to think of. These ruffians don't stick at nothing. But come 
line 47757=>on now, lads! Bywater is up! We must be in it!' 
line 47758=>     'What about Mrs.  Cotton and Rosie?' said Sam. 'It  isn't safe  yet for  
line 47759=>them to be left all alone.' 
line 47760=>     'My Nibs  is  with them. But you  can  go and help him,  if you  have a  
line 47761=>mind,' said Farmer Cotton with a grin. Then  he and his sons ran off towards 
line 47762=>
line 47763=>####-the village. 
line 47764=>     Sam hurried  to  the house. By the  large round  door at the top of the 
line 47765=>steps  from the wide yard stood  Mrs. Cotton and Rosie, and Nibs in front of 
line 47766=>them grasping a hay-fork. 
line 47767=>     'It's  me!' shouted Sam  as he trotted up.  'Sam Gamgee! So  don't  try 
line 47768=>prodding me, Nibs. Anyway, I've a mail -shirt on me.' 
line 47769=>     He  jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. They stared at him 
line 47770=>in silence.  'Good evening, Mrs. Cotton!' he said.  'Hullo Rosie!' 
line 47771=>     'Hullo, Sam!' said Rosie. 'Where've you been I They said you were dead;  
line 47772=>but I've been expecting you since the Spring. You haven't hurried have you?' 
line 47773=>     'Perhaps  not,'  said Sam abashed. 'But I'm hurrying now. We're setting 
line 47774=>about the ruffians, and I've got to get back to Mr. Frodo. But I thought I'd 
line 47775=>have a look and see how Mrs. Cotton was keeping, and you, Rosie.' 
line 47776=>     'We're keeping nicely, thank you,' said Mrs. Cotton.  'Or should be, if 
line 47777=>it weren't for these thieving ruffians.' 
line 47778=>     'Well, be  off with you!' said Rosie. 'If you've been looking after Mr. 
line 47779=>Frodo all this while, what d'you want  to leave  him for, as soon  as things 
line 47780=>look dangerous?' 
line 47781=>     This  was  too much  for Sam. It  needed a  week's answer, or none.  He 
line 47782=>turned away and mounted his pony. But as he started off, Rosie  ran down the 
line 47783=>steps. 
line 47784=>     'I think you look fine, Sam,'  she  said. 'Go on now! But  take care of 
line 47785=>yourself, and come straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians!' 
line 47786=>     When  Sam  got back  he found the  whole village roused. Already, apart  
line 47787=>from many younger lads,  more  than a hundred sturdy hobbits were  assembled 
line 47788=>with axes, and heavy  hammers, and  long knives, and stout staves: and a few 
line 47789=>had hunting-bows. More were still coming in from outlying farms. 
line 47790=>     Some of the village-folk had lit  a large fire, just to enliven things,  
line 47791=>and also because it was one of the things forbidden by the Chief. It  burned 
line 47792=>bright as  night came on. Others at Merry's orders  were setting up barriers 
line 47793=>across the road at each end of the  village. When  the Shirriffs  came up to 
line 47794=>the lower  one  they were  dumbfounded; but  as soon as they saw how  things 
line 47795=>were, most of  them took off  their  feathers and joined in  the revolt. The 
line 47796=>others slunk away. 
line 47797=>     Sam found Frodo and his friends by the  fire talking to old Tom Cotton, 
line 47798=>while an admiring crowd of Bywater folk stood round and stared. 
line 47799=>     'Well, what's the next move?' said Farmer Cotton. 
line 47800=>
line 47801=>####-     'I  can't  say,'  said Frodo, 'until  I  know more. How  many  of these 
line 47802=>ruffians are there?' 
line 47803=>     'That's  hard  to tell,' said  Cotton. 'They moves  about and comes and 
line 47804=>goes. There's  sometimes  fifty of them  in their sheds up Hobbiton way; but 
line 47805=>they go out  from there roving round,  thieving  or "gathering" as they call 
line 47806=>it. Still there's seldom  less  than a score  round the  Boss, as they names 
line 47807=>him. He's at Bag End, or was; but he don't go outside the rounds now. No one 
line 47808=>s seen him at all, in fact, for a week or two; but the Men  don't let no one 
line 47809=>go near.' 
line 47810=>     'Hobbiton's not their only place, is it?' said Pippin. 
line 47811=>     'No, more's the pity,' said Cotton. 'There's a  good few down south  in 
line 47812=>Longbottom and by Sarn Ford, I hear; and some more lurking in the Woody 
line 47813=>End; 
line 47814=>and they've sheds at Waymeet.  And then there's  the Lockholes, as they call  
line 47815=>'em:  the old  storage-tunnels  at  Michel Delving  that  they've made  into 
line 47816=>prisons  for  those as stand up to  them. Still I  reckon there's  not above 
line 47817=>three hundred of  them in the Shire all told, and  maybe less. We can master  
line 47818=>them, if we stick together.' 
line 47819=>     'Have they got any weapons?' asked Merry. 
line 47820=>     'Whips,  knives, and  clubs, enough for their dirty  work:  that's  all 
line 47821=>they've showed so far,' said Cotton. 'But I dare say they've got other gear, 
line 47822=>if it comes to fighting. Some have bows, anywa y. They've shot one or two  of 
line 47823=>our folk.' 
line 47824=>     'There  you are, Frodo!' said Merry. 'I knew we should have  to  fight. 
line 47825=>Well, they started the killing.' 
line 47826=>     'Not exactly,' said Cotton. 'Leastways not the  shooting. Tooks started 
line 47827=>that. You see our dad Mr. Peregrin, he's never had no truck with this Lotho, 
line 47828=>not  from the beginning: said that if anyone was going to play the chief  at 
line 47829=>this time of day,  it would  be the right Thain of the Shire and no upstart. 
line 47830=>And when Lotho sent his Men they got no  change out of him. Tooks are lucky, 
line 47831=>they've got those deep holes in the Green Hills,  the Great  Smials and all, 
line 47832=>and the  ruffians can't come at 'em; and they won't let the ruffians come on 
line 47833=>their land.  If they  do, Tooks hunt  'em. Tooks shot three for prowling and 
line 47834=>robbing.  After  that the  ruffians turned nastier. And they  keep  a pretty 
line 47835=>close watch on Tookland. No one gets in nor out of it now.' 
line 47836=>     'Good  for the  Tooks!' cried Pippin.  'But someone is going  to get in 
line 47837=>again, now. I am off to the Smials. Anyone coming with me to Tuckborough?' 
line 47838=>
line 47839=>####-     Pippin rode off with half  a dozen lads on ponies.  'See you soon!'  he 
line 47840=>cried. 'It's only  fourteen miles or so over the fields. I'll bring you back  
line 47841=>an army of Tooks in the morning.' Merry blew  a horn-call after them as they 
line 47842=>rode off into the gathering night. The people cheered. 
line 47843=>     'All the same,' said Frodo to all those who stood near, 'I wish for  no 
line 47844=>killing; not even of the ruffians, unless  it must be done, to  prevent them 
line 47845=>from hurting hobbits.' 
line 47846=>     'All right! '  said Merry.  'But  we shall be having  a visit  from  the 
line 47847=>Hobbiton gang any time  now, I  think. They  won't come just to  talk things 
line 47848=>over.  We'll try to deal with them  neatly, but  we must be prepared for the 
line 47849=>worst. Now I've got a plan.' 
line 47850=>     'Very good,' said Frodo. 'You make the arrangements.' 
line 47851=>     Just  then  some hobbits, who had  been sent out towards Hobbiton, came 
line 47852=>running in. 'They're coming!' they said. 'A score or more. But two have gone  
line 47853=>off west across country.' 
line 47854=>     'To Waymeet, that'll be, ' said  Cotton,  'to fetch  more  of  the gang. 
line 47855=>Well, it's fifteen mile each way. We needn't trouble about them just yet.' 
line 47856=>     Merry  hurried off to  give orders. Farmer Cotton cleared  the  street, 
line 47857=>sending everyone indoors, except the  older  hobbits who  had weapons of some 
line 47858=>sort. They had not long to wait. Soon they could hear loud  voices, and then  
line 47859=>the  tramping  of heavy feet. Presently  a whole squad of the  ruffians came 
line 47860=>down  the  road. They saw the barrier and laughed. They did not imagine that 
line 47861=>ther e  was anything in  this little  land  that would stand up to  twenty of 
line 47862=>their kind together. 
line 47863=>     The hobbits  opened the barrier and stood aside.  'Thank you!' the  Men 
line 47864=>jeered. 'Now run home to bed before you're whipped.' Then they marched along 
line 47865=>the street  shouting: 'Put those lights out! Get indoors  and stay there! Or 
line 47866=>we'll take fifty  of you  to the Lockholes for  a year. Get in!  The Boss is 
line 47867=>losing his temper.' 
line 47868=>     No one paid any heed to their orders; but as the  ruffians passed, they 
line 47869=>closed in  qu ietly behind and followed them.  When the  Men reached the fire 
line 47870=>there was Farmer Cotton standing all alone warming his hands. 
line 47871=>     'Who  are   you,  and  what   d'you   think  you're  doing?'  said  the 
line 47872=>ruffian-leader. 
line 47873=>     Farmer Cotton looked at him slowly. 'I was just going to ask you that,' 
line 47874=>he said. 'This isn't your country, and you're not wanted.' 
line 47875=>     'Well, you're wanted  anyhow,' said the leader. 'We want you.  Take him 
line 47876=>
line 47877=>####-lads! Lockholes for him, and give him something to keep him quiet!' 
line 47878=>     The Men took one step forward  and stopped short. There rose a  roar of 
line 47879=>voices all round them,  and suddenly  they were aware that Farmer Cotton was 
line 47880=>not  all  alone. They  were surrounded.  In  the dark  on  the  edge  of the 
line 47881=>firelight stood a ring  of hobbits  that had crept  up out  of  the shadows. 
line 47882=>There was nearly two hundred of them, all holding some weapon. 
line 47883=>     Merry stepped  forward. 'We have met before,' he  said  to  the leader, 
line 47884=>'and I warned you not to come  back here. I warn you again: you are standing 
line 47885=>in  the  light and you are covered  by archers. If you lay a finger on  this 
line 47886=>farmer, or on anyone  else, you will be  shot at once.  Lay down any weapons 
line 47887=>that you have!' 
line 47888=>     The leader looked round. He was trapped. But he was not scared, not now 
line 47889=>with a score of his fellows to  back  him.  He knew too little of hobbits to 
line 47890=>understand his peril.  Foolishly he  decided to  fight. It  would be easy to 
line 47891=>break out. 
line 47892=>     'At 'em lads!' he cried. 'Let 'em have it!' 
line 47893=>     With a  long knife in his left hand and a  club in  the other he made a  
line 47894=>rush  at the  ring, trying  to burst out back towards Hobbiton.  He aimed  a  
line 47895=>savage blow at Merry who stood in his way.  He fell dead with four arrows in 
line 47896=>him: 
line 47897=>     That was enough for the others.  They gave in. Their weapons were taken  
line 47898=>from them, and they were roped  together,  and marched  off to  an empty hut 
line 47899=>that they had built themselves, and there they were tied hand  and foot, and 
line 47900=>locked up under guard. The dead leader was dragged off and buried. 
line 47901=>     'Seems almost too easy  after all, don't it?' said Cotton.  'I said  we 
line 47902=>could master them. But we needed a call. You came  back in the nick o' time, 
line 47903=>Mr. Merry.' 
line 47904=>     'There's more to be done still,' said Merry. 'If  you're  right in your 
line 47905=>reckoning, we haven't dealt with a tithe of them yet. But it's  dark now.  I 
line 47906=>think the  next stroke must  wait  until morning. Then  we must  call on the 
line 47907=>Chief.' 
line 47908=>     'Why not  now?' said Sam.  'It's not much more than  six o'clock. And I 
line 47909=>want to see my gaffer. D'you know what's come of him, Mr. Cotton?' 
line 47910=>     'He's not too  well,  and not too bad, Sam,' said the farmer. 'They dug 
line 47911=>up Bagshot Row, and that  was a sad blow  to  him. He's in one of  them  new 
line 47912=>houses that  the Chief's Men  used to  build while  they still did any  work 
line 47913=>other than burning and thieving:  not  above a mile from the end of Bywater. 
line 47914=>
line 47915=>####-But he comes around to me, when he gets a chance,  and I see he's better fed 
line 47916=>than some of the poor bodies. All against The Rules, of course. I'd have had 
line 47917=>him with me, but that wasn't allowed.' 
line 47918=>     'Thank'ee indeed, Mr. Cotton, and I'll never forget it,' said Sam. 'But 
line 47919=>I want to see him. That Boss and that Sharkey, as they  spoke of, they might  
line 47920=>do a mischief up there before the morning.' 
line 47921=>     'All right, Sam,' said Cotton.  'Choose a  lad or two, and go and fetch 
line 47922=>him to my  house. You'll not have need to  go near the old  Hobbiton village 
line 47923=>over Water. My Jolly here will show you.' 
line 47924=>     Sam went off. Merry arranged for look -outs round the village and guards 
line 47925=>at  the barriers during  the  night. Then he and Frodo went off with  Farmer  
line 47926=>Cotton. They sat with  the family in the warm kitchen, and the Cottons asked 
line 47927=>a  few polite  questions about  their travels,  but hardly  listened  to the 
line 47928=>answers: they were far more concerned with events in the Shire. 
line 47929=>     'It all began with Pimple, as we call him,' said Farmer Cotton; 'and it 
line 47930=>began as soon as you'd  gone off, Mr. Frodo.  He'd funny  ideas had  Pimple. 
line 47931=>Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and  then order other folk about. 
line 47932=>It soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him; 
line 47933=>and  he was  always grabbing  more, though  where he got  the  money  was  a  
line 47934=>mystery:  mills and malt-houses and  inns,  and farms, and leaf-plantations.  
line 47935=>He'd already bought Sandyman's mill before he came to Bag End, seemingly. 
line 47936=>     'Of course he started with a lot of property in the Southfarthing which 
line 47937=>he had from his dad; and it seems he'd been selling a  lot o' the best leaf,  
line 47938=>and sending it away quietly for a year or two.  But at the end o'  last year 
line 47939=>he began sending away  loads of  stuff,  not only leaf. Things  began to get 
line 47940=>short, and winter coming on, too. Folk got angry, but  he had his answer.  A 
line 47941=>lot of Men, ruffians mostly,  came with great waggons, some to carry off the 
line 47942=>goods south-away,  and  others  to stay. And  more came.  And before we knew 
line 47943=>where we were they were planted here  and there all over the Shire, and were 
line 47944=>felling trees  and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just  as 
line 47945=>they liked. At first goods and damage was paid  for by Pimple; but soon they 
line 47946=>began lording it around and taking what they wanted. 
line 47947=>     'Then there was a bit  of trouble,  but not  enough. Old Will the Mayor  
line 47948=>set off for  Bag End to protest, but he never got there. Ruffians laid hands 
line 47949=>on him  and took and locked him up in a hole in Michel Delving, and there he 
line 47950=>is  now.  And after that, it  would bc soon after New Year,  there wasn't no 
line 47951=>more Mayor, and Pimple called himself Chief Shirriff, or just Chief, and did 
line 47952=>
line 47953=>####-as  he liked; and  if anyone  got "uppish" as  they called it, they followed 
line 47954=>Will. So things went from bad to worse. There wasn't no smoke left, save for 
line 47955=>the Men;  and the  Chief didn't hold with beer, save for his Men, and closed 
line 47956=>all the inns;  and everything except Rules got  shorter and  shorter, unless 
line 47957=>one could hide a bit  of one's own  when the ruffians  went  round gathering 
line 47958=>stuff  up "for fair  distribution": which meant  they got it  and we didn't, 
line 47959=>except for the leavings which you could have at the Shirriff-houses,  if you  
line 47960=>could  stomach them.  All  very bad.  But since Sharkey came it's been plain  
line 47961=>ruination.' 
line 47962=>     'Who is this Sharkey?'  said Merry. 'I heard  one of the ruffians speak 
line 47963=>of him.' 
line 47964=>     'The biggest  ruffian o' the lot, seemingly,' answered  Cotton. 'It was 
line 47965=>about last harvest,  end o'  September maybe,  that  we first heard of  him. 
line 47966=>We've never seen him, but he's up at Bag End; and he's the real Chief now, I  
line 47967=>guess.  All the ruffians  do what he says; and what he says is mostly  hack, 
line 47968=>burn, and ruin; and now it s come to killing. There s  no longer even any bad 
line 47969=>sense in it. They cut down trees and let 'em lie, they burn houses and build 
line 47970=>no more. 
line 47971=>     'Take Sandyman's mill now. Pimple  knocked it down almost as soon as he 
line 47972=>came to Bag End. Then he  brought in a lot o' dirty-looking Men  to  build a  
line 47973=>bigger one and fill it full o' wheels and outlandish contraptions. Only that 
line 47974=>fool Ted was pleased by  that, and he works  there  cleaning  wheels for the 
line 47975=>Men, where his dad was the  Miller and his own master.  Pimple's idea was to 
line 47976=>grind  more  and faster, or  so he said. He's got other mills  like  it. But 
line 47977=>you've got to have grist before you can grind; and there was no more for the 
line 47978=>new mill to do than for the  old. But since Sharkey came they don't grind no 
line 47979=>more corn at all. They're always a -hammering and a -letting out a smoke and a  
line 47980=>stench, and there isn't no peace even at night  in  Hobbiton.  And they pour 
line 47981=>out filth a  purpose; they've  fouled all  the lower Water  and it's getting 
line 47982=>down into Brandywine. If they want to make the Shire into a desert,  they're 
line 47983=>going the right way about it. I don't believe that fool of a Pimple's behind 
line 47984=>all this. It's Sharkey, I say.' 
line 47985=>     'That's right!' put in Young Tom. 'Why, they even took Pimple's old ma, 
line 47986=>that  Lobelia, and he was  fond  of her,  if no one  else was.  Some  of the 
line 47987=>Hobbiton folk, they  saw it. She  comes down the lane with her old umbrella. 
line 47988=>Some of the ruffians were going up with a big cart. 
line 47989=>     ' "Where be you a -going?" says she. 
line 47990=>
line 47991=>####-     ' "To Bag End," says they. 
line 47992=>     ' "What for?" says she. 
line 47993=>     ' "To put up some sheds for Sharkey," says they. 
line 47994=>     ' "Who said you could?" says she. 
line 47995=>     ' "Sharkey," says they. "So get out o' the road, old hagling!" 
line 47996=>     '  "I'll give you Sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!" says  she, and 
line 47997=>ups with  her umbrella and goes for the leader. near twice her size. So they 
line 47998=>took  her. Dragged her off  to the Lockholes, at her age  too.  They've took  
line 47999=>others we miss more, but  there's no  denying she  showed  more  spirit than 
line 48000=>most.' 
line 48001=>     Into the middle of this talk came Sam, bursting in with his gaffer. Old 
line 48002=>Gamgee did not look much older, but he was a little deafer. 
line 48003=>     'Good evening. Mr. Baggins!' he said. 'Glad indeed I am to see you safe 
line 48004=>back. But  I've  a bone to pick with you, in a manner  o' speaking, if I may 
line 48005=>make so bold. You didn't never ought  to  have a' sold Bag End, as  I always 
line 48006=>said. That's what started all the mischief. And while you're been trapessing 
line 48007=>in foreign parts, chasing  Black Men  up  mountains from  what my  Sam says,  
line 48008=>though what for he don't make clear, they've been and dug up Bagshot Row and 
line 48009=>ruined my taters!' 
line 48010=>     'I  am very  sorry, Mr.  Gamgee,' said Frodo. 'But now I've  come back, 
line 48011=>I'll do my best to make amends.' 
line 48012=>     'Well,  you  can't say  fairer than that,' said  the gaffer. 'Mr. Frodo 
line 48013=>Baggins  is a real gentlehobbit, I always have said, whatever  you may think  
line 48014=>of some others of the name, begging your pardon. And I hope my Sam's 
line 48015=>behaved 
line 48016=>hisself and given satisfaction?' 
line 48017=>     'Perfect satisfaction, Mr. Gamgee,'  said Frodo. 'Indeed,  if you  will 
line 48018=>believe it, he's  now one of the most famous  people  in all  the lands, and 
line 48019=>they are making songs about his deeds from  here to  the Sea and beyond  the 
line 48020=>Great River.' Sam blushed,  but he looked gratefully at Frodo,  for  Rosie's 
line 48021=>eyes were shining and she was smiling at him. 
line 48022=>     'It takes a lot o' believing,' said  the gaffer, 'though I can see he's 
line 48023=>been mixing in strange company. What's come of his weskit? I don't hold with 
line 48024=>wearing ironmongery, whether it wears well or no.' 
line 48025=>     Farmer  Cotton's household  and  all  his  guests  were  up  early next 
line 48026=>morning. Nothing  had  been  heard  in  the  night, but more  trouble  would 
line 48027=>certainly  come before the  day was old.  'Seems as if none o' the  ruffians 
line 48028=>
line 48029=>####-were left  up at Bag End,' said Cotton; 'but  the gang from Waymeet will  be 
line 48030=>along any time now.' 
line 48031=>     After breakfast  a messenger from the Tookland rode in. He was in  high  
line 48032=>spirits. 'The Thain has raised  all our country,' he said, 'and the news  is 
line 48033=>going like fire all ways. The ruffians that were watching our land have fled 
line 48034=>off south, those that escaped alive. The  Thain has gone after them, to hold 
line 48035=>off the big gang down  that way; but he's sent Mr Peregrin back with all the 
line 48036=>other folk he can spare.' 
line 48037=>     The next news  was less good. Merry, who had been out  all  night, came 
line 48038=>riding in about ten  o'clock. 'There's a big band about four miles away,' he 
line 48039=>said.  'They're  coming along the  road from Waymeet, but a good many  stray 
line 48040=>ruffians have joined up with them. There must be close on a hundred of them; 
line 48041=>and they're fire-raising as they come. Curse them!' 
line 48042=>     'Ah! This  lot  won't stay to  talk, they'll kill, if they  can,'  said 
line 48043=>Farmer  Cotton.  'If Tooks don't come sooner, we'd best get behind cover and 
line 48044=>shoot without  arguing.  There's  got to  be  some  fighting  before this is 
line 48045=>settled, Mr. Frodo.' 
line 48046=>     The  Tooks  did come sooner.  Before long  they  marched in, a  hundred  
line 48047=>strong,  from  Tuckborough and  the Green Hills with  Pippin at their  head. 
line 48048=>Merry now  had  enough  sturdy  hobbitry to deal with  the  ruffians. Scouts 
line 48049=>reported  that  they  were  keeping  close  together.  They  knew  that  the 
line 48050=>countryside had risen against  them,  and  plainly  meant  to  deal with the 
line 48051=>rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in Bywater. But however grim they, might 
line 48052=>be, they  seemed to have  no leader among  them who understood warfare. 
line 48053=>They 
line 48054=>came on without any precautions. Merry laid his plans quickly. 
line 48055=>     The ruffians  came tramping along  the  East Road, and  without halting 
line 48056=>turned up the Bywater Road,  which ran for  some way sloping up between 
line 48057=>high 
line 48058=>banks with low hedges on top. Round a bend,  about a  furlong from  the main 
line 48059=>road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them. 
line 48060=>At the same  moment they  became aware that  the hedges on  both sides,  just 
line 48061=>above their  heads, were all lined with hobbits. Behind them  other  hobbits 
line 48062=>now pushed out  some more waggons  that had  been  hidden in a field, and so 
line 48063=>blocked the way back. A voice spoke to them from above. 
line 48064=>     'Well, you  have walked into a trap, '  said Merry. 'Your  fellows  from 
line 48065=>Hobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the  rest are prisoners. Lay down 
line 48066=>
line 48067=>####-your weapons! Then  go  back twenty paces and sit down. Any who try to 
line 48068=>break 
line 48069=>out will be shot.' 
line 48070=>     But  the ruffians could  not now  be  cowed  so easily.  A few of  them 
line 48071=>obeyed, but were immediately set on  by their fellows. A score or more broke 
line 48072=>back  and  charged the waggons. Six were shot, but the  remainder burst out, 
line 48073=>killing two hobbits, and then  scattering across country in the direction of 
line 48074=>the  Woody End. Two more fell as they ran.  Merry blew a loud horn-call, and 
line 48075=>there were answering calls from a distance. 
line 48076=>     'They won't get far,' said  Pippin. 'All that country is alive with our 
line 48077=>hunters now.' 
line 48078=>     Behind,  the trapped Men in the lane,  still about four score, tried to 
line 48079=>climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged  to shoot many  
line 48080=>of them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest and  most desperate 
line 48081=>got out on the west side, and  attacked  their enemies  fiercely ,  being now 
line 48082=>more  bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were 
line 48083=>wavering, when Merry and Pippin,  who were on the east side, came across and 
line 48084=>charged  the ruffians. Merry himself slew  the  leader, a  great squint -eyed 
line 48085=>brute like  a huge orc.  Then he drew  his forces off,  encircling the  last 
line 48086=>remnant of the Men in a wide ring of archers. 
line 48087=>     At last all  was over.  Nearly  seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the 
line 48088=>field, and a dozen  were prisoners. Nineteen hobbits  were killed, a nd  some 
line 48089=>thirty were wounded. The dead  ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off 
line 48090=>to an  old sand-pit nearby and there buried:  in the Battle  Pit, as it  was 
line 48091=>afterwards called. The fallen hobbits were  laid together in a grave on  the 
line 48092=>hill-side,  wher e later a great  stone was set up with a garden about it. So 
line 48093=>ended the  Battle of Bywater, 1419, the last battle fought in the Shire, and 
line 48094=>the  only battle since the  Greenfields, 1147, away up in the Northfarthing. 
line 48095=>In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a  chapter  to 
line 48096=>itself in the Red Book, and  the names of all those  who took part were made 
line 48097=>into a Roll, and learned by heart by Shire-historians. The very considerable 
line 48098=>rise in the fame and fortune of the Cottons dates from this time; but at the 
line 48099=>top of the Roll  in all  accounts  stand the names of  Captains Meriadoc and 
line 48100=>Peregrin. 
line 48101=>     Frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief 
line 48102=>part had  been to prevent the hobbits  in their wrath at  their losses, from 
line 48103=>slaying those  of  their enemies who  threw  down  their  weapons. When  the 
line 48104=>
line 48105=>####-fighting  was over,  and  the later labours were ordered, Merry, Pippin, and 
line 48106=>Sam joined him, and  they rode back with the Cottons. They ate a late midday 
line 48107=>meal, and then Frodo said with a  sigh: 'Well, I suppose it is time now that 
line 48108=>we dealt with the "Chief".' 
line 48109=>     'Yes indeed; the  sooner the better,'  said  Merry.  'And don't be  too 
line 48110=>gentle! He's  responsible  for bringing  in these ruffians, and  for all the 
line 48111=>evil they have done.' 
line 48112=>     Farmer Cotton  collected an escort  of some two  dozen  sturdy hobbits. 
line 48113=>'For it's only a guess that  there is no ruffians left at Bag End,' he said. 
line 48114=>'We don't know.' Then  they set out  on foot. Frodo, Sam,  Merry, and Pippin 
line 48115=>led the way. 
line 48116=>     It was one of the saddest hours  in their lives. The great chimney rose 
line 48117=>up  before them;  and as  they drew  near the old  village across the Water, 
line 48118=>through rows of new  mean houses along each side of the  road, they saw  the 
line 48119=>new mill in all its  frowning and  dirty ugliness:  a  great  brick building 
line 48120=>straddling  the  stream, which  it  fouled  with  a  steaming  and  stinking 
line 48121=>overflow. All along the Bywater Road every tree had been felled. 
line 48122=>     As  they crossed the bridge  and looked up the Hill  they  gasped. Even 
line 48123=>Sam's vision in the Mirror  had not prepared  him for what they saw. The Old 
line 48124=>Grange  on the  west side had been knocked down, and its place taken by rows 
line 48125=>of tarred sheds. All the chestnuts were gone. The  banks and  hedgerows were 
line 48126=>broken. Great  waggons wer e standing in  disorder in  a field beaten bare of 
line 48127=>grass. Bagshot  Row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry. Bag End up. 
line 48128=>beyond 
line 48129=>could not be seen for a clutter of large huts. 
line 48130=>     'They've cut it down!' cried Sam. 'They've cut down the Party Tree!' He 
line 48131=>pointed to where the tree. had stood under which Bilbo had made his Farewell 
line 48132=>Speech. It was lying lopped and  dead in the field. As if this was the  last 
line 48133=>straw Sam burst into tears. 
line 48134=>     A laugh put an end to them. There was a surly hobbit lounging over  the 
line 48135=>low wall of the  mill-yard. He was grimy -faced and  black -handed.  'Don't  'ee 
line 48136=>like it, Sam?'  he sneered. 'But  you always  was soft. I thought you'd gone  
line 48137=>off in  one o' them ships  you used to prattle about, sailing, sailing. What 
line 48138=>d'you want to come back for? We've work to do in the Shire now.' 
line 48139=>     'So I see,' said Sam. 'No time for washing, but time for wall-propping. 
line 48140=>But  see here,  Master  Sandyman,  I've a score to pay in this village,  and 
line 48141=>don't you make it any longer with your  jeering, or you'll  foot a bill  too 
line 48142=>
line 48143=>####-big for your purse.' 
line 48144=>     Ted Sandyman spat over the wall: 'Garn!' he said. 'You can't touch  me.  
line 48145=>I'm  a friend o'  the  Boss's. But he'll touch you all right, if I have  any 
line 48146=>more of your mouth.' 
line 48147=>     'Don't  waste any more words  on  the  fool, Sam!' said Frodo. 'I  hope 
line 48148=>there are not many more hobbits that have become like  this.  It  would be a  
line 48149=>worse trouble than all the damage the Men have done.' 
line 48150=>     'You are dirty and insolent, Sandyman,' said Merry. 'And also very much 
line 48151=>out of your reckoning. We are just going up the Hill to remove your precious 
line 48152=>Boss. We have dealt with his Men.' 
line 48153=>     Ted gaped, for at  that moment he first caught sight of the escort that 
line 48154=>at a sign from Merry now marched over the bridge. Dashing back into the mill 
line 48155=>he ran out with a horn and blew it loudly. 
line 48156=>     'Save your breath!' laughed Merry. 'I've a better.' Then lifting up his 
line 48157=>silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang  over the Hill; and out of 
line 48158=>the  holes and sheds and shabby houses of Hobbiton the hobbits answered, and 
line 48159=>came pouring out, and  with cheers and loud cries they followed  the company 
line 48160=>up the road to Bag End. 
line 48161=>     At the top of the lane the party halted, and Frodo and his friends went 
line 48162=>on; and they came at  last to the once beloved place. The garden wa s full of 
line 48163=>huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that  they cut off all 
line 48164=>their  light. There were piles of refuse everywhere. The door  was  scarred; 
line 48165=>the bell-chain  was dangling  loose, and the bell would not  ring.  Knocking 
line 48166=>brought no answer. At length they pushed and the door yielded. They went in. 
line 48167=>The  place stank  and was  full of filth and  disorder: it did not appear to 
line 48168=>have been used for some time. 
line 48169=>     'Where  is that miserable Lotho hiding?' said Merry. They  had searched 
line 48170=>every room  and found no living thing save rats and  mice. 'Shall we turn on 
line 48171=>the others to search the sheds?' 
line 48172=>     'This is  worse than Mordor!' said Sam. 'Much worse in  a way. It comes 
line 48173=>home to you, as  they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it  
line 48174=>was all ruined.' 
line 48175=>     'Yes,  this is Mordor,' said Frodo. 'Just one of its works. Saruman was 
line 48176=>doing  its  work all  the time,  even  when he  thought  he was working  for  
line 48177=>himself. And the same with those that Saruman tricked, like Lotho.' 
line 48178=>     Merry looked round in dismay and disgust. 'Let's get out!' he said. 'If 
line 48179=>I had known all the  mischief he had caused, I should  have stuffed my pouch 
line 48180=>
line 48181=>####-down Saruman's throat.' 
line 48182=>     'No doubt, no doubt! But you did not, and so I  am  able to welcome you  
line 48183=>home.' There standing at the  door was Saruman himself, looking well -fed and 
line 48184=>well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement. 
line 48185=>     A sudden light broke on Frodo. 'Sharkey!' he cried. 
line 48186=>     Saruman laughed.  'So you have heard the name, have you? All  my people 
line 48187=>used to call me that in Isengard, I believe. A sign of affection, possibly.( 
line 48188=>But evidently you did not expect to see me here.' 
line 48189=>     'I did not,' said Frodo. 'But I might  have guessed.  A little mischief 
line 48190=>in a mean way: Gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it. 
line 48191=>     'Quite  capable,'  said Saruman, 'and more  than a little. You  made me 
line 48192=>laugh, you hobbit-lordlings, riding  along with  all  those  great people so 
line 48193=>secure and so pleased with your little selves. You thought you had done very 
line 48194=>well out of it a ll, and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time 
line 48195=>in the country. Saruman's home could  be all wrecked, and he could be turned 
line 48196=>out, but no one could touch  yours. Oh  no!  Gandalf would look  after  your  
line 48197=>affairs.' 
line 48198=>     Saruman laughed  again. 'Not he! When his tools have done their task he 
line 48199=>drops them. But you must  go dangling  after him,  dawdling and talking, and 
line 48200=>riding round twice as far as you needed. "Well," thought I, "if they're such  
line 48201=>fools, I  will  get ahead of them and  teach  them  a  lesson.  One ill turn 
line 48202=>deserves another." It  would  have been  a  sharper lesson, if  only you had 
line 48203=>given  me a  little  more time and more Men. Still  I have already done much  
line 48204=>that you will  find  it hard to mend or undo in your lives. And  it  will be 
line 48205=>plea sant to think of that and set it against my injuries.' 
line 48206=>     'Well, if that is what you find  pleasure in,' said Frodo, 'I pity you. 
line 48207=>It will be a pleasure of memory only, I fear. Go at once and never return!' 
line 48208=>     The hobbits of the villages  had  seen Saruman  come out of one  of the 
line 48209=>huts, and at once they came crowding up  to  the door of  Bag End. When they 
line 48210=>heard Frodo's command, they murmured angrily: 
line 48211=>     'Don't let him go! Kill him! He's a villain and a murderer. Kill him!' 
line 48212=>     Saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. 'Kill  him!' he 
line 48213=>mocked. 'Kill him, if you think there  are enough of you, my brave hobbits!' 
line 48214=>He drew himself  up and stared at them darkly  with his black eyes.  'But do 
line 48215=>not think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my power! Whoever strikes 
line 48216=>me shall  be accursed. And if my blood stains the Shire, it shall wither and 
line 48217=>never again be healed.' 
line 48218=>
line 48219=>####-     The hobbits recoiled. But Frodo said: 'Do  not believe him! He has lost  
line 48220=>all power, save his voice that  can still daunt you and deceive you, if  you  
line 48221=>let it.  But  I will not  have him slain. It is useless to meet revenge with 
line 48222=>revenge: it will heal nothing. Go, Saruman, by the speediest way!' 
line 48223=>     'Worm! Worm!' Saruman called; and out of a  nearby hut came 
line 48224=>Wormtongue, 
line 48225=>crawling, almost like a dog. To the road again, Worm!' said Saruman.  'These 
line 48226=>fine fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again. Come along!' 
line 48227=>     Saruman turned  to go, and Wormtongue shuffled after  him.  But even as 
line 48228=>Saruman passed close to Frodo a knife flashed in his  hand,  and  he stabbed 
line 48229=>swiftly.  The blade turned  on  the hidden  mail-coat  and snapped.  A dozen  
line 48230=>hobbits, led by Sam, leaped forward with a cry and flung  the villain to the 
line 48231=>ground. Sam drew his sword. 
line 48232=>     'No, Sam!' said  Frodo. 'Do not kill him even now.  For he has not hurt 
line 48233=>me.  And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was 
line 48234=>great once, of  a  noble kind that we  should  not  dare to raise  our hands 
line 48235=>against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us;  but  I would still  spare 
line 48236=>him, in the hope that he may find it.' 
line 48237=>     Saruman rose to his feet, and stared at Frodo. There was a strange look  
line 48238=>in his  eyes of mingled wonder and  respect and  hatred.  'You  have  grown, 
line 48239=>Halfling,' he said. 'Yes, you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel. 
line 48240=>You  have  robbed  my revenge of  sweetness,  and  now  I must go  hence  in 
line 48241=>bitterness, in debt to your mercy.  I hate it and you! Well, I go and I will 
line 48242=>trouble you no more. But do  not expect me to wish you health and long life. 
line 48243=>You will have neither. But that is not my doing. I merely foretell.' 
line 48244=>     He walked away, and  the hobbits made a lane for him to pass; but their 
line 48245=>knuckles whitened as  they gripped  on their  weapons. Wormtongue hesitated, 
line 48246=>and then followed his master. 
line 48247=>     'Wormtongue!' called Frodo. 'You need not follow him. I know of no evil  
line 48248=>you have done to me. You can  have rest and food here for a while, until you  
line 48249=>are stronger and can go your own ways.' 
line 48250=>     Wormtongue  halted  and  looked  back at  him, half  prepared  to  stay. 
line 48251=>Saruman turned.  'No evil?'  he  cackled. 'Oh no! Even when he sneaks out at 
line 48252=>night it is only to look at the stars. But did I hear someone ask where poor  
line 48253=>Lotho is hiding? You know, don't you, Worm? Will you tell them?' 
line 48254=>     Wormtongue cowered down and whimpered: 'No, no!' 
line 48255=>     'Then I  will,'  said Saruman.  'Worm killed  your  Chief,  poor little 
line 48256=>
line 48257=>####-fellow, your nice little Boss. Didn't you, Worm? Stabbed him in his sleep, I 
line 48258=>believe.  Buried him, I hope;  though Worm has been very hungry lately.  No, 
line 48259=>Worm is not really nice. You had better leave him to me.' 
line 48260=>     A look of wild hatred came into Wormtongue's red eyes. 'You told me to;  
line 48261=>you made me do it,' he hissed. 
line 48262=>     Saruman laughed. 'You do what Sharkey says,  always, don't  you,  Worm?  
line 48263=>Well,  now  he  says:  follow!'  He  kicked  Wormtongue in  the face  as  he 
line 48264=>grovelled, and  turned and made off. But at that something snapped: suddenly 
line 48265=>Wormtongue rose up, drawing a hidden knife, and then with a snarl like a dog 
line 48266=>he sprang on Saruman's back, jerked his head back, cut his throat, and  with 
line 48267=>a yell  ran off  down the lane. Before Frodo could recover or  speak a word, 
line 48268=>three hobbit-bows twanged and Wormtongue fell dead. 
line 48269=>     To the dismay of those that stood by, about the  body of Saruman a grey 
line 48270=>mist gathered, and  rising slowly to a great height like smoke  from a fire, 
line 48271=>as a pale shrouded  figure it loomed over the Hill. For a moment it wavered,  
line 48272=>looking to the West; but out of the West came a cold wind, and it bent away,  
line 48273=>and with a sigh dissolved into nothing. 
line 48274=>     Frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it 
line 48275=>seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, 
line 48276=>and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. Lifting up 
line 48277=>the skirt  of the dirty cloak  that sprawled beside  it, he covered it over, 
line 48278=>and turned away. 
line 48279=>     'And  that's  the end of that,'  said Sam. 'A nasty end,  and I  wish I 
line 48280=>needn't have seen it; but it's a good riddance.' 
line 48281=>     'And the very last end of the War, I hope,' said Merry. 
line 48282=>     'I hope so,' said Frodo and sighed. 'The very last stroke. But to think  
line 48283=>that it  should fall here, at the very  door  of Bag End! Among all my hopes 
line 48284=>and fears at least I never expected that.' 
line 48285=>     'I shan't call it  the end, till we've cleared  up  the mess,' said Sam 
line 48286=>gloomily. 'And that'll take a lot of time and work.' 
line 48287=> 
line 48288=>
line 48289=>####- 
line 48290=>
line 48291=>Chapter 9. The Grey Havens 
line 48292=>
line 48293=> 
line 48294=> 
line 48295=>     The clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but  it took  less time 
line 48296=>than Sam had feared. The day  after the battle Frodo  rode to Michel Delving 
line 48297=>and released the prisoners from  the Lockholes. One  of the first  that they 
line 48298=>found was  poor Fredegar Bolger, Fatty no longer. He had been taken when the 
line 48299=>ruffians smoked  out a band of rebels that  he  led from their hidings up in 
line 48300=>the Brockenbores by the hills of Scary. 
line 48301=>     'You  would have  done better  to  come with us  after  all,  poor  old 
line 48302=>Fredegar!' said Pippin, as they carried him out too weak to walk. 
line 48303=>     He opened an eye and tried gallantly to  smile. 'Who's this young giant  
line 48304=>with the loud voice?' he  whispered. 'Not little Pippin! What's your size in 
line 48305=>hats now?' 
line 48306=>     Then  there  was Lobelia. Poor thing, she looked very old and thin when 
line 48307=>they rescued her  from a dark and narrow  cell. She insisted on hobbling out 
line 48308=>on her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and there was such clapping and 
line 48309=>cheering when she appeared,  leaning on Frodo's arm but still clutching  her  
line 48310=>umbrella, that she was quite touched, and drove away in tears. She had never 
line 48311=>in her life been popular before. But she was crushed  by the news of  Lotho's 
line 48312=>murder, and she would' not return to Bag End. She gave it back to Frodo, and 
line 48313=>went to her own people, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle. 
line 48314=>     When the poor  creature died next Spring-she  was after all more than a  
line 48315=>hundred years  old  - Frodo was  surprised and much  moved: she had left all  
line 48316=>that remained of her money and of Lotho's for him to use in helping  hobbits 
line 48317=>made homeless by the troubles. So that feud was ended. 
line 48318=>     Old Will Whitfoot had been in the Lockholes longer than any, and though 
line 48319=>he had  perhaps  been treated  less harshly  than  some,  he needed a lot of 
line 48320=>feeding up before he could look the part of Mayor; so Frodo agreed to act as 
line 48321=>his Deputy, until Mr. Whitfoot was  in shape again. The  only  thing that he 
line 48322=>did as  Deputy Mayor was  to reduce the Shirriffs to  their proper functions 
line 48323=>and numbers. The task of  hunting  out the last remnant of  the ruffians was 
line 48324=>left to Merry and  Pippin,  and  it was soon done. The southern gangs, after  
line 48325=>hearing the news of the Battle of  Bywater, fled out of the land and offered 
line 48326=>little resistance to the Thain. Before the Year's End the few survivors were 
line 48327=>rounded  up in  the  woods,  and those  that  surrendered were shown  to the 
line 48328=>
line 48329=>####-borders.  
line 48330=>     Meanwhile the  labour  of  repair went on apace, and   Sam was kept very 
line 48331=>busy. Hobbits can work like bees when the mood  and the need comes on  
line 48332=>them. 
line 48333=>Now  there were thousands of willing  hands of all ages, from the  small but 
line 48334=>nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of 
line 48335=>the gaffers  and gammers.  Before Yule not a brick was left standing of  the 
line 48336=>new Shirriff-houses  or of anything that had been built by 'Sharkey's  Men';  
line 48337=>but the bricks were used to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger  and  
line 48338=>drier. Great stores of goods a nd  food, and beer,  were found that had  been 
line 48339=>hidden away  by  the  ruffians in  sheds and barns and deserted  holes,  and 
line 48340=>especially in the tunnels  at Michel  Delving  and  in the  old quarries  at 
line 48341=>Scary; so that there was a great deal better cheer that Yule than anyone had 
line 48342=>hoped for. 
line 48343=>     One of the first  things done in Hobbiton,  before even  the removal of 
line 48344=>the new mill, was the clearing of the Hill and Bag End, and the  restoration 
line 48345=>of Bagshot Row. The front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into 
line 48346=>a large sheltered garden, and new holes were dug in the southward face, back 
line 48347=>into the Hill, and they  were lined with brick. The Gaffer  was  restored to 
line 48348=>Number Three; and he said often and did not care who heard it: 
line 48349=>     'It's an  ill wind as  blows nobody no good, as I always say. And All's 
line 48350=>well as ends Better!' 
line 48351=>     There was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given. 
line 48352=>Battle  Gardens  was thought  of,  or Better  Smials.  But  after a while in 
line 48353=>sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called New Row. It was a purely  Bywater  
line 48354=>joke to refer to it as Sharkey's End. 
line 48355=>     The trees were the worst loss and damage, for at Sharkey's bidding they 
line 48356=>had been  cut down recklessly far  and wide over the Shire; and Sam  grieved 
line 48357=>over this more than anything else. For  one thing, this hurt would take long 
line 48358=>to heal, and only  his great-grandchildren, he thought,  would see the Shire 
line 48359=>as it ought to be. 
line 48360=>     Then  suddenly  one day, for he had  been too busy for  weeks to give a  
line 48361=>thought to  his adventures,   he remembered the gift of Galadriel. He brought  
line 48362=>the box  out and showed it to  the  other Travellers (for  so they were  now 
line 48363=>called by everyone), and asked their advice. 
line 48364=>     'I wondered when you would think of it,' said Frodo. 'Open it!' 
line 48365=>     Inside it was filled with a grey  dust, soft and fine, in the middle of 
line 48366=>
line 48367=>####-which was a seed, like a small nut with a  silver shale. 'What can I do with 
line 48368=>this?' said Sam. 
line 48369=>     'Throw it in the air on  a breezy day  and  let it do  its  work!' said 
line 48370=>Pippin. 
line 48371=>     'On what?' said Sam. 
line 48372=>     'Choose one spot  as  a  nursery, and  see what happens  to the  plants 
line 48373=>there,' said Merry. 
line 48374=>     'But I'm  sure  the Lady  would not like me to keep it all  for my  own 
line 48375=>garden, now so many folk have suffered,' said Sam. 
line 48376=>     'Use all the wi ts and knowledge you have of your own, Sam,' said Frodo,  
line 48377=>'and then  use the  gift to  help  your  work  and  better  it. And  use  it 
line 48378=>sparingly. There is not much here, and I expect every grain has a value.' 
line 48379=>     So Sam planted saplings in all the  places where specially beautiful or  
line 48380=>beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in 
line 48381=>the soil at the root of each. He went up and  down the Shire in this labour; 
line 48382=>but if he  paid special attention to Hobbiton and Bywater no one blamed h im. 
line 48383=>And  at  the end he found that he still had a little of the dust left; so he 
line 48384=>went to the Three-Farthing  Stone, which is as near the centre of the  Shire 
line 48385=>as no matter, and cast it  in  the air with his  blessing. The little silver  
line 48386=>nut he  planted  in the Party Field where the tree had  once  been;  and  he 
line 48387=>wondered  what would  come  of  it. All through  the winter  he remained  as 
line 48388=>patient  as  he  could,  and tried  to  restrain himself  from  going  round 
line 48389=>constantly to see if anything was happening. 
line 48390=>     Spring surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and grow, 
line 48391=>as if time was in a hurry and  wished to make one year do for twenty. In the 
line 48392=>Party Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had silver bark and long 
line 48393=>leaves and burst into golden flowers  in April. It was indeed a mallorn, and 
line 48394=>it was the wonder of the neighbourhood.  In after years, as it grew in grace 
line 48395=>and beauty, it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys 
line 48396=>to 
line 48397=>see it: the only mallorn  west of the Mountains and east of the Sea, and one 
line 48398=>of the finest in the world. 
line 48399=>     Altogether 1420 in  the Shire was a marvellous year. Not only was there 
line 48400=>wonderful sunshine and delicious rain, in due times and perfect measure, but 
line 48401=>there seemed something more: an air of richness and growth, and a gleam of a  
line 48402=>beauty  beyond  that  of  mortal summers  that flicker  and  pass  upon this 
line 48403=>Middle-earth. All the children born or begotten in that year, and there were 
line 48404=>
line 48405=>####-many, were fair to see and strong, and most of them  had a rich golden  hair 
line 48406=>that had before  been rare  among hobbits.  The fruit was so  plentiful that 
line 48407=>young  hobbits very nearly bathed in  strawberries and cream; and later they 
line 48408=>sat on the lawns under the plum-trees  and ate, until they had made piles of 
line 48409=>stones  like  small pyramids or  the  heaped skulls of a conqueror, and then 
line 48410=>they  moved on. And no  one was ill,  and everyone was pleased. except those 
line 48411=>who had to mow the grass.  
line 48412=>     In the  Southfarthing the vines were laden, and the yield of 'leaf' was 
line 48413=>astonishing; and everywhere there was  so much  corn that at  Harvest  every 
line 48414=>barn was stuffed. 'The  Northfarthing barley  was so fine  that the beer  of 
line 48415=>1420 malt was long remembered and became a byword. Indeed a generation 
line 48416=>later 
line 48417=>one might hear an  old gaffer  in an inn, aft er  a good pint  of well-earned 
line 48418=>ale,  put  down his mug with a sigh:  'Ah! that was  proper fourteen-twenty, 
line 48419=>that was!' 
line 48420=>     Sam stayed at first at  the Cottons'  with Frodo; but when  the New Row 
line 48421=>was ready he went  with the Gaffer. In addition to all his  other  labours he 
line 48422=>was  busy  directing  the cleaning up and restoring  of Bag End; but he  was 
line 48423=>often away in the Shire on his forestry work. So he was not at home in early 
line 48424=>March and did not know that  Frodo had  been ill. On the  thirteenth of that 
line 48425=>month  Farmer Cotton found Frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching  a white 
line 48426=>gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream. 
line 48427=>     'It is gone for ever,' he said, 'and now all is dark and empty.' 
line 48428=>     But the fit  passed, and  when Sam got back on  the twenty-fifth, Frodo 
line 48429=>had  recovered, and he said nothing about  himself. In the meanwhile Bag End 
line 48430=>had  been  set  in order,  and Merry and Pippin came over  from  Crickhollow 
line 48431=>bringing back  all the old furniture  and gear, so that  the  old hole  soon 
line 48432=>looked very much as it always had done. 
line 48433=>     When all was at last ready Frodo said: 'When are you  going to  move in 
line 48434=>and join me, Sam?' 
line 48435=>     Sam looked a bit awkward. 
line 48436=>     'There is no need to come yet, if you don't want to,'  said Frodo. 'But 
line 48437=>you k now the Gaffer  is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after  
line 48438=>by Widow Rumble.' 
line 48439=>     It s not that, Mr. Frodo, said Sam, and he went ver red. 
line 48440=>     'Well, what is it?' 
line 48441=>     'It's Rosie, Rose Cotton,' said Sam. 'It seems she didn't like my going 
line 48442=>
line 48443=>####-abroad at all, poor lass; but as I hadn't spoken, she couldn't say so. And I 
line 48444=>didn't speak, because I had  a job to  do first. But now I have  spoken, and 
line 48445=>she says:  "Well, you've  wasted  a year,  so why wait longer?"  "Wasted?" I  
line 48446=>says. "I wouldn't call it that." Still I see what she means. I feel torn  in 
line 48447=>two, as you might say.' 
line 48448=>     'I see,' said Frodo: 'you want to get married, and yet you want to live 
line 48449=>with me in  Bag End too? But my dear  Sam, how easy! Get  married as soon as 
line 48450=>you  can, and then move in with Rosie. There's room enough in Bag End for as 
line 48451=>big a family as you could wish for.' 
line 48452=>     And so it was settled. Sam Gamgee married Rose Cotton in the Spring  of 
line 48453=>1420 (which was  also famous  for its weddings), and they came and lived  at 
line 48454=>Bag End. And if Sam thought himself lucky, Frodo knew that he was more 
line 48455=>lucky 
line 48456=>himself; for there was not a hobbit in the  Shire that was looked after with 
line 48457=>such care. When the labours of repair  had all been planned and set going he 
line 48458=>took to a quiet life, writing a great dea l and  going through all his notes. 
line 48459=>He resigned the office of Deputy Mayor at the Free Fair that mid-summer, and 
line 48460=>dear old Will Whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at Banquets.  
line 48461=>     Merry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow, and  there 
line 48462=>was  much coming  and  going between  Buckland and Bag  End.  The two  
line 48463=>young 
line 48464=>Travellers cut a great  dash in the Shire  with  their songs and their tales 
line 48465=>and their finery,  and  their wonderful  parties. 'Lordly' folk called them, 
line 48466=>meaning nothing bu t good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go  riding by 
line 48467=>with their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and 
line 48468=>singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent,  they  
line 48469=>were unchanged otherwise, unless they were  indeed  more fairspoken and 
line 48470=>more 
line 48471=>jovial and full of merriment than ever before. 
line 48472=>     Frodo and Sam, however, went back to ordinary attire,  except that when 
line 48473=>there was need they both wore long grey cloaks,  finely woven and clasped at 
line 48474=>the throat with beautiful brooches; and Mr. Frodo wore always a  white jewel 
line 48475=>on a chain that he often would finger. 
line 48476=>     All things now went well, with  hope always of becoming  still  better; 
line 48477=>and Sam  was  as busy and as  full of delight as even a hobbit  could  wish. 
line 48478=>Nothing  for him marred that whole year, except  for some vague anxiety about 
line 48479=>his  master. Frodo dropped quietly  out of all the doings of the  Shire, and 
line 48480=>
line 48481=>####-Sam was  pained to notice how little  honour he  had in his own country. Few 
line 48482=>people  knew  or  wanted  to  know about  his  deeds and  adventures;  their 
line 48483=>admiration  and  respect were given mostly  to Mr. Meriadoc and Mr. Peregrin 
line 48484=>and (if Sam had known it) to himself. Also in  the  autumn there appeared  a  
line 48485=>shadow of old troubles.  
line 48486=>     One evening Sam came into the  study and  found his master looking very 
line 48487=>strange. He was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away. 
line 48488=>     'What's the matter, Mr. Frodo?' said Sam. 
line 48489=>     'I am wounded,' he answered, 'wounded; it will never really heal.' 
line 48490=>     But then  he  got   up, and the  turn seemed to  pass, and he  was quite 
line 48491=>himself the next day. It was not until afterwards that Sam recalled that the 
line 48492=>date  was October the sixth. Two years before on that day it was dark in the 
line 48493=>dell under Weathertop. 
line 48494=>     Time went on, and 1421 came  in. Frodo was ill again in March, but with 
line 48495=>a great effort he concealed it, for Sam had other things to think about. The 
line 48496=>first of  Sam and Rosie's children was born on the twenty-fifth of  March, a  
line 48497=>date that Sam noted. 
line 48498=>     'Well,  Mr. Frodo,' he said. 'I'm in a bit of  a fix.  Rose  and me had 
line 48499=>settled  to  call him Frodo, with  your leave; but it's  not  him , it's her. 
line 48500=>Though as pretty a maidchild  as any one  could hope for, taking after  Rose 
line 48501=>more than me, luckily. So we don't know what to do.' 
line 48502=>     'Well,  Sam,' said Frodo,  'what's wrong with the old customs? Choose a  
line 48503=>flower name like Rose. Half the maidchildren in the Shire are called by such  
line 48504=>names, and what could be better?' 
line 48505=>     'I  suppose  you're  right,  Mr.  Frodo,'  said  Sam.  'I've heard some 
line 48506=>beautiful names on my travels,  but  I  suppose they're  a bit too grand for 
line 48507=>daily wear and tear, as you  might say. The Gaffer, he says: "Make it short, 
line 48508=>and  then you won't have to cut it short before you can use it." But if it's 
line 48509=>to be a  flower-name, then I don't  trouble about  the length: it  must be a  
line 48510=>beautiful  flower, because, you see, I  think  she is very beautiful, and is 
line 48511=>going to be beautifuller still.' 
line 48512=>     Frodo  thought  for  a  moment.  'Well,  Sam,  what  about  elanor, the 
line 48513=>sun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of Lothlurien?' 
line 48514=>     'You're  right  again, Mr. Frodo!' said  Sam delighted.  'That's what I 
line 48515=>wanted.' 
line 48516=>     Little  Elanor  was nearly six months  old, and 1421  had passed to its 
line 48517=>autumn, when Frodo called Sam into the study. 
line 48518=>
line 48519=>####-     'It will be Bilbo's Birthday on Thursday, Sam,'  he  said. 'And he will 
line 48520=>pass the Old Took. He will be a hundred and thirty-one!' 
line 48521=>     'So he will!' said Sam. 'He's a marvel!' 
line 48522=>     'Well,  Sam,' said Frodo. 'I want you to see Rose  and  find out if she 
line 48523=>can spare  you, so that you and I can go off together.  You can't go  far or  
line 48524=>for a long time now, of course,' he said a little wistfully. 
line 48525=>     'Well, not very well, Mr. Frodo.' 
line 48526=>     'Of course not.  But never mind.  You can see me on my way.  Tell  Rose 
line 48527=>that you won't be away very long, not more than a fortnight; and you'll come  
line 48528=>back quite safe.' 
line 48529=>     'I wish I could go all  the way  with  you to Rivendell, Mr. Frodo, and 
line 48530=>see Mr. Bilbo,' said Sam. 'And yet the only place I really want to  be in is 
line 48531=>here. I am that torn in two.' 
line 48532=>     'Poor Sam! It will feel like that, I am  afraid,'  said Frodo. 'But you  
line 48533=>will be healed. You were meant to be solid and whole, and you will be.' 
line 48534=>     In the next day or  two Frodo went through his papers and  his writings 
line 48535=>with Sam, and he handed over his keys.  There was  a big book with plain red 
line 48536=>leather  covers; its  tall  pages were  now almost filled.  At the beginning 
line 48537=>there were many leaves covered with Bilbo's thin wandering hand; but most of 
line 48538=>it was written in Frodo's firm flowing script.  It was divided into chapters 
line 48539=>but  Chapter 80 was unfinished, and after that  were some  blank leaves. The 
line 48540=>title page had many titles on it, crossed out one after another, so: 
line 48541=> 
line 48542=>     My  Diary. My Unexpected  Journey.  There  and  Back  Again.  And  What 
line 48543=>Happened After. 
line 48544=>     Adventures of  Five  Hobbits. The Tale  of the Great  Ring, compiled by 
line 48545=>Bilbo  Baggins from his own  observations  and the  accounts of his friends. 
line 48546=>What we did in the War of the Ring. 
line 48547=>     Here Bilbo's hand ended and Frodo had written: 
line 48548=> 
line 48549=>     THE DOWNFALL 
line 48550=>     OF THE 
line 48551=>     LORD OF THE RINGS 
line 48552=>     AND THE 
line 48553=>     RETURN OF THE KING 
line 48554=> 
line 48555=>     (as seen by the Little People; being the memoirs  of Bilbo and Frodo of 
line 48556=>
line 48557=>####-the Shire, supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of 
line 48558=>the Wise.) 
line 48559=>     Together  with  extracts from  Books of  Lore  translated by  Bilbo  in 
line 48560=>Rivendell. 
line 48561=>     'Why, you  have  nearly finished  it, Mr. Frodo!' Sam exclaimed. 'Well, 
line 48562=>you have kept at it, I must say.' 
line 48563=>     'I have quite finished, Sam,' said Frodo. 'The last pages are for you.' 
line 48564=>     On September the twenty-first  they set out together, Frodo on the pony 
line 48565=>that  had  borne him  all the  way  from  Minas  Tirith, and was  now called 
line 48566=>Strider; and Sam on his beloved Bill. It  was a fair golden morning, and Sam 
line 48567=>did not ask where they were going: he thought he could guess. 
line 48568=>     They took the Stock Road over the hills and went towards the Woody End, 
line 48569=>and they let their ponies walk  at their leisure.  They camped  in the Green 
line 48570=>Hills,  and  on September the twenty-second  they rode gently down  into the 
line 48571=>beginning of the trees as afternoon was wearing away. 
line 48572=>     'If that isn't the very tree you hid  behind when the Black Rider first 
line 48573=>showed up, Mr. Frodo!' said Sam pointing to the left. 'It seems like a dream 
line 48574=>now.' 
line 48575=>     It  was  evening, and the stars were glimmering  in the  eastern sky as 
line 48576=>they passed the ruined oak and turned and went on  down the hill between the 
line 48577=>hazel-thickets. Sam  was  silent,  deep in his memories. Presently he became 
line 48578=>aware   that  Frodo  was  singing  softly  to  himself,   singing   the  old 
line 48579=>walking-song, but the words were not quite the same. 
line 48580=>     Still round the corner there may wait 
line 48581=>     A new road or a secret gate; 
line 48582=>     And though I oft have passed them by, 
line 48583=>     A day will come at last when I 
line 48584=>     Shall take the hidden paths that run 
line 48585=>     West of the Moon, East of the Sun. 
line 48586=>     And  as if in answer,  from down below,  coming up the road out of  the 
line 48587=>valley, voices sang: 
line 48588=>     A! Elbereth Gilthoniel! 
line 48589=>     silivren penna mnriel 
line 48590=>     o menel aglar elenath, 
line 48591=>     Gilthoniel, A! Elbereth! 
line 48592=>     We still remember, we who dwell 
line 48593=>     In this far land beneath the trees 
line 48594=>
line 48595=>####-     The starlight on the Western Seas. 
line 48596=>     Frodo and Sam halted and sat silent in the soft shadows, until they saw 
line 48597=>a shimmer as the travellers came towards them. 
line 48598=>     There was Gildor  and  many fair Elven folk; and there  to Sam's wonder  
line 48599=>rode Elrond and Galadriel. Elrond wore a  mantle of grey and had a star upon 
line 48600=>his forehead, and  a silver harp was in his  hand, and upon his finger was a  
line 48601=>ring of gold with a  great blue stone, Vilya, mightiest of  the  Three.  But 
line 48602=>Galadriel sat upon a white palfrey  and  was robed all in glimmering  white,  
line 48603=>like  clouds  about the Moon; for  she herself seemed  to shine with a  soft 
line 48604=>light.  On  her  finger was Nenya, the ring wrought of mithril ,  that bore a  
line 48605=>single white stone  flickering like a frosty star. Riding slowly behind on a  
line 48606=>small grey pony, and seeming to nod in his sleep, was Bilbo himself. 
line 48607=>     Elrond greeted  them gravely and graciously, and Galadriel  smiled upon  
line 48608=>them. 'Well, Master Samwise,'  she said.  'I hear and see that you have used 
line 48609=>my  gift well. The Shire shall now be  more than ever blessed  and beloved.' 
line 48610=>Sam bowed, but found nothing to say. He had forgotten how beautiful the Lady 
line 48611=>was. 
line 48612=>     Then Bilbo woke up and opened his eyes. 'Hullo, Frodo!' he said. 'Well, 
line 48613=>I have passed the  Old Took today! So that's  settled. And now I think I  am 
line 48614=>quite ready to go on another journey. Are you coming?' 
line 48615=>     'Yes, I am coming,' said Frodo. 'The Ring-bearers should go together.' 
line 48616=>     'Where are you going, Master?' cried Sam, though at last he  understood 
line 48617=>what was happening. 
line 48618=>     'To the Havens, Sam,' said Frodo. 
line 48619=>     'And I can't come.' 
line 48620=>     'No, Sam. Not yet anyway, not  further  than the Havens. Though you too 
line 48621=>were a Ring-bearer, if only  for a little while. Your  time may come. Do not 
line 48622=>be too  sad, Sam. You cannot be always torn in two. You will  have to be one 
line 48623=>and whole, for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.' 
line 48624=>     'But,' said  Sam, and tears started  in his eyes, 'I  thought  you were 
line 48625=>going  to  enjoy the  Shire, too.  for years and  years, after all you  have 
line 48626=>done.' 
line 48627=>     'So I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, Sam. I  tried 
line 48628=>to  save the Shire, and it has been saved, but not  for me. It must often be 
line 48629=>so, Sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, 
line 48630=>so that others may keep them. But you are my  heir: all that I had and might  
line 48631=>have had I leave to you.  And also you  have Rose, and Elanor; and Frodo -lad 
line 48632=>
line 48633=>####-will  come,  and  Rosie-lass,  and Merry, and  Goldilocks,  and Pippin;  and 
line 48634=>perhaps more  that I  cannot see. Your  hands and  your wits will  be needed 
line 48635=>everywhere. You will be the Mayor, of course, as long a s you want to be, and 
line 48636=>the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red 
line 48637=>Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone. so that people will  
line 48638=>remember the Great Danger and so love their beloved land all the  more.  And 
line 48639=>that will  keep  you as busy and as  happy as anyone can be, as long as your 
line 48640=>part of the Story goes on. 
line 48641=>     'Come now, ride with me!' 
line 48642=>     Then Elrond and  Galadriel rode on; for the Third Age was over, and the  
line 48643=>Days of the Rings were passed, and an end was come of the story and  song of 
line 48644=>those  times. With them  went many  Elves of the High Kindred  who  would 
line 48645=>no 
line 48646=>longer stay in  Middle-earth; and among them, filled with a sadness that was 
line 48647=>yet  blessed and without bitterness, rode Sam, and Frodo, and Bilbo, and the 
line 48648=>Elves delighted to honour them. 
line 48649=>     Though they rode through the midst of the Shire all the evening and all 
line 48650=>the night, none saw them  pass,  save the wild creatures; or here  and there 
line 48651=>some wanderer in the dark who saw a swift  shimmer  under  the trees,  or  a  
line 48652=>light and shadow flowing  through the grass as the Moon  went westward.  And 
line 48653=>when  they had passed from the  Shire,  going about the  south skirts of the 
line 48654=>White Downs, they came to the Far Downs,  and to the Towers,  and  looked on 
line 48655=>the  distant Sea; and  so they  rode down at  last to Mithlond,  to the Grey 
line 48656=>Havens in the long firth of Lune. 
line 48657=>     As  they  came  to the gates Cnrdan the Shipwright came  forth to greet 
line 48658=>them. Very tall he was,  and his beard  was long, and he  was grey  and old, 
line 48659=>save that  his eyes were keen as stars; and he looked at them and bowed, and  
line 48660=>said: 'All is now ready.' 
line 48661=>     Then Cnrdan led  them to the Havens, and there  was a white ship lying, 
line 48662=>and upon the  quay  beside a  great  grey horse stood a  figure robed all in 
line 48663=>white awaiting them.  As  he turned and came  towards  them  Frodo saw  that 
line 48664=>Gandalf now wore openly  upon his  hand the Third Ring, Narya the Great, and 
line 48665=>the stone upon it was red as fire.  Then those who were to go were glad, for  
line 48666=>they knew that Gandalf also would take ship with them. 
line 48667=>     But Sam  was now sorrowful at  heart,  and it seemed to him that if the 
line 48668=>parting would be bitter,  more grievous  still would  be  the long road home 
line 48669=>alone. But  even as they stood there, and the Elves were  going aboard,  and 
line 48670=>
line 48671=>####-all was being made ready to depart, up rode Merry and Pippin in great haste.  
line 48672=>And amid his tears Pippin laughed. 
line 48673=>     'You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo.' he said. 
line 48674=>'This time you have nearly  succeeded, but you have failed again. It was not  
line 48675=>Sam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf himself!' 
line 48676=>     'Yes,' said Gandalf; 'for it will be better to ride back three together  
line 48677=>'than one alone. Well, here at  last, dear friends, on the shores of the Sea  
line 48678=>comes the end of our fellowship in Middle-earth.  Go in peace!  I  will  not 
line 48679=>say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.' 
line 48680=>     Then Frodo  kissed Merry  and Pippin,  and last  of all  Sam,  and went 
line 48681=>aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and  the wind blew, and slowly the ship 
line 48682=>slipped away  down  the  long  grey firth;  and the  light of  the  glass of 
line 48683=>Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into 
line 48684=>the  High Sea and passed on into the West, until at  last on a night of rain 
line 48685=>Frodo smelled  a sweet  fragrance on the air  and heard the sound of singing  
line 48686=>that came over the water. And  then it seemed to him that as in his dream in 
line 48687=>the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver  glass and  
line 48688=>was  rolled back, and he beheld white  shores and beyond  them  a far  green 
line 48689=>country under a swift sunrise. 
line 48690=>     But to Sam  the evening deepened to darkness as he  stood at the Haven; 
line 48691=>and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was 
line 48692=>soon lost in the West. There still he stood  far into the night, hearing only 
line 48693=>the  sigh and murmur of  the  waves on  the shores  of Middle-earth, and the 
line 48694=>sound of them sank deep into his  heart.  Beside him stood Merry and Pippin, 
line 48695=>and they were silent. 
line 48696=>     At last the three companions  turned away, and never again looking back  
line 48697=>they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to one another until they 
line 48698=>came  back to the  Shire. but each had great comfort  in his friends  on the 
line 48699=>long grey road. 
line 48700=>     At last they rode over the downs and took the East Road, and then Merry 
line 48701=>and Pippin rode on to Buckland; and already they  were singing again as they 
line 48702=>went. But Sam turned to Bywater,  and so came back up  the Hill,  as day was 
line 48703=>ending  once  more. And  he  went on, and there  was  yellow light, and fire 
line 48704=>within; and the evening meal was ready, and he  was expected.  And Rose drew 
line 48705=>him in, and set him in his chair, and put little Elanor upon his lap. 
line 48706=>     He drew a deep breath. 'Well, I'm back,' he said. 
line 48707=>
