line 1=>In this reprint several minor inaccuracies, most of them noted by readers, have been corrected. For example, the rune text now corresponds exactly with the runes on  Thror's  Map.  More  important  is  the  matter  of  Chapter  Five.  There  the  true  story  of  the  ending  of  the  Riddle  Game,  as  it  was  eventually  revealed  (under  pressure)  by Bilbo  to Gandalf,  is  now  given  according  to  the Red Book,  in  place  of  the  version  Bilbo  first  gave  to  his  friends,  and  actually  set  down  in  his  diary. This  departure  from  truth  on  the  part  of  a  most  honest  hobbit  was  a  portent  of great  significance.  It  does  not,  however,  concern  the  present  story,  and  those who in this edition make their first acquaintance with hobbit-lore need not troupe about it.  Its  explanation  lies in the history of the Ring, as it was set out in the chronicles of the Red Book of Westmarch, and is now told in The Lord of the Rings.

line 3=>A final note may be added, on a point raised by several students of  the  lore of 
line 4=>the  period.  On  Thror's  Map  is  written  Here  of  old  was  Thrain  King  under  the 
line 5=>Mountain;  yet  Thrain  was  the  son  of  Thror,  the  last  King  under  the  Mountain 
line 6=>before  the  coming  of  the  dragon.  The  Map,  however,  is  not  in  error.  Names  are 
line 7=>often  repeated  in  dynasties,  and  the  genealogies  show  that  a  distant  ancestor  of 
line 8=>Thror  was  referred  to,  Thrain  I,  a  fugitive  from  Moria,  who  first  discovered  the 
line 9=>Lonely Mountain, Erebor, and ruled there for a while, before his people moved on 
line 10=>to the remoter mountains of the North.

line 14=>An Unexpected Party
line 15=>
line 16=>In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with 
line 17=>the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing 
line 18=>in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. 
line 19=>It  had  a  perfectly  round  door  like  a  porthole,  painted  green,  with  a  shiny 
line 20=>yellow  brass  knob  in  the  exact middle. The  door  opened  on  to  a  tube-shaped hall 
line 21=>like  a  tunnel:  a  very  comfortable  tunnel without  smoke, with  panelled walls,  and 
line 22=>floors  tiled  and  carpeted,  provided with  polished  chairs,  and  lots  and  lots of pegs 
line 23=>for  hats  and  coats - the hobbit was  fond of visitors. The  tunnel wound on  and on, 
line 24=>going  fairly  but  not  quite  straight  into  the  side  of  the  hill  -  The  Hill,  as  all  the 
line 25=>people for many miles round called  it - and many little round doors opened out of 
line 26=>it,  first  on  one  side  and  then  on  another.  No  going  upstairs  for  the  hobbit: 
line 27=>bedrooms,  bathrooms,  cellars,  pantries  (lots  of  these),  wardrobes  (he  had  whole 
line 28=>rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and 
line 29=>indeed  on  the  same  passage. The  best  rooms were  all  on  the  left-hand side (going 
line 30=>in),  for  these  were  the  only  ones  to  have  windows,  deep-set  round  windows 
line 31=>looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river.  
line 32=>This  hobbit  was  a  very  well-to-do  hobbit,  and  his  name  was  Baggins.  The 
line 33=>Bagginses  had  lived  in  the  neighbourhood  of  The  Hill  for  time  out  of mind,  and 
line 34=>people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, 
line 35=>but  also  because  they  never had  any  adventures or did  anything unexpected: you 
line 36=>could tell what a Baggins would say on any question without the bother of asking 
line 37=>him. This  is a story of how a Baggins had an adventure,  found himself doing and 
line 38=>saying things altogether unexpected. He may have lost the neighbours' respect, but 
line 39=>he gained-well, you will see whether he gained anything in the end.
line 40=>The  mother  of  our  particular  hobbit  …  what  is  a  hobbit?  I  suppose  hobbits 
line 41=>need  some description nowadays,  since  they have become  rare  and  shy of the Big 
line 42=>People,  as  they  call  us.  They  are  (or  were)  a  little  people,  about  half  our  height, 
line 43=>and  smaller  than  the  bearded Dwarves. Hobbits  have  no  beards. There  is  little  or 
line 44=>no  magic  about  them,  except  the  ordinary  everyday  sort  which  helps  them  to 
line 45=>disappear  quietly  and  quickly  when  large  stupid  folk  like  you  and  me  come 
line 46=>blundering  along,  making  a  noise  like  elephants  which  they  can  hear  a  mile  off. 
line 47=>They  are  inclined  to  be    at  in  the  stomach;  they  dress  in  bright  colours  (chiefly 
line 48=>
line 49=>####-green  and  yellow);  wear  no  shoes,  because  their  feet  grow  natural  leathery  soles 
line 50=>and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads (which is curly); have long 
line 51=>clever brown fingers, good-natured faces, and laugh deep fruity laughs (especially 
line 52=>after  dinner,  which  they  have  twice  a  day when  they  can  get  it). Now  you  know 
line 53=>enough  to  go  on  with.  As  I  was  saying,  the  mother  of  this  hobbit  -  of  Bilbo 
line 54=>Baggins, that is  - was  the fabulous Belladonna Took, one of  the  three remarkable 
line 55=>daughters  of  the  Old  Took,  head  of  the  hobbits  who  lived  across  The Water,  the 
line 56=>small river that ran at the foot of The Hill. It was often said (in other families) that 
line 57=>long  ago  one  of  the  Took  ancestors  must  have  taken  a  fairy  wife.  That  was,  of 
line 58=>course,  absurd,  but  certainly  there  was  still  something  not  entirely  hobbit-like 
line 59=>about  them,  -  and  once  in  a while members  of  the  Took-clan would go and have 
line 60=>adventures. They discreetly disappeared, and  the  family hushed  it up; but  the  fact 
line 61=>remained  that  the  Tooks  were  not  as  respectable  as  the  Bagginses,  though  they 
line 62=>were undoubtedly richer. Not that Belladonna Took ever had any adventures after 
line 63=>she  became  Mrs.  Bungo  Baggins.  Bungo,  that  was  Bilbo's  father,  built  the  most 
line 64=>luxurious  hobbit-hole  for  her  (and  partly  with  her  money)  that  was  to  be  found 
line 65=>either  under  The  Hill  or  over  The  Hill  or  across  The  Water,  and  there  they 
line 66=>remained  to  the  end  of  their  days.  Still  it  is  probable  that  Bilbo,  her  only  son, 
line 67=>although  he  looked  and  behaved  exactly  like  a  second  edition  of  his  solid  and 
line 68=>comfortable  father,  got  something  a  bit  queer  in  his makeup  from  the Took  side, 
line 69=>something  that  only  waited  for  a  chance  to  come  out.  The  chance  never  arrived, 
line 70=>until Bilbo Baggins was grown up, being about fifty years old or so, and living in 
line 71=>the  beautiful  hobbit-hole  built  by  his  father,  which  I  have  just described  for you, 
line 72=>until he had in fact apparently settled down immovably.  
line 73=>By some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world, when 
line 74=>there  was  less  noise  and  more  green,  and  the  hobbits  were  still  numerous  and 
line 75=>prosperous,  and  Bilbo  Baggins  was  standing  at  his  door  after  breakfast  smoking 
line 76=>an  enormous  long  wooden  pipe  that  reached  nearly  down  to  his  woolly  toes 
line 77=>(neatly brushed)  - Gandalf  came  by. Gandalf!  If  you  had  heard  only  a  quarter  of 
line 78=>what  I  have  heard  about  him,  and  I  have  only  heard  very  little  of  all  there  is  to 
line 79=>hear,  you  would  be  prepared  for  any  sort  I  of  remarkable  tale.  Tales  and 
line 80=>adventures  sprouted  up  all  over  the  place  wherever  he  went,  in  the  most 
line 81=>extraordinary  fashion.  He  had  not  been  down  that  way  under  The  Hill  for  ages 
line 82=>and  ages,  not  since  his  friend  the  Old  Took  died,  in  fact,  and  the  hobbits  had 
line 83=>almost forgotten what he looked like. He had been away over The Hill and across 
line 84=>The  Water  on  business  of  his  own  since  they  were  all  small  hobbit-boys  and 
line 85=>hobbit-girls. 
line 86=>
line 87=>####-All that the unsuspecting Bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff. 
line 88=>He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white 
line 89=>beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots. 
line 90=>"Good  morning!"  said  Bilbo,  and  he  meant  it.  The  sun  was  shining,  and  the 
line 91=>grass was very green. But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows 
line 92=>that  stuck  out  further  than  the  brim  of  his  shady  hat.  "What  do  you  mean?"  be 
line 93=>said. "Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether 
line 94=>I  want  not;  or  that  you  feel  good  this  morning;  or  that  it  is  morning  to  be  good 
line 95=>on?" 
line 96=>"All  of  them  at  once,"  said  Bilbo.  "And  a  very  fine  morning  for  a  pipe  of 
line 97=>tobacco out of doors, into the bargain. If you have a pipe about you, sit down  and 
line 98=>have  a  fill of mine! There's no hurry, we have  all  the day before us!" Then Bilbo 
line 99=>sat down on a seat by his door, crossed his legs, and blew out a beautiful grey ring 
line 100=>of  smoke  that  sailed  up  into  the  air without  breaking  and  floated  away  over  The 
line 101=>Hill. 
line 102=>"Very  pretty!"  said  Gandalf.  "But  I  have  no  time  to  blow  smoke-rings  this 
line 103=>morning.  I  am  looking  for  someone  to  share  in  an  adventure  that  I  am  arranging, 
line 104=>and it's very difficult to find anyone." 
line 105=>«I should think so  - in these parts! We are plain quiet folk and have no use for 
line 106=>adventures.  Nasty  .disturbing  uncomfortable  things! Make  you  late  for  dinner!  I 
line 107=>can’t  think  what  anybody  sees  in  them,»  said  our  Mr.  Baggins,  and  stuck  one 
line 108=>thumb  behind  his  braces,  and  blew  out  another  even  bigger  smoke-ring. Then he 
line 109=>took out his morning  letters, and begin  to  read, pretending  to  take no more notice 
line 110=>of  the old man. He had decided  that he was not quite his  sort,  and wanted him  to 
line 111=>go away. But  the old man did not move. He stood  leaning on his stick and gazing 
line 112=>at the hobbit without saying anything, till Bilbo got quite uncomfortable and even 
line 113=>a little cross. 
line 114=>"Good  morning!"  he  said  at  last.  "We  don't  want  any  adventures  here,  thank 
line 115=>you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the 
line 116=>conversation was at an end. 
line 117=>"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you 
line 118=>mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off." 
line 119=>"Not  at  all,  not  at  all,  my  dear  sir!  Let  me  see,  I  don't  think  I  know  your 
line 120=>name?" 
line 121=>"Yes,  yes,  my  dear  sir  -  and  I  do  know  your  name, Mr.  Bilbo  Baggins.  And 
line 122=>you  do  know  my  name,  though  you  don't  remember  that  I  belong  to  it.  I  am 
line 123=>
line 124=>####-Gandalf,  and  Gandalf  means  me!  To  think  that  I  should  have  lived  to  be  good-
line 125=>morninged by Belladonna Took's son, as if I was selling buttons at the door!" 
line 126=>"Gandalf,  Gandalf!  Good  gracious  me!  Not  the  wandering  wizard  that  gave 
line 127=>Old Took a pair of magic diamond studs that fastened themselves and never came 
line 128=>undone  till  ordered?  Not  the  fellow  who  used  to  tell  such  wonderful  tales  at 
line 129=>parties, about dragons and goblins and giants and  the rescue of princesses and  the 
line 130=>unexpected  luck  of  widows'  sons?  Not  the  man  that  used  to  make  such 
line 131=>particularly  excellent  fireworks!  I  remember  those!  Old  Took  used  to  have  them 
line 132=>on  Midsummer's  Eve.  Splendid!  They  used  to  go  up  like  great  lilies  and 
line 133=>snapdragons and laburnums of fire and hang in the twilight all evening!" You will 
line 134=>notice already that Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe, also 
line 135=>that  he was  very  fond  of  flowers. "Dear me!" she went on. "Not  the Gandalf who 
line 136=>was  responsible  for so many quiet  lads and  lasses going off  into  the Blue  for mad 
line 137=>adventures.  Anything  from  climbing  trees  to  visiting  Elves  -  or  sailing  in  ships, 
line 138=>sailing  to other  shores! Bless me,  life used  to be quite  inter  - I mean, you used  to 
line 139=>upset things badly in these parts once upon a time. I beg your pardon, but I had no 
line 140=>idea you were still in business." 
line 141=>"Where else  should  I be?"  said  the wizard.  "All  the  same  I am pleased  to  find 
line 142=>you  remember  something about me. You seem  to  remember my  fireworks kindly, 
line 143=>at any  rate,  land  that  is not without hope.  Indeed  for your old grand-father Took's 
line 144=>sake, and for the sake of poor Belladonna, I will give you what you asked for." 
line 145=>"I beg your pardon, I haven't asked for anything!" 
line 146=>"Yes, you have! Twice now. My pardon. I give it you. In fact I will go so far as 
line 147=>to  send  you  on  this  adventure.  Very  amusing  for  me,  very  good  for  you  and 
line 148=>profitable too, very likely, if you ever get over it." 
line 149=>"Sorry!  I  don't  want  any  adventures,  thank  you.  Not  today.  Good  morning! 
line 150=>But please come to tea - any time you like! Why not tomorrow? Come tomorrow! 
line 151=>Good-bye!" 
line 152=>With  that  the hobbit  turned and  scuttled  inside his  round green door, and  shut 
line 153=>it as quickly as he dared, not to seen rude. Wizards after all are wizards. 
line 154=>"What on earth did I ask him to tea for!" he said to him-self, as he went to the 
line 155=>pantry. He had only  just had break  fast, but he  thought a cake or  two and a drink 
line 156=>of  something  would  do  him  good  after  his  fright.  Gandalf  in  the  meantime  was 
line 157=>still  standing  outside  the  door,  and  laughing  long  but  quietly.  After  a  while  he 
line 158=>stepped  up,  and  with  the  spike  of  his  staff  scratched  a  queer  sign  on  the  hobbit's 
line 159=>beautiful  green  front-door.  Then  he  strode  away,  just  about  the  time  when  Bilbo 
line 160=>
line 161=>####-was  finishing  his  second  cake  and  beginning  to  think  that  he  had  escape 
line 162=>adventures very well. 
line 163=>The  next  day  he  had  almost  forgotten  about  Gandalf  He  did  not  remember 
line 164=>things  very  well,  unless  he  put  them  down  on  his  Engagement  Tablet:  like  this: 
line 165=>Gandalf ’¥a Wednesday. Yesterday he had been too flustered to do anything of the 
line 166=>kind. Just before tea-time there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell, and 
line 167=>then he remembered! He rushed and put on the kettle, and put out another cup and 
line 168=>saucer and an extra cake or two, and ran to the door.  
line 169=>"I am so sorry  to keep you waiting!" he was going  to say, when he saw  that  it 
line 170=>was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, 
line 171=>and  very  bright  eyes  under  his  dark-green hood.  As  soon a  the door was opened, 
line 172=>he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected. 
line 173=>He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and "Dwalin at your service!" he 
line 174=>said with a low bow.  
line 175=>"Bilbo  Baggins  at  yours!"  said  the  hobbit,  too  surprised  to  ask  any  questions 
line 176=>for  the  moment.  When  the  silence  that  followed  had  become  uncomfortable,  he 
line 177=>added:  "I  am  just  about  to  take  tea;  pray  come  and  have  some with me." A  little 
line 178=>stiff  perhaps,  but  he  meant  it  kindly.  And  what  would  you  do,  if  an  uninvited 
line 179=>dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation? 
line 180=>They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, 
line 181=>when there came another even louder ring at the bell. 
line 182=>"Excuse me!" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door.  
line 183=>"So  you  have  got  here  at  last!" was what  he was  going  to  say  to Gandalf  this 
line 184=>time.  But  it  was  not  Gandalf.  Instead  there  was  a  very  old-looking  dwarf  on  the 
line 185=>step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the 
line 186=>door was open, just as if he had been invited. 
line 187=>"I  see  they  have  begun  to  arrive  already,"  he  said  when  he  caught  sight  of 
line 188=>Dwalin's  green  hood  hanging  up.  He  hung  his  red  one  next  to  it,  and  "Balin  at 
line 189=>your service!" he said with his hand on his breast. 
line 190=>"Thank  you!"  said  Bilbo with  a  gasp.  It was  not  the  correct  thing  to  say,  but 
line 191=>they have begun  to  arrive had  flustered him badly. He  liked visitors, but he  liked 
line 192=>to know  them before  they arrived, and he preferred  to ask  them himself. He had a 
line 193=>horrible  thought  that  the  cakes might  run  short,  and  then  he-as  the host: he knew 
line 194=>his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without. 
line 195=>"Come  along  in,  and  have  some  tea!"  he  managed  to  say  after  taking  a  deep 
line 196=>breath. 
line 197=>
line 198=>####-"A  little  beer  would  suit  me  better,  if  it  is  all  the  same  to  you, my  good  sir," 
line 199=>said  Balin  with  the  white  beard.  "But  I  don't  mind  some  cake-seed-cake,  if  you 
line 200=>have any." 
line 201=>"Lots!"  Bilbo  found  himself  answering,  to  his  own  surprise;  and  he  found 
line 202=>himself  scuttling  off,  too,  to  the  cellar  to  fill  a  pint  beer-mug, and to the pantry to 
line 203=>fetch  two  beautiful  round  seed-cakes  which  he  had  baked  that  afternoon  for  his 
line 204=>after-supper morsel. 
line 205=>When he got back Balin and Dwalin were  talking at  the  table  like old  friends 
line 206=>(as  a  matter  of  fact  they  were  brothers).  Bilbo  plumped  down  the  beer  and  the 
line 207=>cake  in  front  of  them, when  loud  came  a  ring  at  the  bell  again,  and  then  another 
line 208=>ring. 
line 209=>"Gandalf for certain this time," he thought as he puffed along the passage. But 
line 210=>it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow 
line 211=>beards;  and  each  of  them  carried  a  bag  of  tools  and  a  spade.  In  they  hopped,  as 
line 212=>soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all. 
line 213=>"What can I do for you, my dwarves?" he said. "Kili at your service!" said the 
line 214=>one.  "And  Fili!"  added  the  other;  and  they  both  swept  off  their  blue  hoods  and 
line 215=>bowed. 
line 216=>"At  yours  and  your  family's!"  replied  Bilbo,  remembering  his  manners  this 
line 217=>time. 
line 218=>"Dwalin and Balin here already, I see," said Kili. "Let us join the throng!" 
line 219=>"Throng!" thought Mr. Baggins. "I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit 
line 220=>down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink." He had only just had a 
line 221=>sip-in  the  corner,  while  the  four  dwarves  sat  around  the  table,  and  talked  about 
line 222=>mines  and  gold  and  troubles  with  the  goblins,  and  the  depredations  of  dragons, 
line 223=>and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they 
line 224=>sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, 
line 225=>as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. "Someone at 
line 226=>the  door!"  he  said,  blinking.  "Some  four,  I  should  say  by  the  sound,"  said  Fili. 
line 227=>"Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance." 
line 228=>The  poor  little  hobbit  sat  down  in  the  hall  and  put  his  head  in  his  hands,  and 
line 229=>wondered  what  had  happened,  and  what  was  going  to  happen,  and  whether  they 
line 230=>would all stay  to supper. Then  the bell rang again  louder  than ever, and he had  to 
line 231=>run  to  the  door.  It  was  not  four  after  all,  t  was  FIVE.  Another  dwarf  had  come 
line 232=>along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re 
line 233=>they were all  inside, bowing and  saying  "at your  service" one after another. Dori, 
line 234=>Nori,  Ori,  Oin,  and  Gloin  were  their  names;  and  very  soon  two  purple  hoods,  a 
line 235=>
line 236=>####-grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they 
line 237=>marched  with  their  broad  hands  stuck  in  their  gold  and  silver  belts  to  join  the 
line 238=>others. Already  it had almost become a  throng. Some called  for ale, and some  for 
line 239=>porter,  and  one  for  coffee,  and  all  of  them  for  cakes;  so  the hobbit was kept very 
line 240=>busy for a while. 
line 241=>A  big  jug  of  coffee  bad  just  been  set  in  the  hearth,  the  seed-cakes were gone, 
line 242=>and  the  dwarves  were  starting  on  a  round  of  buttered  scones,  when  there  came-a 
line 243=>loud  knock.  Not  a  ring,  but  a  hard  rat-tat  on  the  hobbit's  beautiful  green  door. 
line 244=>Somebody was banging with a stick! 
line 245=>Bilbo  rushed  along  the  passage,  very  angry,  and  altogether  bewildered  and 
line 246=>bewuthered-this  was  the  most  awkward  Wednesday  he  ever  remembered.  He 
line 247=>pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More 
line 248=>dwarves,  four  more!  And  there  was  Gandalf  behind,  leaning  on  his  staff  and 
line 249=>laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, 
line 250=>knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. 
line 251=>"Carefully!  Carefully!"  he  said.  "It  is  not  like  you,  Bilbo,  to  keep  friends 
line 252=>waiting  on  the  mat,  and  then  open  the  door  like  a  pop-gun!  Let  me  introduce 
line 253=>Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!" 
line 254=>"At your service!" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they 
line 255=>hung  up  two  yellow  hoods  and  a  pale  green  one;  and  also  a  sky-blue one with  a 
line 256=>long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in 
line 257=>fact  no  other  than  the  great  Thorin  Oakenshield  himself,  who  was  not  at  all 
line 258=>pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. 
line 259=>For  one  thing  Bombur  was  immensely  fat  and  heavy.  Thorin  indeed  was  very 
line 260=>haughty,  and  said  nothing  about  service;  but  poor Mr. Baggins  said  he was  sorry 
line 261=>so  many  times,  that  at  last  he  grunted  "pray  don't  mention  it,"  and  stopped 
line 262=>frowning. 
line 263=>"Now we  are  all here!"  said Gandalf,  looking  at  the  row of  thirteen hoods-the 
line 264=>best  detachable  party  hoods-and his own hat hanging on  the pegs. "Quite a merry 
line 265=>gathering! 
line 266=>I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? 
line 267=>Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me." "And for me," said Thorin. 
line 268=>"And raspberry jam and apple-tart," said Bifur. "And mince-pies and cheese," said 
line 269=>Bofur.  "And  pork-pie  and  salad,"  said  Bombur.  "And  more  cakes-and  ale-and 
line 270=>coffee, if you don't mind," called the other dwarves through the door.  
line 271=>
line 272=>####-"Put  on  a  few  eggs,  there's  a  good  fellow!"  Gandalf  called  after  him,  as  the 
line 273=>hobbit  stumped  off  to  the  pantries.  "And  just  bring  out  the  cold  chicken  and 
line 274=>pickles!"

of  my  larders  as  I  do  myself!" 
line 276=>thought Mr. Baggins, who was  feeling  positively  flummoxed,  and was  beginning 
line 277=>to wonder whether  a most wretched  adventure  had  not  come  right  into his house. 
line 278=>By  the  time he had got all  the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses 
line 279=>and  plates  and  spoons  and  things  piled  up  on  big  trays,  he  was  getting  very  hot, 
line 280=>and red in the face, and annoyed. 
line 281=>"Confusticate  and  bebother  these  dwarves!"  he  said  aloud.  "Why  don't  they 
line 282=>come and lend a hand?" Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door 
line 283=>of  the  kitchen,  and  Fili  and Kili  behind  them,  and  before  he  could  say  knife  they 
line 284=>had  whisked  the  trays  and  a  couple  of  small  tables  into  the  parlour  and  set  out 
line 285=>everything afresh. 
line 286=>Gandalf  sat  at  the  head  of  the  party with  the  thirteen,  dwarves  all  round:  and 
line 287=>Bilbo  sat  on  a  stool  at  the  fireside,  nibbling  at  a  biscuit  (his  appetite  was  quite 
line 288=>taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly  ordinary and. not in the 
line 289=>least  an  adventure. The  dwarves  ate  and  ate,  and  talked  and  talked,  and  time  got 
line 290=>on.  At  last  they  pushed  their  chairs  back,  and  Bilbo  made  a  move  to  collect  the 
line 291=>plates and glasses. 
line 292=>"I suppose you will all stay to supper?" he said in his politest unpressing tones. 
line 293=>"Of  course!"  said Thorin.  "And  after. We  shan't  get  through  the  business  till  late, 
line 294=>and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!" 
line 295=>Thereupon  the  twelve  dwarves-not  Thorin,  he  was  too  important,  and  stayed 
line 296=>talking  to  Gandalf-jumped  to  their  feet  and  made  tall  piles  of  all  the  things.  Off 
line 297=>they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on 
line 298=>the  top,  with  one  hand,  while  the  hobbit  ran  after  them  almost  squeaking  with 
line 299=>fright:  "please  be  careful!"  and  "please,  don't  trouble!  I  can  manage."  But  the 
line 300=>dwarves only started to sing: 
line 301=> 
line 302=>
line 303=>Chip the glasses and crack the plates! 
line 304=>Blunt the knives and bend the forks! 
line 305=>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates- 
line 306=>Smash the bottles and burn the corks! 
line 307=> 
line 308=>Cut the cloth and tread on the fat! 
line 309=>Pour the milk on the pantry floor! 
line 310=>Leave the bones on the bedroom mat! 
line 311=>
line 312=>####-Splash the wine on every door! 
line 313=> 
line 314=>Dump the crocks in a boiling bawl; 
line 315=>Pound them up with a thumping pole; 
line 316=>And when you've finished, if any are whole, 
line 317=>Send them down the hall to roll ! 
line 318=> 
line 319=>That's what Bilbo Baggins hates! 
line 320=>So, carefully! carefully with the plates! 
line 321=>
line 322=> 
line 323=>And  of  course  they  did  none  of  these  dreadful  things,  and  everything  was 
line 324=>cleaned  and  put  away  safe  as  quick  as  lightning,  while  the  hobbit  was  turning 
line 325=>round  and  round  in  the middle of  the kitchen  trying  to  see what  they were doing. 
line 326=>Then  they  went  back,  and  found  Thorin  with  his  feet  on  the  fender  smoking  a 
line 327=>pipe. He was  blowing  the most  enormous  smoke-rings, and wherever he  told one 
pipe. He was  blowing  the most  enormous  smoke-rings, and wherever he  told one
